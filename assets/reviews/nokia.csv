I like to take pictures and with this camera it is easy. I track e-mails also easy.

It was glitchy from the 2nd day and just got worse after that. You can't take the battery out so if it freezes up, you have to go get a new one altogether. Which, would be fine if you could take it to the Verizon store and swap it, but since I purchased it on Amazon they make you go through them and you are stuck without a phone. I understand that some phones are just defective, but that was not the only thing I dislike about this phone. * I came from a Galaxy S2 to this, and it did not have SOOO many of the basic features or sound settings that I would expect from the typical phone. There's only one sound setting for EVERYTHING. * I got this because of the camera and the excellent reviews, there are very little cool things you can do with this camera and I wasn't impressed with the photos. * TOTALLY lacking in apps. And I really don't use a ton of apps or play any games! Just the basic stuff you want! I am now a proud owner of the Galaxy S4 and love it completely. Camera and all.

901,B00836Y6B2,Mr. Evolution,5,9-Nov-13,True,This one is definitely worth looking into,"I've had my phone for about 3 1/2 weeks now, so I think it's time to write a review let me be the first to say I would give this five stars. If I didn't have to deal with as zune application constantly telling me that my phone is not connected so onto the phone review the phone is solid. It's it's a great phone. It's true what they say it does not have this many apps as the Google play store . But before you go and look for another phone from me saying that this phone. The apps that they offer for this phone actually work. They have some really fun games apps that are really useful not just a bunch of apps take up space on your phone. The icons are large to start with, you can make them smaller. If you want you can pen things to your start screen like you would any other phone because zune does not seem to want to work and I'm not the only one that seems to have this problem to the oxidation because a lot of people have the same problem. What I had to do was make my phone into a USB mass storage device that way I can drop my music over to it. I can use my phone as a music player while I'm at work. The speaker is more than decent in the battery seems to last for ever. Or I should say it will last a lot longer than most cell phones. I play with my friends iPhone just to see if I would like it before I even bought this phone to be completely honest with you I am more than happy with this phone, and I highly recommend anyone who is looking to get a solid phone that will make phone calls of course take beautiful pictures respond quickly and not have to stick it on the charger every night, then this is going to be the phone for you. I read reviews where people were saying that they didn't like the pictures that the camera took to be completely honest with you I don't know what they're talking about the pictures that my phone takes their really nice. They even have a little apps in the App Store for free where you can add light little special effects to your pictures a flashlight app calendar apps that are built into the phone already. This is a functional phone into be on you is not going to be for everyone. There's a lot of people who are canis dock on the iPhone craze that will quickly shy away from you know, a Windows phone, but I think this is phone puts iPhone to shame. Even people I work with that have iPhones keep asking me how much did my phone cost and where did I get it. And these are your iPhone is the best thing ever type of people. The one thing I'm still try to figure out and if there's anybody who can help me with this, please do is how to update my phone without using zune so once again I have to give this phone a solid five. Given that the music player application Zune doesn't seem to like to connect to computers, but I can still move my music over to my phone, so it's not enough for me to drop a star off of it . And if there's anyone who is looking into getting one of these go to your local AT&T store and grab one in touch it , fiddle around with it to figure out if you like it or not",1.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0

If AT&T or T-Mobile coverage is good in your area, I would highly recommend going with them instead of Verizon who alters the phone operating system to stick you with hidden costs. I have two Lumia 822 phones, and enabling Visual Voicemail will cost me $143.52 extra compared to T-Mobile or AT&T.

20529,B07HD3QC65,Kyle Mlynarski,1,9-Jun-19,True,This is an Excellent Phone - That is until you have a problem,"To preface this, the Nokia 7.1 is a solid mid range handset that I used to be able to recommend to almost anyone. I say used to because I recently had to deal with their support and boy is it .... something. My phone too experienced the issue where the USB C port was loose and stopped charging the device except at odd angles. I had only had the phone for just over 3 months. You can find many reviews here that mention this issue. Nokia support took the time to attempt to blame me for their well documented manufacturing defect and after some convincing said they would send over the warranty claim to e-mail. Nothing Was ever sent. Call #2: Call back and explain the situation and am told that I will need to send the phone in for repairs and that I would be without a phone for 7-10 business days. What was I to do without a phone for those 7-10 business days? Not Nokia's problem. Contact the retailer you bought it from. I had to explain to the supervisor that In the United States it is generally the responsibility of the manufacturer to handle the warranty after the retailers return period (Usually around 30 days). Well that wasn't his problem, contact the retailer to see if they will help you. Said he would send documents to my e-mail address within 20 minutes. 1 Day later, no documents. It took the third call to finally get an agent to finally send over these mysterious ""documents"", though I will still be without a working phone for 7-10 business days. Thanks Nokia! Nokia apparently hasn't heard of customer service or even industry standards like advanced device replacement, where they place a hold on your credit card for the full cost of the device and send you a new device and ask you to return the old one and once you do release the hold. I had recommenced this device to quite a few people before i began experiencing issues. I can tell you that Never again will I recommend Nokia or purchase any of their products.

20506,B07HD3QC65,beabuthers,2,9-Jul-19,True,Great Phone with Design Flaw - Charging Port Issues,"Let me preface by saying I love this phone.... I really do.... it's a good value, the design aesthetic is beautiful.... HOWEVER.... I've had this phone since December 2018 and just about 2 months or so ago, the charging port started to become loose - this appears to be a common issue for many Nokia devices. At the same time I got mine, I also ordered my mom a Nokia 3.1. Hers is starting to have the same issue as well. Apparently, if you use Nokia phones while charging them, or as you plug and unplug the charger cable over time, the charger port becomes extremely loose and wobbly. It started off as a minor annoyance; not quite connecting/engaging the charge, but if you wiggled the cord, it would charge. After a while, the fast charge wouldn't engage, but the normal charge would still go. It continued to progress, with various degrees of not-charging.... we went from annoyance to full on failure within a couple of weeks. There were times it would only charge if I had the cord at a certain angle and pinched the phone in my hand. Other times I could get it to charge just by propping the phone up and angling the cord. Finally, it would not charge at all without consistent pressure on the cord at exactly the right point. At the end, I was practically performing acrobatics to get this phone to charge. There are multiple forum posts on the official Nokia forums regarding many different models with this same issue…. I wish with all my heart that Nokia would issue a statement or address the issue in some way but I can’t find any official response or even an acknowledgement of the issue. These are excellent phones aside from this problem. I am extremely sad and disappointed, as I was extremely, extremely happy with my 7.1 until the charging port went wobbly. As this issue seems to be across the board with all of Nokia’s USB-C charging ports…. I’m afraid I can’t recommend them to anyone at this time. I got 7 months out of it. If you submit it to Nokia to get it fixed, what I’ve gathered is, there are long lead times because of insufficient part availability, and the issue will resurface again because replacing a faultily designed object with another faultily designed object isn’t actually fixing anything, it’s giving you another 6 months or so until your warranty is up and you have to replace it on your own (but you can’t find the legit OEM part so you’re basically done for anyway and have to order a new phone.) 2 stars for the aesthetics and the attempt to build a good quality mid-range phone.

Great screen size and the OS just gets better and better. Plus the ability to look at, edit and create documents in Word, Excel and PowerPoint is awesome. In PowerPoint you also have the ability to view and edit your slides and notes from the phone and with the Icon the text is big enough that you can see it if your phone is on a podium. The camera is unbelievable. Great low light capabilities and takes much better photos than my wife's Galaxy S5. Very easy to learn how to use if you are new to the Windows mobile OS.

However, in day to day use, this phone is abysmal! I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy and be productive with this phone in this day and age. Granted, yes, my daily driver is a Samsung Galaxy S8+ that's many times more expensive then this phone, but come on ! This Nokia is $60. That's a good price but who is the target purchaser besides we fans from yesteryear? Pros: -It's small and compact. -it's rugged . I dropped it on the floor several times to charm friends . -Looks cool. -Nostalgia factor. Cons -Low (earpiece) speaker volume. -3G speeds -No Wifi -Poor camera -Can't use keypad when checking voicemail. -Opera Mini Browser + 3G speed, forget even the most basic web surfing -Cost (it should cost $30 or less) In closing I would just like to say that any productivity you used to enjoy on your smart phone is non existent here.

I must say; the OS is clean, beautiful, fast and functional. I came from using Android and Blackberry, and I would definitely not go back as long as the Windows Phone platform continues to improve. The Lumia 920 has the best screen I have yet seen on a phone. The body is very solidly contructed and asthetically pleasing. I keep getting passing comments about how nice it looks and people love to ask questions about it. I have nothing but good things to say about it. And to those who criticize the smaller (but rapidly growing) app list of about 120,000 apps at this point...the criticism is fair, but I'd like to add to that: when I got my first phone, it was the Nexus One. Back then, the Android platform was just beginning to show its promise (when there was so much optimism about the open OS, and the ""Don't be evil"" mantra, before Google decided to become the new Apple with its practices, but I digress), but at that time the app store was small as well and lacked many of the popular apps from the Iphone, but I stuck with it because I preferred the OS and the future promise of the platform. It paid off eventually...Years later, here comes Windows Phone 8 with a new set of promises and a shiny new OS to showcase. Again I made the switch. I love the design standards that Microsoft has set, with its clean and uniform experience across most apps on the system. The ability to share just about every media on your phone and in apps is far better than both iOS and Android, and the people app, which seamlessly integrates contacts from all of your popular social media platforms and email is a joy to use. Office is a great feature to have as well as OneNote. The camera is great and the camera apps are fun and functional. The Nokia drive and maps apps are wonderful and accurate. The Xbox Music store is great and a nice upgrade from the now-defunct Zune platform (sad face). The games app is great. The SmartGlass feature is awesome and innovative (it kind of defeats the purpose of the Wii U in my opinion). I mean, what else can I say? The call quality is solid. Messaging is a breeze. NFC is interesting and has useful applications. Internet explorer works just fine with everything I need to use it for. Nokia City Lens is cool. There are lots of settings and ways to customize your phone. In closing I will say that I can't emphasize how much I enjoy having this new phone to play with and use in my everyday life.

I spent several months considering my options and settled on the Nokia Windows 8 phone, partly because I'm a Windows user and partly because of the extra-good camera. Over the next two weeks I had a lot of problems with it, mostly software-related, so I traded it in for an Android. Whenever I get a new piece of equipment, I like to start off with the user guide in front of me so I can survey the features and be sure I understand how everything works. The introductory booklet said I could get a user guide by downloading it or by calling Nokia or Verizon . The guide was full of graphics and fancy fonts and choked up my printer so I called first Nokia and then Verizon. Both said that they would not send me a user guide. An obliging Verizon store rep finally printed one for me. I connected the phone to my Windows 7 laptop. It found the phone and gave me a link to download the necessary software. I downloaded it and tried to install it but got the following error message: ""Windows Phone requires Net framework 4.0. Please install from '[...]"" No actual link was given and the address didn't work but I managed to find the necessary page and downloaded the software. After that the laptop recognized the phone but I was not able to set up playlists using either Windows Media Player or Zune and finally gave up on that. I haven't taken the time to tackle this issue on the Android. I'm still using my old phone to play music at the gym. When I tried to get help from Nokia and Verizon they didn't seem to know what to do either. If manufacturers of hospital equipment or kitchen appliances treated their customers this way there would be lawsuits; why do we tolerate this sort of behavior in the case of tech companies? The front screen of the Nokia phone with the flipping tiles was very cute and I loved being able to make a little mini version of my blog page there but these features were not enough to compensate for the hassles.

It still vibrates but the vibrate is weak and sick feeling. I am going to send it back for one in better condition.

The only way to get the latest version of Windows is to sign up for some kind of beta test where Microsoft can dump all of there crappy untested software into your phone so it can be their test subject. If you get a used phone take in consideration that the battery won't last as long either.,1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

I used to have all kind of models of Nokia (3310, 6600, E71, ... etc.) and last one was N8 it was really slow after I used it for more than a year. When I take out my 920 I don't think that I'm gonna be embarrassed. Because whatever I did on my N8 it took me couple or less than a second to do on my Nokia Lumia 920. Love everything in it, except battery sometime acting crazy, but it's all understandable with LCD screen, LTE and couple features that draw battery faster. One more flaw is in OS, it seemed to me a little limited from customization and of course lack of notification center. Overall great smartphone with perfect design, and rich history.

I was disappointed it didn't run Android 10 yet, with Android One I expected it would come loaded with it but supposedly it's coming in the next month or two... The biggest complaints I could find online were around the battery life which I think is just silly. It's mAh is way better than a lot of the competition (Pixel namely).

20557,B07HD3QC65,Valasis Vafiadis,5,9-Dec-18,True,"Great phone, especially for the price.","This phone is a gem for the price. I had a Nexus 5X before, and this phone is a much higher quality version of that. First, it almost fit perfectly in the cases I had for the 5X, except for the buttons on on the side, which are opposite (Nokia style). But while I was waiting for my new case to arrive, it was sufficient for a couple of days. And for running, I still use my old 5X running cases. Otherwise, if you had a 5X, you will feel very comfortable with this phone. The rear fingerprint scanner is in the same place, the size is the same. But that's where the similarities end. The Nokia has a fantastically large screen that is very crisp. Old games may have trouble with the larger screen, as they get expanded a little. Once I upgraded to Android Pie, the battery life blows away the 5X. With normal use, the battery can last me a day and a half. With battery saver on, it can last 2 days. I attribute this to the battery AI in pie, but it's a great, unexpected perk since the battery reviews have only been average. The phone is a little heavier than the 5X, but that's only because it's much sturdier. And it looks so nice, I only had to get a clear case. Really, the only complaint I have is the speakers that are below average on the phone. But since I use my bluetooth headset or my external bluetooth speakers to play music, it's not an issue at all. I can go on and on (the camera is solid with some really cool features, the processor is really fast for everything I do since I don't do 3D gaming), but it was such a good phone, I also bought one for my wife and she loves it.

The screen is a gorgeous 720p display with deep blacks, vibrant colors, and a 60hz refresh rate that's buttery smooth. Nokia threw every feature in this beast they could think of. Optical Image Stabilization, which allows the phone to compensate for tiny movements and also makes it possible for this device to take low-light photos you will not believe. It has HAAC microphones for recording sound up to 140db. If you every have the desire to record at a concert, this phone will give you the best audio hands down. Wireless charging, super-sensitive screen that can be used with gloves, NFC... I think I hit them all, but I may have missed something.

Quintero,4,9-Dec-12,False,Almost there,"PROS-------- -The speed is great. -Beautiful screen and great in sun light. -Touch screen works in the cold and with ordinary gloves on. -Great Sound, video and still shots. -hard uni-body of the phone seems very durable -tethering is simple to use great to use. CONS------ -Customization is lacking can't customize SMS notification tones, system font, etc. -NO MEMORY EXPANSION! -No reminder LED for missed texts, current e-mails, or missed calls. -Camera settings - not enough of them. I have had this phone for about two weeks and I love it. The battery life is great the phone runs lean so it doesn't run the battery down. The screen is beautiful to look at and use. I live in the northeast so it is getting cold and I love that you can use the touch screen while using regular gloves. The colors coming out of that screen are beautiful and vibrant. The phone is very fast and responsive so it has no problem running the new Windows 8 that it comes with. The camera is very nice and it takes some really nice pictures even in dim light. Voice calls are the clearest and the most noise free I have heard on any smartphone that I have owned so far. The outer shell of the phone is very strong and tough although it is a bit slippery for me at times since I picked the Yellow one. I got it while the offer for the free NFC wireless charger was offered so I have that as an accessory and it is really neat. Like that I can just lay the phone onto the wireless charger and not have to mess with the tiny USB connector for the regular wall charger. The wireless charger seems to take little longer than the wall charger. Overall Nokia has done a good job at the phone design like they have in the past. I owned a Nokia 5160 and that bad boy was heavy but tough as nails. The Lumia 920 reminds me of that toughness. Now what I don't like about the phone is the lack of features and setting in the software. Yes the Windows 8 tiles interface is easy to navigate and figure out. Yes you can move the tiles around and ""customize"" where your tiles are on the screen. Yes you can ""pin"" things and apps to your main screen. What you can't do is really customize the phone to be ""for each of us"" like Microsoft advertises. You can add special ringtones for your calls but you can't do the same for anything else. You are stuck with the boring and not as loud notification tones setup by Microsoft and Nokia. There is no notification led light on the phone for missed calls either. I could have said that during while I was talking about the hardware but since everything is controlled by software they could have used the software to control some of the navigation lights that are present in the front to notify you that there was a missed call or a message waiting for you - perhaps light up the ""windows logo"" light to a constant pulse. You can't change the phone's system fonts or much of anything else that you could think of. I am sorry if it may seems petty but if the phone's operating system is advertised to be ""for the each of us"" that means customization to the max and I don't see it in the Windows phone 8 OS. Add more customization to your OS Microsoft, please, ""for each of us"".

15463,B075FL4H89,Chris,4,9-Apr-18,False,"Helps me kick my smartphone ""addiction"" and brings focus back to my life","I upgraded my smart phone this past Christmas and found myself staring at it more than ever. I was handing over so much of my brain power – navigating around my neighborhood, setting reminders, and idly flicking through various social feeds – that at some point, the stress of always multi-tasking while ignoring what was going on around me finally needed to be addressed. I was also inspired by the ""light phone"" Kickstarter marketing campaign, but couldn't wait for or spend hundreds of dollars on a basic phone. Enter this little gadget, which I use for calls, texts, my morning alarm, a reminder or two, and THAT'S IT! Before I list the pro's and con's, I should specify that the device I bought was the 2015 version from Best Buy. I think it's had a few interface upgrades since then, but it was readily available to pick up at only about $60, so I'm satisfied. Pros: - Tiny and super light; great when you're used to carrying a phablet with a case and pop socket in one pocket - Phenomenal battery life! My device hasn't touched a charger in days and still has a full bar - Volume is LOUD if you want it to be (In fact, you're going to want to turn it down as soon as you boot it up for the first time!) - Was able to easily transfer contacts both by Bluetooth and by saving to my SIM card - Has everything you need as a communication device, and little else; GREAT for minimalists, terrible for people who live by their smart phones (though just like me, that may catch up to them) - It's unlocked, meaning most carriers will be able to use it, and the lack of features means you can probably cut your phone bill by half or more (I use Cricket since I live in a fairly metropolitan area, and went from a $60/mo unlimited data plan to their lowest data plan: 2GB for $30/mo) - Images can be received and sent; not something I regularly do, but still nice to know I won't get an error message like on other basic phones I've had in the past - Rudimentary browser comes as a feature; not something I'd ever use, but it's nice to know it's there in case of emergency - Mini USB port makes it SO easy to find a charger that fits; thankfully, most of phone manufacturers are adopting this now, which certainly wasn't the case in the age of flip phones Cons: - My man hands are slimmer than most, but I definitely had to practice using the middle rocker ring a lot without constantly hitting the confirmation button it surrounds - T9 can be tough to pick up again. Texting takes at least twice as long. There's a predictive text feature which definitely speeds things up, but I found myself wanting a little more freedom. - I noticed the first time I began receiving texts, the notification for them would be stuck on the home screen even after deleting the messages. I contacted Nokia support and they said the only ""fix"" was a factory reset. I did that a few days ago, and have yet to encounter another stuck notification. - NO EMOJIS! Okay, so this probably isn't a huge deal for most people, and I acknowledge that it's silly to get upset over not being able to send little icons to my friends. Still, I would have thought since the phone came out in the last couple of years, and because it receives other images, there would be emoji support. Unfortunately, all you see is squares. :( - No WiFi To wrap up: I still use my smartphone on certain occasions for taking photos, listening to downloaded music on a long drive, or using the GPS function to navigate to strange places (Google Maps lets you download an entire state if you want!), but the great thing is that I don't HAVE to. It mostly stays in a drawer, and I know that if I ever had to switch back briefly, I can just pop the SIM card out of this little guy and pop it into there for as long as I need. ----------- 3 MONTH UPDATE: Having used this device for 3 months, I've gained some more clarity, lost a bit of the hype, and therefore have to dock a star. It's absolutely a 4-star device, however the call volume is really not spectacular, and that's a real problem. When I'm on the road, I have to really push it to my ear if I want to make out what the other person is saying through the earpiece. I bought a bluetooth headset to remedy this, but it's not that much louder. Its condition has held up despite being dropped and scratched on occasion, and I'm now a WHIZ at T9 again, LOL! But I found a flip phone that has bigger keys, 4G, and a louder earpiece, so it looks like I'll be switching to that.",3.0,Nokia,Nokia 3310 3G - Unlocked Single SIM Feature Phone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 2.4 Inch Screen - Charcoal,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3310-3G-Unlocked-T-Mobile/dp/B075FL4H89,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iQ4QgMchL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FL4H89,497,54.99,59.0

3660,B00HWEMZ1E,mjwatts,5,9-Apr-14,False,I adore this phone,"Let me preface this by saying, I did not want a Windows Phone. I get very attached to my devices, and I was heartbroken last summer when my Droid Bionic's battery was shot and I traded it in for a Galaxy S4. However, the S4 completely blew my Bionic out of the water and I had some good times with it until it broke, and Verizon refused to replace it despite it still being under warranty. A family member got this phone for free and gave it to me to check out, and I love it. -The Windows Phone 8 OS is great. Everything runs so fast. If you play around a bit with the size/location of the icons on the homescreen, you can fit a lot in there which is nice. -Everyone complains about the lack of apps, and this is unavoidable. There are a lot more of the well used apps than when I originally looked into a Windows phone last summer, and more are becoming available by the day. There are also unofficial apps for many popular apps not present in the store that are awesome alternatives. (I like the unofficial Snapchat app (6snap) more than I like the official Android snapchat app). -I've seen complaints about the battery life, but for me it feels pretty comparable to my S4. With basic usage (phone calls/texts throughout the day) I can easily make it through an entire on a charge. If I'm using it more heavily, especially when streaming music from Spotify, then it may only take me to 9-10pm without charging it throughout the day. Vast improvement to my Bionic, and pretty comparable to my S4. -As many others have said, the camera on this phone is amazing. There is a slight shutter delay that can be annoying, but the picture quality makes it all worth it. -The build of the phone is a bit heavy/bulky (especially if you're coming from an iPhone). It's not something that bothers me, but always something to consider if that's an issue for you. -Finally, as many have said, the GPS/Nokia maps on this phone are absolutely incredible. You have the ability to download maps and use turn by turn navigation offline, which is super nice if you don't want to blow through your data just using navigation. It's very accurate (more so than Google Maps in my opinion) and gives good directions.

20490,B07HD3QC65,Kazi Hassan,3,8-Nov-18,True,"Overall good phone, some experience has followed me to bring attention on issues","Based on the reviews and overall appeal of the device, I preordered the nokia 7.1 after doing bit of digging through about the device, I would say that there weren't really any other device within the price range, stock android, nice aesthetic for mid range phone. Here my in depth review of my nokia 7.1, Upon receiving it, I like the look of it, with glass material Build Quality and color tone is navy blue, which in my opinion looks incredible. Comes in minimalist box with the phone snugged away along with charger , USB-C cable and unappealing headphone. I was under the impression that android pie would be ready out of the box as it had mentioned in the description of the page. The screen is quite vivid, from the price point, it;s good. The HDR is a really nice feature added. One thing to point is that, while watching any video content, appears to have black bars which crops more of the screen ratio. It kind of ruin's the experience of watching a video. On the other hand, The performance of the phone so far has been okay through out . I haven't used in the intensive benchmark testing. It can handle daily activities, I do happen to experience shudder sometimes, depending on the activities I am doing, especially opening up the camera. I have experienced one thing, when restarting the device, it takes bit longer than expected. Being this as a android ONE, the experience left me thinking that it should have more fluid from switching app. I am on Tmobile with lte, Full Bar and connection are strong, I live in metropolitan city, where I have used in subway, building. The phone has good battery life through out the day. My activities are usually are combination of wifi and 4G network (calls, SMS checking mails, reading news, transportation app, watching content, browse ). I have to do extensive monitoring of how much the battery drains from these usage. Obviously, using 4g network entire day, it will drain more quicker. In terms of camera, I haven;t played around so much, I have taken few picture at the daytime, with ample sunlight, it looks great. There is a lot of modes (PRO, Portraits etc) to choose from and another cool feature like dual pic simultaneous taken. Here is where my experience have come with issue, I hope this problem will sure bring some kind of enlightenment,I have noticed this from yesterday, When I am on hd call, or on a speaker call, The call volume sounds is very low, In my experience , Normally speaker sounds gets high. The thing is that, while watching media content on Netflix or YouTube. The speaker sound loud and clear. Even when I am listening to my Voicemail or other sound notification. Also, I checked with Whatsapp, Telegram calls, it sounds perfectly fine with speaker and on call. I tried to see if problem persist in Safe Mode, it happens in call and the speaker sound. This is almost like the person on the other end sounds far distance from the phone. Overall, The build quality is great and its pleasing to look at; feels solid. For now, with the issue which has arise, I would like to get some answer. Minus point, No LED indicator on the phone. Better performance for phone like this quality. Not a lot of selection of cases.

I purchased it for a friend in a transitional home. During treatment they are not allowed camera phons or phones with internet access. Do you realize how hard those are to find these days?! I found this one and one being sold for well over $100. No thanks. I’ll try this one. It works on the old 2G network so I hooked it up with MetroPCS by T-Mobil. It’s not locked like others have stated, they probably just tried using it on a network like AT&T that doesn’t support 2G anymore. I believe t-mobile/metroPCS might be the only major company that still has the 2G network but I could be wrong. Maybe other pay as you go companies use it as well. It does have a flashlight feature along with a radio that picks up local stations if you hook up some headphones and a bunch of old school games like Snake. You cannot send or receive picture messages or emojis. It’s a throwback phone to before technology took off. If you’re looking for a phone without internet and camera, this is your guy. Or if you’re just in need of a super cheap throw away Trak phone. It serves its purpose.

3608,B00HWEMZ1E,Amazon Customer,5,8-Jul-14,False,Premium Windows Phone 8 Experience,"My first experience with Nokia was with a Lumia 928, which I absolutely loved. That experience made me love Windows Phone 8 and showed me just how limited android devices are. When it came time to upgrade, I knew I wanted another Lumia because I couldn't stand the thought of being stuck with a ""premium"" android device that forced Google down my throat. As soon as I finished the activation if my new Icon, I could see that it was an improvement from the already very goof 928. The scene is a little more crisp, video playback is fantastic thanks to an impressively powerful 2.2 GHz processor- my only limitation is the quality of the WiFi service, and the available apps have been growing quite a bit (some apps are not available on less powerful windows phone devices because they lack the power to handle the high detail density but I have only noticed this to apply to games, not productivity apps). Games are, by the way, fantastic. Microsoft has a large selection of Xbox games available on WP8 like Halo. The experience is different from the gaming console but it is still a lot of fun. Also, Here apps are, in every way, the equal or even superior to Google Maps. I am able to accomplish a lot with my Icon thanks to the preinstalled Office app which is impressively convenient. Before I tried it the first time I expected the experience to make blood shoot from my eyes, but I was blown away by how user friendly it was. I can write documents, create spreadsheets including graphs, and assemble PowerPoint presentations. Also, documents created on the Icon preserve their formatting when opened on a desktop or tablet! The reverse is also true. The camera takes pictures with excellent detail, but be aware that the higher pixel density requires the lenses to focus a little longer for the highest quality shots. Also, the picture colors are real to life, so don't expect the colors to pop in an exaggerated way like they do on some android phones unless you opt for a different app. Speaking if apps, Nokia has several apps to modify or combine pictures- you can even make a ""picture"" with a moving part. That feature is especially fun for capturing activities like fly fishing where the movement really sets it apart from normal fishing. Call quality is the same as with the 928, which is to say it is very good. Even in areas where signal is weak- like basements with concrete walls- the call quality is still great.

1815,B00A7F57EM,Wilson,3,8-Jul-13,False,Slightly Disappointing,"As someone who is very into Andriod, I decided to go out on a limb and try out the Windows OS. I have had this phone for about a year now. I am not going to lie, I am pretty disappointed by the phone and the operating system. but it works alright for what it is. PHONE: I have issues once or twice a week where the phone will shut off unexpectedly. After consistently happening for this long, I was hoping a software update would help fix the issue but it clearly has not. This leads me to believe it is a hardware issue, but the people at Verizon keep telling me it's a software issue and the next update would fix it. As far as durability, this phone is an absolute tank. I have yet to put a case on my phone (living dangerously) and I have dropped it a handful of times. There are some scratches on the corners of the plastic housing, but the screen is in perfect condition. The response time has it's ups and downs. Some times it will be lightning fast, some times it will lag a few seconds. I am always careful to kill all my tasks too. WINDOWS 8 OS: This OS looks sweet. I love the minimalistic layout and the customizability it has. In terms of function, it's kind of limited. Nokia has put out a bunch of really cool apps, like city lens and panorama. The GPS system it comes with is absolutely amazing. It beats all of my friends iPhones and Androids to crap. I would argue it rivals a legitimate GPS system for your car. But in actuality I don't use all of the stock apps to much. The live tile idea is awesome, but it rarely works how it should. They don't load properly until you open the apps, then they will update, which kind of defeats their purpose. The ideas they have going into the OS is great, but they need some optimization. App development is leagues behind Apple and Android. If you're someone who likes a lot of apps, you're going to have to rely on a bunch of 3rd party software. If you're okay with that than go ahead, but I prefer to go with the big developers. It seems like no one really makes quality apps for it. Give it a couple years, i bet it will be fine, but until then I am not going to rave about app availability. OVERALL: I will not be getting another windows phone. I would not really recommend it to anyone else unless you're more business oriented. As a college student I find Android and Apple will better suit my desires. It's not well enough developed for me to really get into it.

This phone has a impressing hardware but at the same time, disappointed software. One serious issue is that I can not go back to the previous page on Internet Explore. If I push go back button, it will go back directly to homepage which is really stupid. I do not really understand is this only my issue or the phone's issue. Because if it is phone's issue, many people should mentioned it already. Also, if you read a long article and want to go back to the top, you need to swipe fingers several times but on a Android phone, it is very easy to adjust your position. It will be help to have direction button on the keyboard since that way, it will be easier to change letters during a word but as far as I know, only Android phone has it. Also, so many apps available on App store or Play station cannot be found in windows store and some of them are necessary for my daily life. Furthermore, some software just can not behave on this phone as good as my old HTC. It also need a longer time to sync. Android has the best mail system in my opinion. Lumia's mail system is okay and personally, I like it better than apple's mail system. Battery life is reasonable. It has twice life time of my old HTC phone which basically lives on the charger.. and Nokia has a useful offline GPS system which I believe most phones do not.

4973,B00O15MWOM,Trim Tram,3,8-Dec-14,False,A bit of a letdown,"I got this as a black Friday deal, so this is largely an initial impression rather than an in-depth review. I have played around with other Windows Phones, including the predecessor Lumia 521, and considered using this as a possible gateway into the ecosystem in case I decide to switch from Android. The good things: The operating system is fairly snappy despite the low-end processor. Scrolling the home screen, using the internet search, internet explorer and Cortana are all very smooth with minimal lag. The UI is fairly intuitive and I like the overall look of Windows Phone OS. Wi-Fi was easy to connect to and most of the pre-installed apps also are responsive and fairly useful. The not so good: The biggest con, by far, is the lackluster screen. Compared to the last model, the Lumia 521, the Lumia 530 is a serious step back. The colors all look very washed out. Images look very pixelated, and text looks extremely blurry. Trying to read on this phone can quickly cause eye strain. I don't expect much for a phone in this price range, but this is probably the worst display I've seen since circa 2011 (and this includes many cheap Android phones). It's hard to recommend this phone for this reason alone. Other issues are fairly minimal (some lag switching between third-party apps, for example). Other cons include the very mediocre camera with no flash, though you cannot expect much at this price point. A bigger issue is that the body is very, very slippery. A case is likely required to prevent you from dropping the phone, which isn't ideal given that the phone is already very bulky. Based on the the cons, it's hard for me to recommend this over the 521, despite the 521's weaker processor. If you are considering Android and are willing to spend a bit more, I'd recommend the Moto G (or even Moto E) over this phone.

Lumia 920 is a great device to give that chance. Camera is another feature that you will love! Cinmeagraph is fun! And the photo quality is great! I did notice few issues with battery and Bluetooth usage. There are also some reports of constant reboots in the Nokia forums, but I haven't experienced those. Nokia Drive Beta app is the culprit that drains your battery like anything! But hey, its a beta app and I think it is expected. With regards to Bluetooth, sometimes it will not connect to my car's Bluetooth. Will have to switch off and switch on Bluetooth to make it work. Just to be clear that these issues might very well be related to the OS and Nokia can fix it with an update. It does not have a SD card extension but hey you get a massive 32GB storage! You can store a lot of things with 32GB! And with apps like SkyDrive, Box etc., you can keep your contents in the cloud so you can access it across your other devices.

As with any other Windows Phone it comes with 15 GB of free OneDrive storage space so you can easily transfer your pictures and videos to a computer (without the need for a transfer cable). It also comes with the mobile version of MS Office so you can easily open Word or Excel documents on the go. It also works well as a standalone car GPS with free lifetime updates to the maps which you can download upfront (over Wi-Fi) so that you don't need to use your data plan.

Options include the combination CR-123 Nokia 02736C7 Nokia Universal Holder CR-123 for Cell Phones - Car Mounts - Retail Packaging - Black with DC-17 Nokia DC-17 1A Micro USB Car Charger - Original OEM or the CR-200 Nokia CR-200 Wireless Charging Car Cradle Holder - Retail Packaging - Black (see also Verizon store).

1767,B00A2V7ULY,Andrew Swink,5,7-Sep-13,False,"Had it since release, no problems, no regrets","I got this phone a couple weeks after it came out. The camera is great, and was the best at release, which is what really drew me in to this product. HTC has since caught up and Nokia has blown by the competition once again with the Lumia 1020, but the camera on the 920 is still really solid and performs better than any Galaxy or iPhone (I've tested it myself, but there are plenty of comparisons around the internet). Now I feel it necessary to say I've been pretty firmly ingrained in Microsoft's ecosystem for some time, even before I got this phone, so switching from my buggy Samsung wasn't hard at all for me. I use Outlook, Skydrive, Xbox, Skype... you name the Microsoft product and I probably already used it. Still, the mail app works well with any domain (I've got a couple Gmail accounts synced to me phone, too) and if you don't already use SkyDrive, making the switch is as easy as copy and pasting from Dropbox. There are only a few ""must have"" apps still missing from the Windows Phone marketplace, but if the missing service is sufficiently popular there will almost always be a third party alternative to an official app (like with Instagram) so from my point of view the Windows Phone marketplace is just fine. I never try to find an app and come up empty handed, is what I'm saying. I'm sure there are some rare and specific apps that are missing and you absolutely MUST buy an iPhone, but for a casual user Windows Phone should be just fine. And even if there is something missing from Windows Phone that you'll miss (I admit there were a couple Android apps I was sorry to leave behind), there are so many great features built into the OS that make it by far my favorite. The People Hub is a great way to sort out contacts and make your social feeds more accessible, and you can make it so Facebook messages feed into the texting app, making conversations with your friends a bit more streamlined (and allowing you to easily converse over wifi). There are lots of other cool Windows Phone exclusive features that are worth checking out, but, you know, you have Google (or Bing, I guess). The fact that it never ever crashes is also great, though I hear since I ditched Android it's become more stable. I mentioned the camera earlier, but that's not the only great thing about the hardware. The screen is fantastic. It doesn't have the highest resolution ever, but it's still plenty HD and at normal viewing distances it looks perfect. It can be read in bright sunlight, with or without sunglasses. Super sensitive touch means you can use it with gloves, which would be great if I didn't live in Texas, I'm sure. Nokia's build quality is famous, and this phone is no exception. I've dropped it on concrete several times now, and nothing beyond a dent on the corner has marred my phone. I'd say it's invincible, but I imagine if you dropped it face first it might still shatter. It feels great in the hand thanks to the pleasant glossy material (it kind of sticks to my hands, which makes it slip resistant and also kind of icky, so you may want to get a black or blue one, because they have a different finish) and the curved screen is just really nice aesthetically and in terms of touch. In the end, if you're new to the smartphone scape, I wholeheartedly suggest getting a Windows Phone (preferably a Nokia). If you currently use another phone OS (iPhone, Android, Blackberry etc.) then you should give Windows Phone a careful look. It offers many things that other operating systems don't, and the only hardware manufacturer that gives Nokia a run for its money is HTC. I'm glad I made the switch.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Yellow 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Yellow-32GB/dp/B00A2V7ULY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kn06zWzvL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7ULY,45,184.18,0.0

Since that phone I have been very impressed with android and have constantly recommended android phones when people ask. Since the Incredible I have had the HTC Thunderbolt, Droid Charge, LG Spectrum, Droid Razr Maxx, and Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Although I never had issues with my android phones other than the occasional lag I decided that I wanted to try something different. I decided that windows phone was worth a try. In the end I didn't expect windows phone to be as refreshing, smooth, and functional as it is. The Nokia Lumia 928 is an excellent phone that is very well built. It is sturdier than any android phone I have used and competes with some of the early blackberry phones I owned as the most solidly built. The camera quality is amazing, definitely better than the quality on the galaxy note 2 I had been using prior to getting this phone. The thing that has really hooked me has been the software. After hearing what others had said I was expecting to get bored with the software quickly but that has not been the case. The software has been far more reliable than that of any other phone. It is also amazingly smooth. Apps open quickly and I have yet to have an app randomly close or give me any type of error. The battery life has been great and usually gets me through a day of heavy use. The only downside to this phone has been apps. Obviously, this is something that I expected when buying the phone. Yes, it does not have as many apps as IOS or Android but I do not find myself missing apps; there are enough popular apps that I do not feel that my overall experience is hindered on the platform. In the end I do not see myself switching platforms anytime soon.

2281,B00CQAODG4,M. Fox,5,7-Sep-13,False,Love the Phone but...,"wondering, for my lifestyle, if it warrents paying almost $900 a year more just for the use of it. While it has all the features I would like in a phone and more, I'm finding that I'm not really taking advantage of them all. I'm not a techie person. I don't sit in front of a computer emailing, twittering, and facebooking friends; and I'm not into games either. All I really have used this phone for so far is to make phone calls which I could do on any 'dumb' phone. That's something to consider when purchasing any smart phone. Will the useage warrant the extra cost? If you are like me, then it probably wouldn't. But if you aren't then you'll probably love this phone. It's superfast, has a lot of features that are (even for this old bat) very easy to use, and is fun. If I wasn't pinching my pennies because of this bad economy I would keep it in a heartbeat. But as the situation is now it looks like I'll be downgrading to a dumb phone. I'm updating this posting after contacting Verizon about switching back to an old fashioned flip phone. After all is said and done the total savings per month would only amount to around $20 a month. Seems Verizon has, along with everyone else, raised their rates and fixed it so that it wouldn't make economic sense to switch back. So, even though I probably won't be using the phone as much as some other users might, I'll be keeping the phone after all. If you have any reservations about upgrading to a smart phone make sure you check out how that is going to change your rates first because once your rate gets changed to a different tier it will never go back to the lower tier again. Live and learn as they say. When my contract is up I'll just have to switch to another carrier in order to go back to the flip phone rate. I'm not happy about that because I got a lot less dropped calls and better reception with Verizon than when I had AT&T.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

2270,B00CQAODG4,Blue,2,7-May-14,False,"Great camera, but heavy and glitchy","I find this phone heavy and very awkward to hold due to the square corners and buttons relatively low on the right side. Unfortunately this resulted in my dropping the phone several times, which eventually shattered the entire screen. However, long before the phone was ever dropped, it had some issues: 1) Poor call signal with any case on the phone. - I was instructed to remove the case (tried 3 different ones) because every time I put one on, the signal and call quality dropped significantly 2) Microsoft tech support finally confirmed this one: the Windows OS automatically modulates the master volume - so every time it goes to sleep or is turned fully off, the volume resets itself to 13/30 (was 19 then went down after an update) - volume adjusts itself down if it thinks you're listening to something that is too loud (i.e. to protect your hearing) - unfortunately the volume on the entire phone goes down, so you have nearly inaudible phone calls, alarms, ringers etc. 3) In addition to the automatic volume modulation (which is irritating even for someone like me with good hearing), my Nokia Lumia 928 would decrease the volume (audibly), but the volume setting still said 30/30 (this is not a Windows ""feature,"" and is a problem) - no matter how many times you turned the volume down then back up again, it still stayed at a low volume (even though it said 30/30) - the only solution to this was to turn the phone completely off and back on again, at which time it would display the true volume (13/30) and could be turned back up - except that the volume went right back down the minute it went to sleep or was turned off. 4) After 2 months of use, calls could no longer be heard reliably through the handset (i.e. had to use speakerphone or Bluetooth at all times). - I would call someone/receive a call and hear nothing until I turned on the speakerphone 5) After 3 months of use, the phone randomly would not place or receive phone calls despite good signal, and would randomly fail to send/receive texts. - this problem never happened when hooked to Bluetooth for some reason. 6) Phone repeatedly disconnected from certain wifi without picking it back up, even though the secure username and password had been entered - had to manually hook to some wifi every single time 7) The screen orientation randomly got stuck on vertical - so at times, I could not take or rotate pictures/videos/internet anything to the horizontal position All that said, the call quality is good if you can make or receive calls. The screen looks great, and this phone takes beautiful pictures with an outstanding flash for a phone. A major plus compared to many phones is that the Nokia Lumia still has an actual button for taking pictures/videos. Unfortunately this button is right where you need to grip the phone for doing anything other than taking pictures. Although heavy and fairly thick, it’s narrower than many phones. The wireless charging is a nice bonus, although I would rather give up this feature if the phone could be lighter. Overall, I suspect that the Windows OS is responsible for some of the glitches with this phone. So perhaps the Windows 8.1 update will fix some of the problems. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone before I could send it for warranty service, so I had to buy a new phone. I would probably not recommend this Nokia unless you mainly email and take pics/vids, but don’t talk on the phone or listen to music much. All together, I spent at least 20 cumulative hours on the phone or chatting with various tech supports (Verizon, Nokia, Microsoft) dealing with this phone's issues over the 8 months that I had it.

3622,B00HWEMZ1E,A.B. Lambert,5,7-Mar-14,False,Best Smartphone I ever USED.,"I was a not sure if I should jump to a Windows phone but I am glad I did. I had 3 Android phones and I was getting bored of them. It was all the same. The phone would perform great at the beginning and then start to lag (with the removing of some Apps issues). The final straw was the Samsung Galaxy S3. The RF and voice quality was not great (Was nothing Like my Moto Droid X [great mobile]). The Nokia screen quality is unbelievable and the RF is fantastic. I get signal in areas that I did not get with my GS3 (Like the back of my Grocery store) and I can put the phone down on my car console and still have GPS signal. I use this phone for business and home and the quality of Microsoft applications and services is outstanding (I would always get jealous of my friends IPhones and the business capabilities it had). I am not a download every app person, but I found all my apps I had on my GS3( was surprised that Waze was available with an update only couple weeks old), including local papers and bank. The battery seems to last for a while, but I am never far from some type of charger with any of my mobiles products. It did take me a week to get use to the Windows environment. At one point in the beginning I was not sure why I left my Android platform, but once I got used to the windows 8 OS I love it. I have tiles to show my information and not have to worry about widgets. I can not forget the unbelievably great camera quality. There is a superiorness (Not sure that is a real word) about the Lumia Icon and Windows 8 platform that makes me think I might end up being a real fan. I purchased my Lumia at the Verizon store so I had customer support answering questions I had. Also there is some big update to the OS in the next 3 or 4 months that is suppose to add even more features to the mobile (Verizon told me that). Overall I would recommend this product.

1529,B00A2V7BA4,rugby49,3,7-Mar-13,False,Nokia 920,"I did not buy from Amazon. Purchased from AT&T corporate store about 5 days ago. I have not used a Windows phone since the PocketPC days and switched from an Iphone 5. Did not have a whole lot to transfer over except for contacts from Google which occurred flawlessly. I was able to hook up Bluetooth to my Acura without a problem. Calls are clear and plenty loud. The screen is exceptional and does work with gloves which is a tremendous plus when skiing. I like the live tiles, only some apps have this function. I had a problem for awhile transferring my DMR free music from Itunes on my MacBook pro until I checked the box in the Windows Phone Software for Mac, ""Allow Access to Folder"". The one issue I have is streaming over Bluetooth. The sound is terrible especially in the car and the volume is extremely low. I am 59 and do not play music so everyone within 20 feet can hear it, but I do want to hear it over the treadmill. I purchased the Jaybird Sportsband just before Christmas. Worked great with Iphone 5. With the Nokia the sound is muddied, kind of mono sounding, and volume is low with both the phone and headset cranked up. The phone has no sound controls for wireless headsets and does not support all features apparently that the headset might have. I found that if I turn the volume down using the Sportsband, the phone stays maxed at 30 and I cannot use the Sportsband to turn the volume back up. I have to delete the device from the Bluetooth app and then sync it again. When I get home on Friday I will try it with 3 other Wireless headsets I have, but I have a feeling that this is a Win 8 software limitation at the moment. For me this is a big limitation as I have been wireless for awhile now and play music solely over Bluetooth. I will try the Sportsband with another Win 8 phone at the store along with the display Nokia 920 to see if my phone has a problem or again if this is a Win 8 phone limitation.

1648,B00A2V7BA4,Erika,4,7-Jun-13,False,"Only phone with offline GPS, indestructible, solid quality","Despite some shortcomings I'm really happy that I decided to buy the Lumia. I found a way around most negatives and I haven't found a better phone yet. Overall, what impressed me the most is what I didn't find: annoying bugs in the operating system. There are really very few. Windows Phone 8 seems much more stable and mature than my husband's Android phone or my Android tablet. (I refuse to use Apple because they use too many proprietary things and don't ""play well"" with other systems, so I can't really compare it to iOS). Here is what I found(I explain the ""why"" in more detail below): 1) Really great: - Fully functional offline GPS with free worldwide maps (works also on my Europe vacation, w/o insane data charges or even a SIM card) 2) Pretty good: - Physical button for camera and video - Build and quality (no need for a protective case) - Voice recognition (works even with an accent) - Playing Nokia Music via Bluetooth connection on the stereo (very stable BT compared to HTC Android)) - Stable hotspot connection (creates a very stable local WIFI compared to HTC Android) - Live tiles - Standard charging cables (can use the same cable for multiple devices) 3) Neat little functions - Song recognition - Visual voice mail 4) Sufficient: - App store - Media transfer 5) Bad: - No wireless offline sync for Outlook (only via skydrive or 3rd party product) - Notes are saved to Skydrive without user consent - No Micro SD card - No texting from PC - No HDMI or video output (only DLNA, which most TVs don't have yet) - Playlist management - Only one volume setting for ring tone and everything else Here is why: 1) Really great: - Offline GPS: Nokia Lumias are the only phones with real (offline) GPS and free worldwide maps. All other phones (iPhone, Samsung) only have ""online GPS"" - meaning they require an Internet connection. Lumia connects directly to satellite, just like a Garmin (instead o cell towers like other phones). Why is that important to me? I travel frequently to foreign countries where data charges are insane. For calls and texts I buy cheap pre-paid local SIM cards and use an old unlocked phone. I can still use my Lumia GPS though because it works without a SIM card or internet connection. Just like a Garmin it also shows information about nearby restaurants, shopping and points of interest. 2) Pretty good: - Physical button for camera & video: My phone has become my main picture taking & video recording device. The Nokia Lumia has a physical camera button that I very much appreciate. I can grab my phone, press the button at the side and the camera is ready to shoot. The physical button just works faster for me and it also seems to be easier to explain ""press here"" to some stranger who I ask to take a photo of me with my camera. The phone really takes great low-light pictures. I can take pictures w/o disturbing everyone with a flash. The Lumia does need better zoom capabilities though. It gets kind of blurry when I zoom in. I do regret that I didn't wait for the 42MP Lumia that will come out later this year. - Build and quality: That's where Nokia traditionally shines. There are several videos on YouTube that show how indestructible this phone is. I haven't tried it but apparently you can use it to hammer in a nail (with the screen side), drop it or drive a car over it and it still works. There is no need to buy a protective case for this one. The color goes ""all through"" the polycarbonate body (I'm sure there is a better technical term for that). It's not just a layer on the surface. So if it does get scratched (which is pretty difficult to do) then those scratches are hardly visible. Yes, the phone could be a little lighter but that doesn't bother me too much. Even though I'm a ""business kind of person"" I decided to go with a yellow one. A splash of color looks great with my otherwise mostly neutral business clothes and devices. Screen is awesome and very sensitive to touch. - Voice recognition: It's fairly standard for modern smart phones that you can dictate text instead of typing it. I happen to have a German accent though and most voice recognition softwares can't deal with that. The Nokia Lumia gets 99% of what I'm saying right. I've never had such an easy time dictating before. - Playing Nokia Music via Bluetooth on the stereo speakers: With the Lumia 920 you get free music mixes from Nokia. I don't have the time to build a music collection and put playlists together. So I'm always lacking nice background music when we have guests or when we're just sitting out on the deck on a nice summer evening. We bought a cheap Bluetooth receiver to plug into our stereo so that we can select and play music right from our phone. Setup was just plug and play. We tried the same with my husbands iPhone 3 and Android HTC Inspire but the music came out very choppy. The Lumia has a much more stable connection and great sound. I just pick a music mix from Nokia music that fits the mood or I pick individual songs from my collection. Our speakers are in the living room but I can change the music from my phone when I'm in the kitchen or the deck outside. - Stable hotspot connection: The Lumia works very well as a hotspot. It connects my laptop wirelessly to the Internet when I travel. Most smartphones can do this but the connection through the Lumia is really good compared with my husband's HTC Inspire. - Live tiles: The tiles are much more than just shortcuts to apps. You can pin about everything to the start screen: music mixes, stock prices, photos, videos, websites, contacts and apps of course. I especially love the tiles for stock positions that I hold. I can just glance at my phone to see the latest stock price w/o having to open an app. Then there are those things that I use often: ""people tiles"" for my husband and best friend to tap on and call, shortcuts to websites, apps like an egg-timer, the latest CNN news headlines etc. Then I have a tile with rotating wedding pictures(just because they make me happy when I glance at them during the day). It's highly customizable. - Standard charging cables: I have a habit of forgetting my phone charging cable whenever I travel somewhere. In the past I've spend a lot of money on replacement cables because my phone required a model & manufacturer specific cable. The Lumia 920 uses a standard mini USB cable and power plug for charging. They are dirt cheap on Amazon and many other devices use the same cable. I can now use the same cable for my Kindle, my phone and my Android tablet. That cuts down on replacement cost and the number of cables that I have to carry around when I travel. 3) Some neat little functions: - Song recognition: The Lumia recognizes music for me. Ever hear that great song on the radio or TV and want to know what it is? With 2 tabs on the Lumia the device starts ""listening for music"". It then searches for the song in Xbox Music and shows me the title and artist. - Visual voice mail: Voice messages are listed on the phone with the name of caller and time of call. I like that I can delete them without going into my voice mail system. I don't even have to listen to them. 4) Sufficient: - App store: I can get all the major apps that I need in the Windows App store. Unfortunately some online services (banks, online trading platforms etc) only offer Android and iOS versions of their apps. As long as they have a good generic mobile website that's not a problem since you can just pin the mobile website to your start screen and that is (almost) as good as an app. A few of the services I use have no mobile websites though. - Media transfer: When the Lumia is connected to a PC via USB then it shows up as an additional drive in the Windows explorer. You can move or copy from/to the drive just like to any other drive. Unfortunately it doesn't work over Bluetooth but it's sufficient for me (mostly I use it for moving photos to my PC and for copying the occasional Word/Excel document to my phone. I can review it then while I'm sitting on a plane). 5) Bad (some of it will hopefully be fixed with the upcoming Nokia Amber and Windows Blue updates): - No wireless offline sync for Outlook: With my old Nokia Symbian I was able to just sync my Outlook contacts and calendar via Bluetooth between my phone and PC. Unfortunately Microsoft followed the now popular ""cloud"" concept and everything needs to be stored on Skydrive to work. You can sync between PC and Skydrive and you can sync between phone and Skydrive. There is no direct sync between phone and PC without the Skydrive though. That concept has some advantages and many people like it that way. I'm not one of them. I do not want to have my personal data in the almighty cloud. I follow the principle of putting nothing on the Internet unless I'm ok with the whole wide world seeing it. I doubt that the FBI is interested in my calendar entries but it still bothers me that the ""cloud"" can be accessed by such organizations without a warrant. I want my personal data physically under my control and it really irks me that I'm not given the option. I worked around it by installing a 3rd party program (""Akruto Sync"") that lets me sync my Outlook data over a WIFI network. It only works while I'm on my home network but so far that's been sufficient for me (it does have an Internet sync option but it's not easy to set up). - Notes are automatically saved to sky drive without the user's consent: I use Windows OneNote extensively on my PC so I was thrilled when it came pre-installed on my Lumia. Unfortunately notes are automatically saved to the sky drive, without the user even being aware of it. There is no setting to prevent that. That left me wondering what else is being transferred without my knowledge. After the initial setup I changed the password for my Microsoft account to some nonsense on my phone. That way the phone can't save anything to the Skydrive without my knowledge. There are plenty of nice free note apps in the Windows store and I installed one that I'm using instead. I wish I would be able to sync my notes to my PC though. - No Micro SD card: 32 Gig are more than sufficient for most of what I do on my phone. However, I would like to have the option to extend if I ever need it. So far I've eventually run out of space on every device I ever had. Some great app might come out in the future that needs more space. - No texting from my computer: As a former Nokia Symbian user I've gotten used to reading, writing and sending text messages from my PC.. I miss this with the Nokia Lumia. The excellent ""speech to text"" function does make composing texts on the phone faster now though. - No HDMI or video output: Nokia uses the DLNA standard that most manufactures (except for Apple) agreed to for connecting devices on WIFI. In the future most TVs will probably be connected to a home network and to the internet. You can then play videos from your phone wirelessly via WIFI to your TV. However, for the time being most TVs are not connected to a net yet. It would be nice to still have an HDMI connector or video output on the phone so that I can play videos to the TV from there (or show photos). Even my old Symbian N97 had that. Until we get a new TV I have to transfer everything to my laptop and play it from there. - The music playlist management is simply horrible: You can create playlist on your PC and transfer them to the Lumia. You also can create playlists directly on the phone but once they are created there is no way to edit them anymore. This seems so basic that I hope it will be addressed in the next update. - Only one volume selection for everything: The Lumia doesn't let you regulate the volume for the ring tone separately from the volume for everything else (video, music, speech). That can get really annoying in certain situations. There have been so many user complaints about that though, that I'm hopeful it's going to be addressed in the next firmware update. There are a ton of other functions on the Lumia that I don't use so I'll stop here. Overall I don't think you'll find much missing on the Lumia and you'll get a solid, high quality smartphone.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

The camera is stellar, it takes great 1080p video, and it can focus and take pictures in low-light. The auto-focus is fast. The only thing not improved over the HTC Titan is that the front-facing camera is still only 1.2mp. The call quality is greatly improved - as there was a serious issue with the first batch of HTC Titans having extremely poor call quality. People are now telling me that they can hear me a lot better than before. The LTE data speeds are phenomenal. The phone itself is faster and moves through applications a lot quicker. I like the feel of the phone, it rests better in my hand because of the curved back. It feels slightly heavier, but not that much compared to the HTC Titan. The screen is gorgeous and it is quite viewable in direct sunlight. I am extremely impressed because now I can take a picture is the sunny outdoors and not struggle to view the screen. I like the yellow color - as I can now find it in my purse..lol. It's a pretty, bright color. I was tiring of the black phones I've had. The glossy shell does not feel slippery to me, like some people have mentioned. The overall build quality feels and looks quite solid. What I especially like about this phone is that it is a Nokia phone. They listen to their customers and are providing updates and fixes to their phones. HTC never sent out an update the entire two years I had it.

The camera is slow and the pictures are often blown out or there's just bad color contrast. It's also slow to take a picture. You have to press the shutter button and wait a half a second or else you'll have blurry pictures. Data connection also seems lame. Whether it's connected to tmobile LTE 4G or wifi, it just gets stuck sometimes and claims no connection. Super annoying. Lastly, about once a day the phone just freezes for 10 seconds or so.

This is my first smart phone on a contract; from a basic phone paid month to month, to this. It was very easy to learn, and customizable. Things I didnt like: All of your apps except music are all in an alphabetical list if you swipe to the left. In Android and IOS, you can drag and drop icons and folders to group things. In Windows Phone 8, its all just there. You can pin apps to your main screen, but it can get cluttered if you have too many there. Ive got just enough to not have to scroll down at all. If you add something like facebook or hotmail, all of your friends information will be imported into your ""People"" tile. This is your address book. I removed facebook on here for that reason, I dont want 200 phone numbers in there when I only talk to a few people. The contract can be expensive, Ive got 500 mb a month plan and its 99.70 a month. I barely use 100 mbs, but some people will used more ----------------------- --Things I like: Camera is good, I think. The most advanced camera Id used before this was the iPod touch 4. Compared to that, this is like HD. Battery is AWESOME. I can make it 2 days with use throughout the days, before hitting 0. On constant battery saver mode, I can make it 3 - 4 days. Battery saver with music on at all times will drain it in about 24 - 32 hours. You can sync all of your microsoft accounts, like hotmail, skydrive, xbox live; all that, to your phone and check updates for those on here. All of the pictures you take are auto uploaded to your skydrive. Its got nice, comfortable edges. Not super rounded like samsung, and not rigid like a brick. I like how almost the whole front face is the screen; makes you feel like youre in the future. There is a bing search button built into the screen, next to the windows button. Sometimes it might get in the way, but its nice when you hear a song and youre thinking, ""Ive heard this, what is it?"" You can run your search and click on the music note, and it listens to tell you. Its been so far accurate with what ive tested it on. This is a Nokia so it comes preloaded with their apps. Nokia Drive is like a GPS, preloaded with 4GB of the USA maps.

A lot of headphones with built-in mic don't work. Volume sometimes works only for music and not for phone ringtone, and vise versa. Still no Apps. LTE works like crap on AT&T, and I only had 9Mbs down while my friends iPhone 5 on AT&T same LTE was getting close to 22MBs!!! Nokia maps and Bing integration just blows more than Apple's Maps fiasco. I searched for a club that was 2 blocks away from me, the phone found another club, 5 miles away with different name. For a smartphone, it's quite dumb. Micro USB cable charges fast only if you use the one that came with the phone, which is BS. Typing is not faster than iPhone and way behind than Android Jelly Bean keyboard. Voice commands sound more like a gimmick and had no real use for me, maybe for someone who's blind or disabled, even then it doesn't understand what you tell the phone to do.

1455,B00A2V7BA4,Yenzer,5,7-Jan-13,False,Best Smartphone on the market!,"The 920 is the pinnacle of 2 years of refinement that has seen the Windows Phone platform go from shaky endeavor to savvy upstart. While it is not the most popular mobile OS on the market, it is easily the best of all worlds. It bridges a slick and decidely different (in a time when Google and Apple just trade blows and mimic each other)style with app reliability and confidence. - You get the stability and reliability you find with Apple's ecosystem (albeit without the walled-garden approach Cupertino uses to keep a draconian grip on it's developers) without the fear of viruses and malware that can come from the Wild-West-like development environment of Android. - You also get a device that is designed to work in tandem with products and services you use daily (Office, Skype, Social Networks). - Also, make sure to utilize the Groups and Rooms features to communicate with multiple people in your life simultaneously. Windows Phone 8 is the culmination of all of the style and ingenuity that you can ask for, while offering features/services as baked-in aspects. You will quickly find that, while the Microsoft Store is only 150k (more everyday) apps, nearly everything you want is either already a built-in feature or quickly on the way. If you are invested in the Windows ecosystem (Xbox 360, Windows 7/8, Office, etc), then you are doing yourself a disservice by not bridging these devices as they are intended. The Windows Phone 8 platform is there for you as a mobile gateway to all of those products and services. Pick up an Xbox Music Pass for $10/mo to have your playlists and music with you, and also enjoy all the ad-free music you want, regardless of where you happen to be. Ignore the haters, find a handset, and give the platform a test drive. Before you do, head over to youtube and watch a couple videos that highlight different features, so that you know how to operate the phone without the aide of presumably biased floor associates. You will not be sorry that you did. Stop mulling over these damn reviews (especially critics that cannot remove the decade and a half of Anti-Windows stigma from their assessments of current products) and get out there, put hands on the product, and find out for yourself.

I really like the Nokia specific apps like Nokia Drive (offline navigation worldwide for free) and city lense. The only really annoying thing is the still long delivery time since Nokia seems to have overwhelmed by the demand or to have production problems. App selection is fine for me, but others might miss the 10,0000th fart app so they should better stick with Android or Apple.

I researched it for 2 weeks prior to getting it, and the thing that worried me most was the reviews on the battery. On the first day I had it, it lasted 6 hours, which I expected, due to it being in the box for who knows how long. I charged it, after letting it go completely dead and got a good 16 hours out of it the next day. The third day 24 hours, and today I have 72% battery life with having charged it 15 hours ago. I have been streaming music and surfing the internet. I chose this phone over the iphone. UPDATE: Had this phone for maybe 6 months, took amazing care of it, as I do all phones I own. This phone dropped twice, both times were just from a couple feet. The first time it dropped I had to do a soft reset to get it to come back. The second time it dropped, the phone stopped working. I know, I know, I dropped it, my fault, yes, I get it, however, to have two minor drops and stop working is complete garbage in my book! Also, the battery was pretty decent the first month, but by the time of the phone's demise, I was having to charge it twice a day, and I rarely talk on this phone. I now regret choosing this phone over the iphone. I know a lot of people who have put their iphones through the ringer and their phones look gnarly, but they are still working. 2nd Update, I'm changing my stars to 4, the battery in my first phone was the real problem and att's warranty department took care of it. When I did a hard reset of my phone, the battery got so hot and it melted the sim card and that is what caused the phone to die. I'm on my new phone now and the battery works just fine. I also have a case for this phone.

1797,B00A7F57EM,jambandfreak,4,7-Jan-13,False,great phone for the price.,This is a great phone so far. I thought I ordered the black model but they sent it in white. I came from palm pre 2 and so far I love the Lumia. I didn't want an iphone I think they're overrated and clunky. Ive seen my sister in laws with the case on it its like half the size of my kindle. I don't carry a purse and don't want to but with something that big it wouldn't fit comfortably in my pocket. Ive had a droid x too I wasn't impressed with call quality with some calls being echoed. It also didn't have a vibrate option for all alerts which was a turn off here. I was tired of the short battery life of my pre 2 so thats already a step up Id say its average as someone else put it but still one day more than I got out of my old phone. The crisp features of the Lumia are great and receiving and or editing MS docs is a no brainer. The music option is great as you can add your favorites to your desktop. Tune in radio and Pandora are already installed. GREAT for me I'm a music person. I noticed you have to shut it down when it doesn't react like it should. Ive had to once in two weeks so no biggie. One thing I did which I think is a great idea is that for $5-6 you can buy a small case for the phone since it has a slick feel to it you might not hold onto it easily. Ive dropped mine a couple times and it hasn't cracked the screen as someone else said. Its still nice and slim too. The bigger screen is a plus from the pre2 but no real keyboard its all about touch with the Lumia. Id given it 5 stars if it had better battery life. I'm not a big gamer but I see the xbox option on the home screen and I'm sure any of the apps not updated will be soon. It was free to me with a Verizon upgrade so that's great too.

1484,B00A2V7BA4,Jim,5,7-Jan-13,False,Best of the Best,"Don't let the price point fool you. I would have paid 2-3x what this phone retails for with a new contract. Lumia 920 brings a user experience maturity exceeding the iPhone, the platform experience (think security, stability) of modern versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 7), with a price-point that would enable you to buy several Lumia 920's for the price of one comparable iPhone or advanced Android device. Among other Windows Phone devices, the next nearest competitor is the HTC 8X. While free (with contract) versions of the HTC 8X can be found, (representing a pretty amazing deal), the Lumia 920 has 4x the storage, and a lot of additional features to offer, including advanced camera and exclusive gps software functionality. My wife also upgraded to a Lumia 920 from a droid at the same time, and a month or so in, is still remarking over how everything not only just works, it's easier to use, and works without the malware concerns, the bugs, and the poor integration / quality issues of the droid. For both of us, our Lumia 920's are the only electronic device we carry, and it serves more than adequately as a phone, camera, gps, messaging, browser, music/video player (Xbox music), portable game console (Xbox), kindle book reader, and more.

Heres my updated review Pros: - LONG!!! battery life - The smaller profile makes talking on it or pocketing it very nice - This may be personal, it's my favorite phone to use headphones to talk with - LONG!!! battery - Small touches to the camera software are interesting* - The game snake, paired with nostalgia topped with public stares - Headphone jack - The recording software records calls if you need that - Surprisingly has blue tooth, I only say that because would you expect it to? Cons: - a T9 keyboard makes typing crawl - No 4G LTE (2g, 3g only) - Incredibly poor Internet experience - No GPS - No wifi - Poor picture quality (I still like them lol) - No whats app - A nearly non existent app store - MSRP price point a bit high at $60 - Definitely won't replace your smart phone Other notes: Things like CNN, You tube, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Yahoo mail and etc have there own feature phone website. I've ordered through amazon on it, and it was fine, and a little annoying. This WILL NOT replace your smart phone, it's a nice secondary though. ORIGINAL POST BELOW: If you need e-mail, FAST texting, HIGH speed internet, traditional apps, GPS, a good camera, Wi-Fi, 4g LTE or anything similar, this is not the phone for you. For most this is not going to be your primary phone. Now that we are past that I’ve seen some misinformation in the reviews. Below are my responses to the incorrect information I’ve seen. *The review photo shows the location of the quick settings button.* - The volume can be quickly adjusted with a single key press. Use the quick settings key and it can be adjusted quickly. Some folks have stated they must go through the settings menu which is inaccurate. - The phone does have predictive text. Just as the volume above simply hold down the quick settings key. It is right there. You can also turn this on from the text message menu. A review stated that it was unavailable. - The phone does have silent. Simply push the quick settings key. You will find the option to silence the phone. A couple reviews said the opposite. - You must use the correct SIM card size which is a micro SIM card. Do not attempt to use a nano SIM card. I’ve seen that cell phone stores installed the nano sim and blamed the phone for not working. - You need to check with your carrier to ensure you’ll will have the network you need for the phone. Alternatively you can use Open Signal to verify 2g/3g in your area. - The T9 texting is definitely a learning curve. The first letter of your sentence will capitalize automatically. (a review said it didn’t) Simply push the quick settings button during your text. You can switch from lower case, all caps, first letter caps and numbers. - The manual indicates that a double SIM card version and a single SIM card version exists. HOWEVER Amazon and other sellers are not clear at all to which one they sell. Nokia hasn’t been clear on how to tell which one is it either. (The phone I bought directly from Amazon was a single SIM card) I recommend you fully read the manual from the Nokia website. I took 10 mins to do that and it made a world of difference. This phone is for: Evening phone Something to take to places high risk to your smart phone (water park, festivals) Social media/digital cleanse Very young children or senior citizens that have trouble with smart phones Emergency phone A spare phone when your smart phone battery runs out I’m using this to take a break from social media and the news. I also use my iPhone 6s Plus still and that will not change. There are many more positives and negatives to this phone. I have purposely chose to not include that in my review. I wanted to focus more on inaccuracies and uses.

If your a social person, your defiantly going to love windows phone 8. It is constantly updating your personalized information on the home screen. No other OS can do this, it literally moves and reacts depending on what is going on. My only complaint is a shortage of a few apps. (Cough) Instagram (cough). But that's not a huge deal, you'll get over it. The Phone itself is outstanding. It defiantly will take a heavy punch to break this thing. The screen still has no scratches, even though I dropped it multiple times. Its also ultra sensitive, so you wont have to take your gloves off to use it. It may be a little on the heavy side, but that's mainly because the backs not made of glass (Iphone). Did I mention its the world's best Screen on a phone? The camera on this baby is unreal. First off, the lens is floating, meaning if you shake your hands a lot (We all do, right? ;) the video shows up still and non-bouncing around. You can also take a picture in near total dark, without flash, and have it show up as if it was taken in a well-lit room. Hence, the Lumia 920 has the best camera on a mobile phone to date. Remember paying $1.30 for a single song on ITunes? Yeah, well those days are over. Xbox music allows you to stream unlimited music for free, and all songs YOU chosen to put in YOUR playlist. No cash involved, at all. Just an Add here and there, which I'm sure you can handle. I could go on and on about this phone, but I know you have a busy life, so I wont. What you just read are a few of my favorite features on the phone. There's many more that I want YOU to experience for yourself. Trust me, this phone is great. There's honestly nothing, except instagram not being there, that I dislike about the phone. It truly is a hammer, and I guarantee you will Love it. Thanks for reading!

15308,B075FL4H89,Ivan Cross,2,7-Aug-18,True,"Nokia I hope you read this, I really wanted to like this phone!","I've been using the Nokia 5310 expressmusic since 2010 or earlier. I really like this phone but they stopped making it a long time ago, it's getting harder to find and I was excited to try this 3310 reissue. I'm a big fan of Nokia, non-smart, bar-style phones with 0 through 9 buttons rather than a touch screen. First I'll say what I liked about the 3310 reissue. The music player works well. Easy to use and sounds good with or without headphones. I liked that it has a flashlight. It's an attractive phone. I got it in yellow and It was appealing. Here's what I did not like. It did not have T-9 predictive text. I've become accustomed to that and it's really easy to use. It's possible to text very fast with T-9 once you get the hang of it. For those who don't know what T-9 predictive text is, it means rather than push each number the amount of times to correspond to the letter you want (example push 7 four times for S), you just push the number once and the phone guesses the word. If it's not the right word you push * for more choices. It works great. I would of been willing to put up with that, if the calendar wasn't so limited. Here's what I mean: I put in one month worth of my schedule, and then the phone would not allow me to put anything else in. I never ran into this problem with the 5310. I get my work schedule 2 months at a time, and I have other things I need to keep track of as well. I rely on my phone for this. I'd much rather Nokia get rid of all the games that I'll never use, and give me an unlimited calendar. I returned this phone within 12 hrs of delivery. I took the time to write this review, because I'd like Nokia to fix these problems. If they did I'd buy this phone again. Or let me know if they have a similar phone with the features I need.

2217,B00CQAODG4,ashley frankenfield,5,7-Aug-13,True,"Smooth, fast, excellent","Three ways the phone excels: - Fast OS / hardware / apps - Excellent camera - Nokia Here Apps suite (Also, wireless charging is an excellent feature.) 1) The OS is silky smooth to use and is amply powered on this phone - the specs do not match the best Android phones, but they are more than enough to run the OS and the apps quickly. There is no lag. Every app runs and opens quickly. Shoot, nearly all of the apps look absolutely gorgeous on this screen. I have played a few games on this (Mass Effect: Infilitrator and Halo: Spartan Assault) and both games load really quickly and run well on the phone, although extensive high graphics gaming will drain the battery. Super fun games, by the way. 2) The camera is just so so good. Video, photo, low light, high light, all good. It's only - only - weakness is if you're near a bright window, it always tends to make the subject dark. But, for the advanced photographer, it includes controls of Exposure, ISO, and white balance, as well as the typical ""scenes"" presets. With this you can overcome those problems. The flash is good too, but I normally choose to see the low-light power excel than use the flash. Add in Nokia's Photobeam, which lets you connect a slideshow of your phone's photos to any web browser on any screen, and it's a great photo suite. I haven't even touched Nokia's many Lens apps: burst shots, panorama app, etc. 3) Nokia is awesome. Especially Here apps. Here Drive is their built in Turn-by-Turn voice navigation with OFFLINE function! So useful. Here Maps is just a plain good maps app, and if you want your direction in a viewable list, you use this. Here City Lens is a really cool app which lets you find stuff near you by just raising the camera, and it will list all local stuff in that direction. So. Nifty. The phone does all normal tasks super well, and it's special features just boost the quality of the phone. Nothing lacking here, I'd recommend anyone get it.

2356,B00CQAODG4,Soner Bicici,5,7-Aug-13,False,Thinking about buying Lumia 928? Let's see if I can convince you,"Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you. First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps! As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S. My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S. Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review. Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier. Here are the pros: - Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808. - Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time. - Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can. - Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy! - Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free. - Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home. - Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers. - Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen. - Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most. - Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus. - Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too. Now time for the Cons: - As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness. - No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card slot so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage. - Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it. - Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no ""x"" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps. - Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not. Conclusion: I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try.

Music app crashes if you try to send a text!,"I thought since it had as much RAM as my old iPhone 6 that it'd be fine even though people say it's not much RAM these days, but THIS PHONE CANNOT MULTITASK AT ALL. As in, you try to play music (with the default Google Play Music app) and send a text, half the time the music app quits when you do so. 100% of the time it quits when you try to take a photo. It is a worthless piece of junk. The music app will also just quit on its own probably once an hour or so from I guess running out of RAM?!

15489,B075FLG6MV,Amazon Customer,5,7-Apr-18,True,Perfect Entry Level Smartphone for Seniors and Young Teens,"For $100.00 in 2018, I think this is the budget phone to beat. Let me emphasize, this is a entry level smartphone, but the build quality is great. I have a OnePlus 5 myself and was very surprised how well the Nokia 2 compared when I unboxed it. I bought two of these for my parents at Christmas and they've had no issues with them running on T-Mobile. My daughter's hand-me-down Nexus 5 recently tanked and I just can't see spending much more than this on a phone for a teen. To me, excellent battery life and continued updates is more important than a little extra ram or faster processor. I considered the Amazon Moto e4 or e4 Plus, but those are towards the end of their life cycle and are never going to see Android 8.0. The Nokia 2 is at least slated to receive 8.1. Pros: - Cost - Great screen picture (no its not AMOLED etc... but were talking $100 phone here) - Very good call quality on T-Mobile, have yet to setup daughters phone on AT&T but will update once done - Large batttery - Dual Sim - Expandable Memory - Vanilla Android, not heavily skinned - Update to at least Android 8.1 Cons: - Sluggish Performance - Built in 8gb memory is over 1/2 gone as soon as you start up the phone - OK camera",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 2 - Android - 8GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5"" Screen - Black - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B075FLG6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-rum+PvIL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FLG6MV,359,194.97,0.0

2498,B00E45043A,MWebb,5,7-Apr-14,True,Uh oh its CARRIER LOCKED what do I do with it!,"If you made the mistake of purchasing this phone thinking to use it overseas, or on TMobile over here, and just discovered it is ""locked"" to AT&T (even though you own it and thought ""no contract"" meant ""unlocked""), there are still a lot of useful things to do with, apart from fuming: 1. Out of the box, insert battery, power it up, and go to Settings. 2. Set ""Airplane Mode"". 3. Power off, remove battery, insert the provided GoPhone SIM. - The SIM is essential for downloading Nokia Here Maps, which are GREAT. 4. Go to Settings, turn on WiFi mode. Don't turn off Airplane Mode! Leave it the way you set it in step 2. - Airplane Mode keeps the phone from searching for a cellular carrier and forcing you to activate the phone. 5. There are some advantages to having a Microsoft Outlook free email account. Go to outlook <dot> com and get a free account if you don't already have one. 6. Go to Settings and add some Accounts: - Microsoft (your new or existing Outlook account). - Nokia (for free and purchased apps from the Store). - Google, FaceBook, Yahoo! Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, IBM Notes Traveler, and generic POP and IMAP accounts are your other choices. 7. While in Settings use the ""left arrow"" a permanent below-the-screen left arrow to move back to the main Settings menu and set Brightness to High with no automatic control. This works best except in dim settings like on an airplane with lights out, where I use Low for Kindle reading. 8. On the same first page of Settings, scroll down to Phone Update and check for system updates. You should already have the ""Black"" update set, 8.1 will come out in a couple of months. Check about once a week. 9. Apps will update too, a number will appear on the Live Tile for Store. Sometimes important updates like FaceBook are announced but the Store won't auto update right away - you can force an update by searching for that app, then clicking on it, and clicking manually on the update bar that appears. 10. Download these apps (my favorites, YMMV): - WhatsApp, Line, Viber. Or your favorite message/free phone call solution. - Most of these require an active phone number to work. If you use your other phone's number, that will erase your account on that other phone, when you use the text supplied PIN to activate on the Lumia 520. That might change someday, but for now linkage to phone numbers is a limitation. - Skype. Works REALLY well on the Lumia 520. - Kindle. Works so-so. I read a couple of books inflight so it isn't screen sharpness that is the problem. The problem is a little Amazon software funkiness that occasionally cuts off a line or two of text between pages. To fix, rotate from book orientation to landscape to read your text then rotate back. The rotation seems to fix the problem. - Facebook. Fine for consumption, not so fine for editing your posts or comments. Much improved over last year. - Facebook MESSENGER. Yes, it is a separate app, and more and more people use it, is a good substitutes for WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and Facebook doesn't care how many devices you have it on. A mature product on Lumia 520. Be sure to pay attention to the little delta wing that rats out your location - default is on, so you WILL be tracked by friends and frenemies. Well tracked when you answer a message. 11. From the home screen - press the Home soft button on the bottom of the screen - flick the screen to the left to see the list of apps, all the apps, and open HERE Maps. - Choose your state and download your map. - Going to Dublin? etc? download that map. The maps don't take up a lot of space. - Yes, GPS works without cellular service, so long as you downloaded the map. Remember, the maps won't download if you didn't put your SIM card in (you can remove it later, but why bother?). 12. Some good exercise apps that work well with the LOUD speaker on this tiny phone: - 7 Minute Scientific. - Tabatas. 13. For music: - Because it has the necessary licenses from MicroSoft, 64gb and even 128gb micro SD's fit and work fine. I use a 64gb to hold almost all my music. - It will play current iTunes tracks fine (everything except the early DRM digital rights management copy protected tunes), mp3. it will not play Ogg Vorbis. - The player is called Music & Videos and comes stock; until updates, it might appear as Nokia Music or as xBox, Nokia Mix Radio is a separate app which provides free streaming music from Nokia. Very cool! REMEMBER, all this is WITHOUT cellular phone service! You have a camera, music player, GPS unit, e-reader, and minimalist web browser, all in a $60 or so package! And the option of using it to back up your AT&T and AT&T driven phone service, if you need it. SHORTCOMINGS: 1. Due to the 512mb memory limitation, app switching is painfully slow. NOT unusably slow, but by modern standards PITA slow. 2. A few games and rare apps won't run in a 512mb footprint. Before you go ballistic on this memory limitation, keep in mind the iPad 2 and original Mini are both 512mb. Like Apple, though, MicroSoft uses compiled code for its apps - more efficient - than Android, which ""compiles code"" on the fly via an interpreter - hence Android needs faster processors and more RAM (but in current editions and with modern hardware, Android is plenty fast). 3. This is DVD resolution, not HD. It is 800x480, not one of the higher resolutions. The type looks crisp, not pixelated, but you don't get as much information per screen on websites or Kindle, and the screen - for resolution AND quality reasons - isn't good for serious video watching. 4. No front camera. This is a BIGGIE for many selfie fans. On the rear, no FLASH but the camera DOES autofocus. I don't like flash, I prefer natural light even if the picture goes grainy etc. so I'm ok with this. UNEXPECTED SURPRISE: 1. The battery life is absolutely incredible, with cellular radio turned off via the Airplane Mode switch. 2. Nokia continues to roll out major software updates for this amazing little helper - even Win Phone 8.1 is coming to the 520, which means being able to run apps from the uSD card and, finally, being able to set ringer and music volumes separately (saves ears, that). So I've found plenty of uses for my Lumia 520, even if it isn't good for travel or TMob. I wish it were unlocked, and would have paid more for an unlocked one from Nokia (if they sold unlocked phones direct, like Google and Motorola and Apple do), but my buyer's mistake hasn't turned into buyer's remorse.

2390,B00CQAODG4,SH,2,7-Apr-14,False,Get a galaxy or an iPhone.,"I got a Lumia 928 back in September 2013, so this is written at about 7 months of use. I know that Nokia phones had a reputation of being indestructible, but I guess this is an exception. A few months ago I started running into annoying issues that are only getting worse every day. Pros: -Great camera that takes high quality pictures -Nice big screen -The phone displays a list of predicted words while texting, which is useful Cons: -Hardware and software issues. Camera only works sometimes - hard/soft reset do not solve it. The solution I found online is to apply pressure to the phone, which fixes it SOMETIMES. -The big feature of having a Xenon flash is eclipsed by the flash only working occasionally. -Lock button does not work sometimes -Phone gets caught in loops and behaves randomly when some apps are selected -Touchscreen is unresponsive a lot of the time -The backlights of the three face ""buttons"" are yellow and have dark spots that ruin the appearance. A common issue. -NO APPS. There are some useful apps you can find, but if you are looking for the latest trending apps and most popular apps (like flappy bird, instagram..) you're out of luck. You will have to deal with a buggy version that's on the market, because the official apps aren't available. Kind of makes you feel left out when Apple and Android have so many apps you are left out of. My phone probably has some of these hardware issues because I dropped it once or twice. I have a case and screen protector though, and everyone drops their phone once in a while. I have dropped my previous phone, an iPhone 4, many times to the point where the screen was shattered - but it still worked.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

2340,B00CQAODG4,Damien,5,6-Sep-13,True,The LASER Phone has arrived!,"OK, so the early production code name for this phone was the Verizon Laser. Too bad they didn't stick with ; ) it but I can understand why. This is the perfect business phone. The good (not necessarily in order of importance): 1) Windows UI: So much better than android and iOS in my opinion. I upgraded from an iphone 4 which was also an awesome device, but the usability of the Windows Phone OS is so much better, fluid, and easier to manage. iOS just seemed clunky to use in my opinion, even after over a year of heavy use. The Windows phone OS is really a mix of iOS and Android, easier to use than Android but offers more flexibility than iOS. 2) Skydrive: Not perfect yet but very awesome none the less. I'm using the Windows 8.1 preview on my tablet/laptop and Skydrive is integrated now into your document libraries. Auto upload of photos and documents from the phone are available through explorer in Windows 8 and vice versa. It's also handy to have skydrive available from a web browser. No more dropbox for me! It works very well and there was no setup required with the exception of having a Microsoft account. 3) Nokia Exclusive Apps: Not enough is said about Nokia's app lineup. Photobeamer, the camera app, the augmented reality apps, all very cool and useful. Their GPS navigation app works very well and is fun to use. 4) The camera: Top notch awesome photos, good zoom, easily the best camera I have played with on a phone. Night time photos look awesome as well thanks to the fancy flash. 5) Office: Out of the box editing word, powerpoint, and excel on the go! Sure, you aren't going to build a whole business presentation on a phone, but making quick edits is very handy. The email app is far superior to android and ios for my business use. 6) Hardware: Very high quality! The screen is top notch, very vivid colors and deep blacks. Videos look amazing. The 928 can hold its own up to a Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. The buttons are well placed, the speaker is loud and clear. Calls are much clearer than my iPhone was. I really like the placement of all buttons on the phone as well. Good spacing and easy to access. I'll also note that it went flying out of my hand screen down into a gravel parking lot. After letting out a loud sissy squeak, I was relieved to find no visible scratches on the screen. Very impressive. With that in mind, cases for this device are pretty limited for now as well as the screen protectors. 7) XBOX Live: True they don't have the selection of games that Android or iOS does, but the integration of your XBOX live account is very well done and fun to use. NBA Jam is really fun and the controls/touchscreen work great. 8) I could go on about more little things I love about this phone but will cut it short. This is the only Windows Phone you should consider in my opinion. If you are an app fanatic, the Windows OS may not be a good choice yet as they grow the app store. I will say the apps they do have are high quality. For business use, the Nokia with Windows is the clear choice. I may be a little biased towards Windows as an admin, but also enjoy and respect Apple and Google's interfaces as well. The Bad: 1) I really don't have any complaints yet after a month of use. A couple freeze ups (thankfully no blue screens!) easily fixed by a reboot. If you are considering this phone, GET IT. You will be satisfied.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

My initial high hopes three weeks ago are now replaced most days trying to decide whether I should try to stick it out or cut my losses and get an Android or iPhone. I love the look of Windows Phone's UI and the integration of your photos and contacts into almost every corner of the OS is somewhat charming. That being said the gimped Windows 7 apps (Spotify) and complete lack of some of the most popular apps from the marketplace (Pandora) make me miss the days of my iPhone 4 and even my 1st gen Android. Technically the phone lags, and the apps often crash. APN settings will work one minute then stop the next, forcing you to reset the phone. The camera on the Lumia 900 is fantastic, sadly you will be hard pressed to find a quality photo editing app in the marketplace.

20712,B07HD3QC65,Hallam W. Gibson,1,6-Oct-19,True,Nokia durability and quality is questionable 😠😠😠,"Got this phone in February 2019 , by April, I noticed I had difficulty in charging this device!

Before I had a Moto G6 Play and I had return it. On Moto, I couldn't receive calls over wifi. I'm using the phone with the ""Textnow app + wifi"". With Moto the phone would not answer the calls when the screen was OFF. My kids use Samsung and iPhone and they work perfectly well in that setup. Nokia 7.1 works perfectly well as well, no missing calls on wifi + Textnow. The only weak point in my opinion is it's small battery capacity, I wouldn't mind paying extra for larger 5000 or 4000mA battery. In addition, the phone will not display battery percentage number on the screen. I think they should include this option or replace the ""icon"" battery with a percentage number. When phone is charging there is only a charging icon showing (no number percentage); one needs to press the power button to see the percentage charged. In addition Nokia indicates this is stock ""android one"". It is not. Under setting --> battery there is missing icon/menu to enable battery percentage, in addition this icon missing as well in: Setting --> System --> System UI Tuner.

19393,B07DDD8PNQ,Gina,2,6-Nov-18,True,Updated - Not So Great,"Updated 14 March 2019 - The camera on this phone is awful. I think it has gotten worse since I have had it, some of my older photos look great. But I realized I had basically stopped taking pictures of my kids because it was so bad. With 3 kids, that is unfortunately unacceptable for me. However, I was willing to deal with this and lug the DSLR when needed, until it stopped making and receiving certain calls. I do not believe this is a network issue as I have a gotten a new phone with the same network and SIM card, and I have not had any issues. It also did have additional storage options, which I did add, but so few apps are able to be run on memory cards, it was basically useless. If you don't have any apps, and are only using the memory card for photos, it might be a slightly better option. I wanted to like this, and it was okay for a bit, but it definitely lacked longevity for me. Original Review - About a year ago I dropped a pricy iPhone in the toilet and replaced it with a cheap Galaxy and have never looked back. To get this for under $200 makes me feel like a fool for ever having spent more on a phone. So the Galaxy was Euro and I am back in the States and it didn't work in a rural area on T-Mobile. This one does. Of course there are some cons. First, certain apps do crash (I'm looking at you, Amazon), but they restart right away. Also, the camera leaves a bit to be desired, but I was already used to the lack of stabilization with the Galaxy I had. Just use it for a few days and you'll get the hang of it, really. I get pictures of 3 wiggly kids. Pros: Price, additional storage options, easy to use. I am not a tech person, so I can't answer super specific questions, and there might be deficiencies that I'm unaware of, but for my basic use, it is doing exactly what it needs to do.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DDD8PNQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AzNrwxkUL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DDD8PNQ,77,159.0,0.0

The speaker for music isn't that great, but it gets the job done. The phone is built well, and it's survived a few drops. I love the fact that it has a microSD card slot and a removable battery. I have a 64GB card in it with plenty of videos and music on it. Currently you cannot have apps on the microSD, which is a bummer, but not a huge deal. As far as the OS, WP8 is awesome. It's beautiful, super fast, and has a lot of cool things built in. It is currently missing some features, but it is expected that Microsoft will add many wanted features with future updates. The live tiles are awesome, I couldn't imagine a phone without them now. The one thing I do miss is the ability to sync with Zune (WP7 had this ability), which, in my opinion, is the best syncing software out there. Hopefully Microsoft will add the ability back as many people have cried out for its return. So overall the phone is great.

Lack of apps aside, this is a great little phone. Slightly larger than my HTC 8x, it has a vibrant screen, decent battery life (and I pound on this thing all day with apps - the few the Windows store offers - with stuff running in the background sucking battery life), and an awesome camera. It was the camera that drew me (most MP offered on a Windows phone on the Verizon network). Its a little on the heavy side with a slick backing but that is easily remedied with a case.

2386,B00CQAODG4,Bill Wine,5,6-Jun-13,False,Finally a flagship Nokia on Verizon,"Purchased this at a Verizon store in white which gives a very clean modern look to the phone. Pros: The 4.5 inch screen is amazing! Very fluid with swipes and works well outside. Just yesterday a friend was trying to show me a photo on his iPhone5 while we were outside on a sunny day we were trying to shade it with our hands so we could see something/anything. The Nokia 928 has no such problems. Photos are great, especially indoor photos which would normally not come out well on a camera phone. Nokia Smart Shoot takes 5 photos with just one push of the button. When doing family shots it's great. You take a photo, which is really five, then you flip through the five and pick your favorite. Panorama is pretty cool too but I don't use it as much. Nokia maps, city lens, and drive are great! The ability to use the drive with no data usage is key to keeping your data usage down. The ability to set if and when it sounds the speeding warning is great. You can set different levels for speeds posted over and under 30 mph. So for under 30 I have it set to 5, for over 30 it is set to 9. The only thing I wish the Nokia drive had was an option to show a line by line of the directions. My Garmin has that feature and I used it often. The OS is the best. I love the live tiles and the ability to change the size of the tiles. If you use a app or feature more often you can give it a larger tile to make it easier to see/tap. Pining and unpinning tiles to the start page is a breeze. People hub is amazing for those that use there phone as a social device. All the Microsoft products that are included are great for people that use it more as a business phone. Cons: If you are coming from Apple the lack of some apps will be troublesome to you. Windows now has about 5.6% of the smartphone market, up from 3.8 YOY according to Kantor Research. I think once it hit's about 10% which should be early next year the apps will really start coming in. Size: If you are coming from an iPhone the phone might seem too large. Trying to use it with a single hand if you are a woman or a man with small hands might be difficult. I wanted a bigger screen to make web browsing and typing easier so I was appreciative of the larger screen. Finishing thoughts: The Nokia deserves a look whether you are entering the smartphone market for the first time or thinking of switching from Apple or Android. Try it out with an open mind and I think you will be surprised at how good it is.",10.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

2374,B00CQAODG4,LPD,5,6-Jun-13,False,Overall Excellent,"I've been using the phone for 3 weeks now. Very pleased with the performance, build quality, and the screen is excellent. The Windows Phone 8 OS is a huge improvement over WP7. The interface is still elegant. I know of a few people that switched from a Windows Phone to an Android, they now regret it. No one phone will be right for everyone, but there is no doubt that the Lumia 928 is one of the best phones regardless of OS now available on Verizon. I love the tight integration with Windows 8 desktop and I highly recommend using it with Office 365 for seamlessly syncing all your contacts, tasks, calendar, and email. (Your free Live Account will do a lot of that for you too, and you get 7GB Skydrive for free). If you had (or are leaving) a Blackberry, then that's the way to go. The phone should have some life to it because the hardware will handle the next major software upgrade from Microsoft. One problem I have with the Lumia 928 is something Verizon did, not Nokia: You can't add your PIN to the voicemail so it automatically goes to voicemail, pause a few seconds, provides the PIN, and you are ready to hear messages. Verizon must of killed the option so they could push their $3 a month Visual Voicemail. I hate those type of carrier practices, shame on Verizon. (One workaround is to add a person call Voice Mail to your contacts with a home number of *86,,PPPP# where PPPP is your PIN, then pin that contact to your home screen.) Again, that is a Verizon induced problem, not the Lumia's fault. The major criticism with the Windows Phone platform is the lack of Apps. Reviews are fond of pointing out that Apple and Android have a lot more Apps. But lets be real, of the hundreds of thousands of Apps, the majority are at best redundant but usually out right junk that no has downloaded and if they did they deleted them immediately after using them once. Also Microsoft does a much better job at scanning Apps for malware. So far I've been able to find the Apps I need on the Windows Phone. Those Apps tend to be well written, and consistent to the Microsoft App design guidelines. This consistency in design, menu place, overall organization make the phone a pleasure to use. Whereas Android does have many elegant Apps, the majority of Android Apps are a free for all of design, cluttered, inconsistent, and all too often darn right ugly to look at.",5.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

Also, strangely enough gmail app on this phone reports I have 9,999+ unread emails but gmail on my old phone doesn't do that. With an epic delay in getting notifications, it's really hard to tell why the unread count is so high. The hardware is really pretty though, and nice to hold. Also call quality is good, and my parents found dual-sim attractive as they travel and don't want to carry two phones.

15335,B075FL4H89,SL,2,6-Jan-19,True,Not user-friendly,"Cons: -To turn it on, you must press and hold the power button for 7 seconds (timed with a stopwatch), which feels too long. -Buttons don’t register consistently; often I must press them twice, particularly with automated phone menus. “Off” button doesn’t always disconnect calls. -Cumbersome, nonintuitive navigation, especially for Bluetooth. -Navigation ring around “call” button is difficult to manipulate. -“Lock keypad” doesn’t lock the keypad (1s, 2s, and 9s can still be dialed). Its only function is to create the extra step of requiring you to press “unlock” and asterisk to get back into phone after you’re timed out. “Lock keypad” should do just that--to prevent accidental emergency dialing. -Battery charge goes from 50% to dead, with no warning. Low-battery alert has worked only twice in six months. -Enclosed literature states: “Theoretical talk time up to 6.5 hours. Theoretical standby time up to 27 days.” This phone is nowhere near that. More like 6 days of standby. And when I used it for an emergency, 30 minutes of collective talk time drained the battery from 100% to 50% (see above). Was the phone close to dead? I had no idea and no access to an outlet if it was. This is not a smartphone. It should not eat up power.

Here is the trick, take 3-4mm strip of electrical tape and wrap one layer around the base of the magnetic adapter then push into the phone. It will not wiggle or move but you can still pull it out if you ever need to. Duct tape will work too. I purchased a rugged case. It's here on amazon but you can get it for less then $4 on Ebay.

1433,B00A2V7BA4,Count M,5,6-Dec-12,False,A next-gen smartphone that looks and feels like a premium device.,"Rather than go into the same old rundown of all the same features you'll read in every review, I'll give some of my standout experiences after using this thing for a few weeks. The weight issue that has been brought up by all the brainwashed reviewers out there is absurd. I say brainwashed because it's like they have been lead to believe lighter smartphones are always better because that's what Apple strived so hard for with iPhone 5. For me, iPhone5 is too light (I've had occasion to handle it quite a bit). My last phone was pretty light, and I hated the fact that when it slipped out of my pocket I could easily not even notice due to this fact. The Lumia920 weighs a bit more than most other smartphones coming out these days, but it is good weight. You hold the thing, and it feels like a million bucks in your hands. It's not just me; I know everybody wants to tout their smartphone as the best. Many friends, most of whom had pretty much no knowledge of Windows Phone 8 or the Lumia 920's existence (Nokia's advertising is still atrocious here in the US), hold this thing and instantly want one. No exaggeration, they love the feel, they love the screen, they like the tiles and the OS. They want one, and they haven't even gotten a chance to play around with the camera or throw it down on a wireless charging pad. Their iPhones and Androids seem old and tired after they've held it. And with regards to the wireless charging, I know many will think ""ahh, don't need that, how long does it take to plug in my phone anyways?"" True, you don't need one. But when you have it, it's so damn nice. It's awesome to come into work and be able to just plop your phone down, hear the cool little notification sound that your phone is now charging, and anytime you need to need to get up and go somewhere you just pick it up. It won't be long before Xi chargers can be found in coffee shops / restaurants and whatnot as well. Those are some of my experiences with this phone thus far. Nothing to complain about is this point, and I have yet to find any of its features to not be top notch.",15.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1664,B00A2V7BA4,SFK,5,6-Dec-12,False,Probably the best smart phone out there,"I got my Red Nokia 920 a while ago. Man its out of this world. I had a Samsung Android before this and an Iphone 3GS before that. I actually wanted to buy a Samsung Note 2 but... I have to say that my previous phones were not bad and I didn't have any major problems with them but they are dwarfed in comparison to this beast. The feel of this phone is different-it feels like a luxury item. Its heavier than Iphone and other android phones but I believe the weight is optimal for a phone of this class- if it were any lighter, it would not feel as good. The colors, edges, the back curve and contour of the screen are all amazing. The buttons on side could not be built any better. The tiny holes for the speakers are nicely done. In short, I am a big fan of the design and look it has. If I ever get time, I want to write a long article describing the amazing design.. It works really well. The core OS and UI is cool. I themed the phone with dark back ground and red colors for the screen and it looks cool. It was like matching the interior of a car to its outside color. The tiles are good. I am not a big fan of live tiles but some people may like it. The screen responsiveness and resolution is awesome. It works with gloves! UI is very simple and easy to learn-took me few minutes to get used to it. The camera is really good. The wireless charging works seamlessly. (Didn't try NFC with speaker as dont have one). I did have low battery economy initially but after decreasing the screen brightness, turning off location service and turning off back-ground apps, It lasts whole day (my day is 14 hours) without a recharge. ATT does not give you the headphones with this buy but i learned that the international version had headphones in the box.. The ecosystem (apps) is not as bad as I initially thought. I was able to find all the apps that I wanted (depending upon my android use) except one medical app which doctors use a lot (but was able to find a replacement). [...] was helpful to find the apps that I had difficulty searching in the market store. Having said that, I believe that the app store does need and will get a good boost in coming months. Nokia has done great work with some of its core apps. I greatly liked the Nokia music (can be used off-line and is ad free), Drive for navigation (again, can be used off-line), photoBeamer (its cool and seems to be a start of a new way of sharing data, please try it), Data-transfer, CityLens. To Summarize: Pros: Design/built/Colors, screen responsiveness/resolution , camera, Nokia city-lens, nokia drive, nokia music, wireless charging, smooth UI Cons: No headphones if you get this from ATT, Not as many apps (in comparison to other IOS and android markets) I think this phone is a new milestone in the evolution of smart-phones.

The loudspeaker quality is absolutely horrible. It's probably the worst I've ever had on any phone. The speaker is a muffles piece of junk, and somehow the OS produces a very noisy output. It's loaded up with unnecessary 3rd-party background apps, even though it doesn't look like it at first. It is not just stock android. Perhaps to try to make up for the small memory, it kills EVERYTHING you are not using. Even if it's a tiny app (like a 100k display filter), or if you have plenty of free ram, this phone likes to kill stuff. Even with a small browser with only text enabled (images and scripts turned off), this phone won't allow it to remain open with even one tab if you switch to another app and back. It doesn't have a smart memory manager, it just hates everything whether you have plenty of memory open or not. This really ruins Android. It's not stock, AND it doesn't like your apps. If you use a memory card, apparently it will sometimes lost track of it when you reboot and have to be removed and replaced. Thanks! I have had Androids with LOWER specs which work better than this. Bonus annoyance: The startup sounds can't be turned off, and it also make noise when you plug in a charger. Strangely, one things which does seem to work well on this phone is wifi hotspotting. I get a faster connection to this with my Chromebook than it did with previous phones. Tip: For some reason, when you insert your SIM T-Mobile sends the wrong APN settings. If you are only getting 3G, try manually changing your APN settings (wireless & networks - more > Cellular Networks > Access Point Names). Switch it to the one which has ""fast"" in the URL if it isn't already, and/or if necessary open whichever APN is selected and change the ""APN protocol"" to include IPv6.

3631,B00HWEMZ1E,LUCK,2,5-Oct-14,False,Not as Good as Older Versions of iPhone - Let Alone the Newest Versions,"I purchased the Nokia Icon back around March, 2014 and have been using it for over 6 months. In general, it is a functional phone that takes care of the important tasks that I most need - making calls, viewing/responding to email, and sending/receiving text messages. In this capacity, it functions about as good as any mobile phone I've used (I've used a number of Apple and Microsoft OS devices). It also has an ample number of apps available - I have no idea how it compares to the number of apps on other devices, but the bottom line is that there are far more apps available to me on this device than I have time to keep up with. It also has a very high quality camera that I use regularly. But, as time has passed, there has been an increasing annoyance with small things that you don't tend to notice until you use it for a while (and only if you can compare it to other devices). * There are a number of things I could do with my Apple iPhone many years ago that I still can't do with this Microsoft Windows device. For example, it was seamless to share music and video between iPhone, Apple TV and iTunes/PC/MAC. This process is still far from seamless with Windows (and I use Windows Phone, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Windows 8.1 tablet - and it is painful if not outright impossible to share across these devices as easily as it is on Apple devices). * My old Apple device would update quickly when a new OS was released. Windows Phone 8.1 has been out for months - and Verizon has still not released it. This may be more of a negative review of Verizon that Windows Phone/Nokia - but since it is one of the primary carriers (and the one associated with the product for this review), it is valid - and it is extremely frustrating. * Although the number of apps is acceptable, some important ones are either missing, have been removed, or have been hobbled. Google has acquired some important apps (such as a navigation app that Android users find very helpful) that they are no longer upgrading for Windows Phone. If you look at most vendors who ""have an app"" you will see links to the Google store and the Apple store - you almost never see links to the Windows store. The LinkedIn app, which started strong on the Windows Phone, has gradually gotten worse - to the point that I regularly get ""out of memory"" errors with it. * I purchased two wireless charging pads for my previous Windows Phone - which was an older model - and they both worked fine with it. Neither of them work with this phone (and one of them is a Nokia charging pad!). I keep expecting an update for the phone to fix this problem, but so far there has been nothing. * Some apps from Microsoft (such as Office, OneNote, CRM, etc) are great on my Windows Phone. But taking a look at them on friends iPhones and Androids - they seem every bit as good on those platforms. So I don't see the benefit of having a Windows Phone for those. * The one differentiator might be the Xbox Glass app - which lets me control my Xbox through my phone. But, at least as far as I experience it, this app just replaces the hand control for my Xbox. A novelty idea, but only a small convenience. I'm not sure - but this app may even be available on other phones too. I went with Windows Phone because my desktop, tablet and home entertainment are all Microsoft - and I wanted to have the same kind of interconnectivity with Microsoft devices as I enjoyed with my Apple. That benefit has never been delivered. Without it, the only compelling reason to use a Windows Phone would be superior apps - which have also never arrived. My next upgrade with Verizon is in March - if these things don't improve by then, I will likely return to Apple or maybe try Android. If you are all Microsoft, you may get by with the Windows Phone. If you're using Apple or Google devices in your home or business, then I can't think of a single reason why you would consider a Windows Phone.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

The Nokia is several hundred dollars less than competitive manufacturers. It comes with Android 8.1.0. but I understand it will be updated to the latest versions for several years. The phone itself is solid - no obvious sacrifices to reduce cost. It's about 0.5 inches longer than my Galaxy. I took a star away because of its minimal instructions and poor headphone. There is definitely an assumption that the user had Android previously. I moved my SIM card from my old phone to the Nokia without many issues. The Nokia takes a Nano size SIM card. I didn't realize that you can punch it out of your regular SIM card, I'm showing regular SIM card carrier in the attached pictures. The setup software moved all my applications to the Nokia without incident. I've used trial and error figure out how to organize my home screen. The headphone included with the phone is useless.

20486,B07HD3QC65,stardewkitteh,3,5-Nov-18,True,"Well built, looks great, nice display, decent specs but performance is a letdown","I was excited to see Nokia offer this phone in the US so I jumped when it was available for sale. If you have any doubts about the build quality or looks of this phone, you can dismiss them. The phone is extremely well built and looks fantastic. I would say better than some phones costing twice as much. The specs are pretty decent for the price as well - especially for a phone loaded with Android One. No heavy skin to weigh things down like so many other budget offerings. The icing on the cake is the screen. It's sharp, bright and the colors are very accurate. Again, hitting outside its class for a mid-range phone actually available and officially supported in the US market. Unfortunately, even with the SD 636 and 4GB of RAM, this phone lags and stutters a lot. I let all the updates finish loading before passing judgment but even with nothing running in the background, this thing just can't keep up. Swiping left into the Google feed is smooth as silk one time and jerky the next. Apps load slow and often times I would find myself tapping on an app icon twice thinking it didn't register my tap. It did but was just taking that long to even start loading. Pulling down the notification shade is another 50/50 experience - sometimes smooth, sometimes choppy. The camera app is also pretty sluggish for a phone with a 636 processor. The camera app is solid once it loads and photos are snappy to capture with good quality and detail in adequate lighting. Just don't expect miracles in low light at this price unless you have something to keep the phone very still and venture into pro mode. The mono speaker gets loud with only some minor distortion at high volume. Music sounds good through headphones but it doesn't push a lot of power to them so it's best to avoid anything with a higher impedance. Again, to be expected at this price. The HDR feature is nice and does make things pop a bit more but nothing mind blowing. Still, a nice little bonus to have in such an affordable phone with an IPS display. Finally, it has full support for US GSM carriers. I used it with T-Mobile and VoLTE worked great, data speeds were solid and connectivity was good even indoors. It should be noted if you are in an area with T-Mobile band 71 support, this phone does not support band 71. If you rely on Extended LTE with T-Mobile, you are limited to using band 12. I wanted to love this phone given how it looks and feels in the hand and all it brings at a good price. The screen is a pleasure to look at and photos are solid. I just can't get past the choppy UI experience. For a phone with Android One, it's definitely a letdown. I have a Moto G6 as my secondary device and that phone actually lags less in day-to-day use with far lesser specs. Perhaps this is something that can be fixed with a software update or will be addressed when the Android Pie update pushes out later this month. For now, if you purchase this phone expecting a smooth UI experience, you will likely be disappointed.",240.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

20489,B07HD3QC65,Nick Pruitt,5,5-Nov-18,True,"Great phone, low price or not","This phone is wonderful. I had not upgraded my phone in over 4 years. I was tired of being tied down by carrier phones that I had to pay off over 2-3 years just to get a decent phone that would work in the US. There are many phones from overseas that are offering so much, except that usually they dont have the correct bands to get LTE speeds in the US. I did a ton of research and decided to go with this phone and I am so happy I did. The biggest complaint I have seen about this phone is that it crashes or that the experience isn't smooth. I have not seen any of this. Granted the processor inside is not the latest and or greatest, but I have had 15-20 plus apps running at once and have seen no signs of slowdown or stutter. I may not use that most resource intensive apps but my old phone couldn't handle even 5-6 apps running so I feel like this is a win. Also if you have never used an Android One phone, it is very bare bones which I love. There were only 23 apps installed when I turned it on for the first time. My old LG phone had around 80+ when it was brand new. You know how many of those apps I used? Only the google default ones like apps and photos, so maybe 10-15. This is a huge win, and really allows android to run much faster. Also there is no manufacturer UI skin over the top. This usually slows phones down as well. The screen is really nice, the colors pop and the screen brightness is great as well. The camera does a nice enough job for me, even my friends with higher end IPhones and Samsung phones cant believe that I am getting photos like this out of a $350 phone. The build quality is beautiful, now I use a case ALL of the time for any phone I am using so you dont see it much but when I do take it out of the case it looks really nice, and much more expensive than what you are paying for.

1498,B00A2V7BA4,R. Messer,5,5-May-13,False,Ooozing elgance...can you marry a phone?,"OK so I have had the phone for about a week and here are some comments on the phone. First I must say I am an engineer and I work in product development and testing (hardware). Coming off three consecutive Android phones (2 Xperias and way back a Dell Streak) Here are a few thoughts on the phone: Pros: 1. The hardware is flippin amazing. I mean really really amazing. The iphone is an obvious comparison and they are on par (my wife has the 4S). The tolerances are very high and it is very well constructed. The unibody design does wonders. 2. The screen is very good. The pixel density may not be GS4 like but it is very very good. Bright, clear etc... 3. The camera is hands down the best camera that you can get on a cell phone. The pics are absolutely amazing. The video is even more amazing. I find myself taking pics ALL the time now which makes my wife happy cause she always says I never take any pictures of the kids... 4. Speaker sound is really good for a cell phone but dont expect wonders. It is on par with the Iphone according to 6 people drinking beers at a BBQ. 5. Call quality great 6. NOKIA apps are really great. (NOKIA MUSIC, Maps etc...). This is clearly the flagship Windows phone. Gray Area: 1. Windows 8 is great but not perfect. I have a windows 8 tablet and I love all the gestures and I was expecting it here. I also miss the file browser. I hear it is coming but it is silly that they don't have that. Why try to be like Apple when you have the hardware...come on MS! To be honest windows 8 on a tablet is a better experience minus the apps. 2. Initially I was a little bored with WP8 but found that once you get used to it you will actually find you use the functionality of the phone more. I really thought that was a load of BS from MS but I think they are right. Not to bash Android as I think the openness is really great but I find the WP8 experience to be smoother and everything runs faster. 3 Battery life is just OK. Cons: 1. BING button stinks like three day old fish. You will hit it from time to time and curse Microsoft for forcing it upon us. 2. I prefer hardware buttons vs touch screen buttons. They seem to stay out of the way better. 3. WP8 has a few problems and hiccups. It is very very functional but sometimes things do not work exactly as they should (like Nokia music saying you have not network connection when you do). Also some of the system design is a little backwards like the way it organizes your contacts. I think it is a matter of getting used to it. 4. MOST ANNOYING thing is the lack of continuity between windows 8 and Wp8. If you buy an app for your tablet you DO NOT get it free for your phone. This is utter rubbish in my opinion. Even with these negatives it is a 5 star product....",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

2451,B00CS2ZWKQ,Charlie,4,5-Mar-14,True,"Windows Phone is good, but still needs improvement","With Nokia 925 you will get a solid body with great build quality, but not the latest and greatest specs. WP 8 is a good mobile OS, but actually still needs a lot of improvement, specially when it comes to the quality and availability of apps. It looks like there are a lot of developers trying to put a lot of apps available, but with no consideration about quality and user experience. Just to give you an example, toast notifications are a privacy issue for a lot people (cannot be disable for system apps like SMS messaging), but it is in fact a parameter that can be control at programming level for a lot of other popular apps like Whatsapp and Line but it is still a missing feature. It does not have anything to do with the OS per se, but at the end it affects the overall user experience. I have read a lot of complaints about it and there are people that are actually willing to return their WP because of this, so it is important to consider. Another interest thing is that even though you are not getting the latest and greatest hardware, WP minimalist approach to user interface feels very fluid. It is not for everyone for sure, but I like it. Android will give you a lot of options to personalize your phone, but sometimes if you don't have great hardware specs, you will get lag and hurt user experience at the end. I believe that WP is not design for people who like to change and personalize their phones a lot, just to get something functional and minimalist. Do your own research and see if it matches what you expect from a smartphone. You will find good video reviews online that will help you with your decision. As far as I'm concerned, Nokia Lumia 925 is a solid phone, with a good OS, and expecting an OS upgrade in 2014 (WP 8.1) that will bring new features to get it closer to Android or iOS functionality.",2.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 925 (RM-893) 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone GSM Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-RM-893-Windows-Smartphone-Unlocked/dp/B00CS2ZWKQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MoEhAZS2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CS2ZWKQ,94,0.0,0.0

3623,B00HWEMZ1E,Matt O'Donnell,5,5-Mar-14,False,Best phone I ever owned,"I upgraded to the Nokia Icon from the Nokia 928. It is dramatically better, which is surprising because it looks about the same but with a 1/2 inch bigger screen. The hardware is clean and refined but it is really the subtle improvements with the OS/Apps that make this an awesome phone. With the larger screen you can get up to 6 tiles across (compared to 4 w/ 928) and the screen resolution is so good even very small text is easy to ready. Microsoft and Nokia also released some really nice apps that take advantage of the extra real-estate on the screen. For instance, the Bing Weather app (best weather app ever) shows current weather and switches to week forecast occasionally. Why don't all weather apps do this - it is all you really need and you don't need to launch the app as much. All of my important apps now fit on the one screen without scrolling, and with the extra information from the apps I really get a good view of my life on one screen.

It has all the features you need for a basic phone. I only need voice, text, and email. The battery life is impressive. A full day of use (including data) and the battery is barely depleted. The form factor is nice and small compared to the original, it disappears in your pocket. Caveats: No apparent way of silencing/changing ringer volume without going to volume settings.

3578,B00HWEMZ1E,Atariangamer,5,5-Jan-15,True,"Good, and getting better!","I ordered this phone for Christmas 2014, against the advice of nearly everyone. I was sure that the phone would live up to my needs and expectations of keeping me connected to my friends, family, and work. It has done that, and even more. Very smooth operation, great quality hardware, and a small but robust selection of useful apps that show there is potential to the platform. This list will grow when Verizon releases the Denim update sometime this year. While the camera gets alot of praise, I find it okay, but I'm no photographer. Battery life is about one day, never less. Just plug it in at night, or get a charging pad that Nokia sells. All in all, the phone lasts my entire workday of doing emails, texting and calls and still has some juice left over for a trip with the GPS or a few games. It hasn't been a problem yet, and I've already stressed it quite alot. My final suggestion, though, is this: go read up more detailed reviews of the Windows Phone system, and check that it does everything you want.

4928,B00O15MWOM,M. Kaplan,2,5-Dec-14,False,A surprisingly steep drop in quality from both the 521 and 635,"I recently purchased the Lumia 530 after dropping and breaking my beloved 521. What a letdown! The 530 is worse in almost every single way than the 521, with its one saving grace being a quad core processor (the admittedly low-end Snapdragon 200) in place of the 521's dual core. The phone is slightly shorter but noticeably chunkier - why, I have no idea. The worst offender here is the absolutely awful screen. Whereas the 521's modest-resolution screen at least produced blacks and colors sharply and with moderate clarity, the 530's is a washed-out, grainy nightmare with terrible viewing angles. Both the speakerphone and audio quality are noticeably worse (though the 521's speakerphone was also rather poor). Reception is roughly equivalent, and while the signal indicator did reveal a bar or two below what I was previously getting, it isn't clear whether that is due to worse reception or a more accurate reading. I feel like the plastic casing is also slightly more slippery this time around, though that could be my imagination, as I've more recently compared it to the 635, which has a subtly matte, textured finish to its back. The camera is still bad - but of course, it was pretty bad on the 521 (and will continue to be bad on these budget Lumias, I think, with the upcoming 535 remedying the problem somewhat via LED flash). Mine also had a problem with the screen turning back on during phone calls (issue with the proximity sensor?), though my new 635 suffers from this as well, so I'm not sure if this is just a problem rampant among the newer Lumias or what. Is the phone functional? Yes. Can you get it for as low as $35 at some retailers? Yes. But in this case, you get what you pay for. I know the T-Mobile Lumia 635 is overpriced at $100-130 compared to the AT&T version, which is currently going for $40-80, but that phone at $100 is a dream come true compared to the 530 at $35, particularly as the 635 has a slightly more powerful chipset and LTE. In fact, slow as it is, I'd sooner recommend the 521, which was recently updated to Windows Phone 8.1 Cyan, for the sharper screen alone.",22.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 530 White - No Contract (T-Mobile),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-530-White-Contract/dp/B00O15MWOM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ba7gOGt5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00O15MWOM,378,133.28,0.0

Here are the things that I did not like about the phone: * The Nokia Drive navigation app does not announce street names. It does show the names on the screen, but having to look down at the phone defeats the purpose of using voice enabled navigation. * Many websites do not recognize the phone as a mobile device, so the page is the desktop version. As such, the text does not automatically wrap across the screen. * A widely used podcast/mp3 was not recognized by the phone, so I was unable to download. * There are still quite a few popular apps that are not designed for Windows 8.

15332,B075FL4H89,Eric Hoover,2,5-Apr-19,True,So difficult to use I'm switching phones,"I've been using this phone for a month and it drove me so crazy that I'm ditching it and taking a loss on my purchase. I question anyone who gives this phone a good review. It feels like this phone was made without a user experience team. Yes, the phone can be coaxed into making calls and texts, but I can hardly use this phone for a minute without wanting to fling it off a train bridge. This list below is just a sampling of the complaints I have, which can be grouped into the following categories: 1. Infuriating user interface 2. Major limitations 3. Bad design in general 1. Infuriating user interface - It is incredibly difficult and unintuitive to do nearly anything on this phone. Even basic functions like calling and texting is difficult. It is very difficult to land on the home screen and instead I usually end up locking it accidentally. Pushing back one time too many (or pushing the upper half of the ""back"" button once) will instantly lock the phone, requiring you to unlock it again. Of every 5 times I lock the phone, only one is intentional. Locking the phone requires one button press - unlocking it requires 3. Most of the time spent on this phone is accidentally locking it, and then unlocking it, just to accidentally lock it again. This is one example of many, demonstrating the poor user experience. A few more: The only way to see the time is to lock the phone, let it turn black, and then turn it back on. Searching for a contact requires you to use T9, which is not very good for names, and then pulls up every contact who fits the requirement. It makes searching for irregular (Amiee), or super simple (J) names a huge burden. 2. Major limitations - This phone was created in 2017, but only has the capacity to hold 8 speed dials. Texts fill up in a week and the phone cannot receive more until old texts are manually deleted. Each text it holds progressively slows down the phone. It glitches out constantly, requiring you to exit to home screen and try again. The phone is missing basic apps, such as a notepad. The phone has laughably limited customization - all you can do is rearrange the order of your homescreen icons and change the color of your background. That's it. The phone has a small handful of annoying ringtones, only one of which is worth using. I haven't been able to get internet, facebook, or twitter to work even once. 3. Bad design in general - The ""end""/""backspace"" button is actually two buttons which share the same space. The phone comes preloaded with games like ""disney kingdoms"" ""real football"" and ""aspahlt nitro"" which take up real estate on your home screen and cannot be deleted.

Even basic functions like the alarm clock cannot be depended on. The alarm will vibrate but not sound when scheduled. I've tried every possible setting and checked for all of the latest updates, but the alarm still won't sound reliably. Second, the speakerphone is far too quiet at max volume.

Finally, the notification volume cannot be adjusted. Android 8.0+ supposedly combined the notification volume with the ringer volume, but while the ringer volume adjusts properly, the notification volume remains at max level all the time.

1470,B00A2V7BA4,Ace guy,5,5-Apr-13,False,Nokia music alone makes this device awesome !,"Best things I love about the Nokia lumia 920 (and the previous lumia 900): - Nokia Music: Allows me to create a custom mix of music just by typing in the artist's name. It also allows offline download so that I can download it over wifi and then playback in my car. All I need is an FM transmitter to play it over my car's speakers. - Nokia Drive: Really neat for driving directions and GPS - Nokia City Lens: Augmented reality app that shows me the restaurants, shops in an area by just pointing the camera in that direction - Skydrive integration: Any photos are automatically uploaded to my skydrive account which makes them accessible from any other device that has a skydrive app. - Xbox live integration: Lots of games to play for free (trial versions) - Sturdy build, great screen size, excellent camera and sound clarity. I dropped the phone a few times and keep it in my jeans pocket...still no scratches. Here are some tips I use to maximize the battery life: 1. Turn Off the location sensor (GPS) unless I'm driving and I need a GPS. 2. Turn Off the WiFi unless I'm streaming music or downloading large files (like games, music, etc). For all other purposes the 4G LTE is really fast and I don't really need WiFi 3.

19366,B07DD71K4D,AggieRose,2,4-Nov-18,True,Poor performance as a phone; doesn't handle software well.,"I have owned smartphones by Samsung, HTC, and Motorola, all of them mid-range or low-priced models. Prior to smartphones, I had a Nokia cell phone which worked very well for several years, so I decided to give a Nokia smartphone a try. I have been quite disappointed. As a phone: Call quality is clear and reception is good, but pros end there. When placing a call, it will often take the phone as long as 30 seconds to even begin dialing, as if it cannot find a cellular signal despite what the status bar at the top shows. Calls get dropped more often than this phone than I have been used to with other phone. I sometimes miss two or three incoming calls in a day because the phone fails to ring even though it shows full signal strength. As a smart device: Glitches are frequent. After a couple of months of ownership and two automatic system updates, I have noticed an increase in the frequency of ""App not responding"" errors. Notifications from apps with push notifications often don't appear until much later; usually those notifications pop up only after I've awakened the phone for some other reason. I have purposely not loaded the phone with many extra apps - I don't use it to play games or check Facebook, and I avoid apps with copious ads and ones that are known for using system resources - yet the phone still struggles to keep up and lags a lot. The camera quality is good with several resolution settings, but in the last few weeks, even the camera app has had difficulty opening and being focused and ready to take a photo in under 15 seconds, which is a long time compared to every smartphone I've owned before, even the cheap ones. I cannot recommend Nokia for smartphones. Perhaps they have models better than this one, but I am not willing to take the risk. I over-research when buying a phone and have never kept a phone for less than two years, even the cheap ones that were known to be so-so when I purchased them (good price for what they were), but I am seriously considering replacing this phone after about three months of use; 21 more months with it just sounds too painful to me.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - White - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DD71K4D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rmi1HiNQL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DD71K4D,64,109.0,0.0
20742,B07HD3QC65,Dan Shearer,4,4-Nov-18,False,Good mid-range phone,"I was replacing a Google Nexus 6p that first had notification problems and then a fading battery. The Nokia 7.1 looked like it had similar performance to my three year old high-end phone. I wanted the steel color but couldn't wait so I got the blue. It looks black to me, so don't hesitate to get blue if you are used to a black phone. One disappointment was that it didn't have an FM radio, at least in the U.S. version. There are indications that it does have an FM radio on the Nokia web site (like the user's manual), but the earliest reviews said it didn't. Mine doesn't. My other disappointment was the LCD display did not get as dark as my Nexus 6p AMOLED screen. If I set it up with a clock as a screen saver by my bed the screen is a relatively bright gray with relatively dim white numbers. Very low contrast at low brightness levels. I'll probably just use my old phone as a clock. Although the diagonal screen measurement is very slightly larger than my old phone, it is a longer and narrower screen. It seems a little small in my hand. I'd like a bigger screen, but others may like this shape better. The notch is not too bad, but it does crowd the notifications a little bit. One of my clock screen savers did not black out the notch when the screen was horizontal, but another one is fine. Everything transferred from old phone to new with no problem. The biggest chore was arranging my home screen and signing back into many of the apps. Everything worked the same, no compatibility problems. The battery was at about 65% at the end of a day of normal use for me. That's better than the old phone ever did. Given what I paid for the Nexus 6p, the Nokia 7.1 is a nice value, with almost everything I was looking for. I'll have to see if the high-end phones in 3-4 years can offer something worth paying more for.

20500,B07HD3QC65,Amazon Customer,1,4-May-19,True,Nokia 7.1 phone is pure garbage!,"I bought this phone mid-January 2019. It is now the beginning of May 2019 and the USB C charging port is failing. I have to send it off to be repaired. The support person claimed it was an unusual failure but you'll find reports of this problem here in reviews and in Nokia's forums. Clearly a design flaw that they will not address other than to repair the phone until the warranty runs out and then they'll do nothing. After repair, I expect another failed USB C port as many have described repeated failures of the same component after repair and/or replacement.

20686,B07HD3QC65,Grant,2,4-Mar-19,True,Poor audio/call quality and battery life ruins an otherwise great phone,"I really, really wanted to like this phone. The build quality is phenomenal for the price, the subtle dark blue looks good, stock Android / Android One / fast updates has become a requirement for me, it has NFC for GPay, has a decent camera (but not great: washed out colors, slow shutter) and it still has a headphone jack. There is occasional stuttering in the UI, but it’s noticeably faster than my last phone with a Snapdragon 630 (vs Nokia 7.1’s 636). The screen is great for this price, good contrast and brightness, the notch doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would (there’s also an option in settings to hide it) and is a good size. I also thought the rather large “chin” would bother me, but it ended up being a nice place to help hold the phone while typing or watching videos in landscape that isn’t touch sensitive. The screen is taller than my last phone, not wider, so it’s not any more difficult to hold. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. There are however a few issues I’ve ran into that are deal breakers. First, call volume is very low when using VoLTE. Turning the call volume all the way up still results in a quiet call. Turn off LTE or switch to WiFi calling and call volume is loud again, as expected. This seems specific to Voice-over-LTE, which is mostly deployed in urban/metro areas only. Second, the audio quality from the headphone jack is quite poor. I can hear loud static/interference for <1 second every time I plug or unplug headphones or an AUX cable, or even when pressing the Play or Pause buttons on screen. I tried multiple music apps such as Google Play Music and Pandora, seems to be hardware related as they all do it. I also hear a whining sound (like a ground loop) when it’s plugged into my car charger and AUX input (I realize some level of this is normal, but this is significantly louder than my last phone). Finally, the battery life is subpar. I find myself having to charge it in the evening around dinner time, even when starting out at 100% in the morning. It’s running Pie and I am fairly aggressive about not installing battery draining apps (no social media apps, for example), keep the screen brightness down, disable ambient mode, disable Bluetooth, etc. Even still, the battery life isn’t any better than my previous >1 year old phone, with the battery degradation that comes with a year of fast charging. I don’t talk on the phone much but when I do, I want to be able to hear the other person and I want them to be able to hear me. I listen to music a lot using wired headphones or an AUX cable, so audio quality of the built in DAC, supporting circuitry and headphone jack are all important to me.

3633,B00HWEMZ1E,Tommy,1,4-Mar-14,False,Not all that...,"Im coming from a Note 3 and ive had just about every phone you can imagine over the years. Recently my N3 broke so i had to go to Verizon and buy a phone, i read and read the reviews and finally decided to give the Icon a try. First, the camera is not that great, indoor shots are terrible and grainy and outdoor shots are mediocre. Everyone in the reviews keeps saying how wonderful the cam is but compared to my S4 and Note 3 the pics are not as good. The tiled menu interface is OK, i can get used to that but the lack of the apps in the app store is a real downer. The handful of popular apps they do have seem outdated and very badly written. For example, Facebook on this phone reminds of Facebook on the BlackBerry Bold, very clunky, things don't load fast and smooth, inability to do simple things that you take for granted with other operating systems, like ""clicking like"" on a pic. The ""People"" stream/interface is horrid, it pulls in info from all over the place but when you click on a item it gives you a very bad/limited view of how to interact back. The feel of the phone was nice and i have to say that the speakerphone and the call quality were superb, probably the best call quality i have heard in a long time on any phone so kudos to that. Other things like having to go into settings, then into WIFI, to join a network is a pain, there should be a toggle switch somewhere for that but there isnt. Im not saying this is a horrible phone but just my honest opinion of it. Anything i use that slows me down is just not for me, this phone completely slowed me down. Even the email formatting is a pain, to view images you have to click ""view images"" in every email, there is no default option to have it view images. Come on Microsoft.... Also, one last gripe, and the most important, the battery, its HORRIBLE. I charged the phone fully, pulled it off the charger at 7AM, never turned bluetooth on, had it on WIFI in my condo all day and by 7PM i was at 31%.

20502,B07HD3QC65,A. Lee,1,4-Jun-19,True,Nokia Does Not Honor Warranty,"I bought the Nokia 7.1 through Amazon and made sure that the seller was indeed from Nokia itself. I bought it November of 2018. My understanding is that if the phone is defective it would be covered under Nokia's one-year warranty. So in February, I started noticing that the USB-C port was wobbling side to side which cut off charging. I also noticed it cut off my connection to Android Auto in my car which uses a wired connection. I let it go for a while and by May 2019, I felt it was time to contact Nokia about the problem, hoping that the warranty would kick in. I sent in my phone after contacting their website and providing my IMEI. When I got my phone back 11 days later, Nokia attached a letter stating that they found ""water damage"" and would not honor the warranty. I found this to be ridiculous as I use my phone at home and in the office and never immersed my phone into any water. Secondly, the problem was a wobbly USB connector, which is a mechanical part. If there was water damage, I believe the phone would stop working in it's entirety. In any case, I am now stuck with a Nokia phone after 7 months that doesn't have a functioning USB-C port. There's no recourse. If you think logically about this, Nokia can claim water damage for every possible defect on their phones which absolves them of any responsibility. The bottom line is that how can I prove that my phone wasn't dunked in water which it wasn't? Why is the onus on me? Anyhow, if you want to buy this phone or any Nokia product for that matter, stay away if you want assurance that their warranty will be honored.

I finally returned my 928 after trying to make it work for 1 month, 2 factory resets(wiping your hard drive) and endless soft ones later(taking out your battery) plus one failed backup. My skydrive app failed also. AMZN even offered to extend my return period to 90 days. VZ's flagship 928 windows phone which arrived in mid May is now free with VZ. If you take photos, make calls send emails and are already set up with windows PC this phone will probably work great for you.WP8 is a very quick, user friendly and customizable platform, when it works . The 928 is a very nice looking phone that takes awesome low light photos.Few Nokia apps are top notch. I would rate Nokia's nav app Heredrive right up there with goggle maps Otherwise windows store apps and platform are buggie. Windows store app reviews are fiction. MapQuest got me lost twice while I was waiting for it to provide me with its advertised voice activated, turn by turn nav app that adjusts to drivers route. Its does none of those. 2 emails to MapQuest customer service on this issue went unanswered . 928 battery life, update and audio issue posts are all over windows forums. Nokia put a high performance speaker in this phone but there are no settings to adjust bass. When a song with lots of bass comes on you get that blown speakers sound. Otherwise audio is 5 star. Advice. Do not contact VZ windows tech support; total waste of time.Go to wpcentral or Microsoft community forums for support Twice I went to VZ stores with windows questions. Both times they tried to push android/i phones on me even a set of $200 blue-tooth speakers to help me deal with my windows issues. I walked out store both times. You may as well be speaking Chinese when you say word windows to them. Was all marketing I'm afraid.

DISCLAIMER: my wife is not a gamer so the apps that seem to launch smoothly are basic ones like google maps, texting, contacts, google search, calendar, etc. - camera is nice but not amazing; if you need a great camera look to a more expensive phone like the iphones, samsungs, google pixels, xiaomis, etc. but this is basically a good phone camera (would give it a 7 out of 10) and slightly better than my daughter's Moto G6 which is a less expensive mid-ranger. low-light photos may suffer. - battery life: my wife gets through the day fine on light to moderate usage without gaming. - the build quality is nice but still glass so it is a bit slippery (ordered a case), has that ""small"" phone feel but the screen is great. my wife has small hands so she did not want a big phone - the software is nice and clean without bloatware because of the android one program - the fingerprint reader is not as big as other phones we've used so sometimes hard to find on back with index finger - the glass attracts fingerprints TL;DR: EXCELLENT - software (android 9.0 and quick updates), display quality, size (for those who like smaller, one-handed use phones), build quality/looks, works with Cricket wireless, still has headphone jack, USB-C quick-charging GOOD (not necessarily great)- camera, performance, battery life BAD - not all apps optimized for Pie 9.0 (like cricket visual voicemail), glass (screen and back) attracts fingerprints, fingerprint reader is a little small and close to flush with back so takes some time getting used to finding it blindly OVERALL: quality phone and probably best android One phone you can get specifically for US market UPDATE (JAN 7): Cricket Visual Voicemail App DOES WORK. need to wait for the text/notification from Cricket to activate before setting up on the app. so now, that complaint is OFF the LIST.",6.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

Under excessive data usage or gaming when your not home to use your computer, this will drain the battery very quick. Under light usage, with data or wifi/location on, its fairly normal drainage for me. You would know (In my opinion), that the battery is draining rapidly as the phone heats up.

The Lumia 920 is a very well made phone with a fantastic screen. My first few days with it were wonderful, the OS is a joy to use. Easy to navigate but full of features to make things interesting. No slow downs, freezing, or resets. The choice of fonts, contrast, and screen clarity make it a joy to use. Then on day four I only made it thru half the work day... never had a battery die so quickly. I turned off wifi on day 5 and made it thru work and almost home before the battery gave up. No video use, a little music, a blue tooth headset, phone calls, a few small searches on the net, check weather and it's almost gone. I would have thought it was a bad phone but I'm seeing other users with battery issues (that they say improve over time). The only thing I'm sure that time cures is return rights. *** Update Ending up keeping the phone and yes the battery life improved. I'm not sure why and I've never had it happen on a phone before, but it was like it needed a few charges discharges to get it's full power. I would now rate this phone 6 stars (If I could). Some reviews will say it's ""heavy"", no it's very well made and solid. The first phone that I think could survive everyday use and drops without a case. Plus we are talking ounces here, heavy really... Best screen I have ever seen (and the Infuse was great). Clear, bright, vibrant, easy to read, and no glare. Everything just works and works well. The auto adjust on brightness is the first I have been able to leave on. Most phones try to stay on the dim side and then adjust at odd times for no reason. I never notice the Lumia adjusting, it just seems to pick up the correct brightness for the conditions and stays there. I'm in computer support so I see a lot of interfaces. The Lumia Windows OS is fantastic. Anyone who picks the phone up understands the interface within minutes. Microsoft looked at the existing systems and then designed one for actual smartphone use. It's not complicated or 10 levels deep, so everything is close to the main menu and easy to get to. No lags or slowdowns on this phone, movement is crisp. Everyone knows the camera is the best on any smartphone so that was a given. Low light shots are great and the camera stabilizes so well it looks like you used a tripod.

26662,B07XVZXR5Y,Henry,4,4-Dec-19,True,Great Phone for the price but literature and claims on what the phone does is misleading,"May be is because I used to really like Nokia phones before they went into wrong hands. Now that they came back I had higher expectation when I finally decided to switch from Samsung and other phones and decided to get the Nokia 7.2. The phone arrived very early, in fact a day earlier, and I really appreciate that. I was so excited to open it. The package comes with items as described. I had ordered a case and a screen protector from another vendor. I have to admit, I have never tried to install a screen protector before but I did this one and it turned out great. The phone was charged to 63%, went ahead to charge it to 100% before I switched it on. Moving all my stuff was easy as I have a google account though some of my Apps have not moved, I am still working on it. My disappointment is on the battery life and SIM cards. They claim the battery will last two days, but for me it didn't. I did not use it that much, switched it on about 6pm, by 2.30pm next day it had only 5%. This is a really disappointment to me. Another disappointment is on SIM cards. There is confusion when you read the reviews, some people say it has two SIM cards (Probably this is for foreign editions, not the one I bought) and one Micro SD card. Mine has a tray that a place for the second SIM card is blocked, so you can install only one SIM card and one Micro SD card. I bought it thinking I could have two lines. The document shows how you install 2 SIMs but actual tray has one of the place for a SIM card permanently blocked with a plastic plate. I bought the phone because: 1) I want to go back to Nokia as I used to love it, all my old phones were Nokias. 2) I thought I will have two lines in my phone (disappointed) 3) It has a lot of memory to store all my videos and photos. I have a ton of them. 4) The camera is fantastic for both videos and photos 5) Price is reasonable compared to the rest 6) I thought battery will last as stated (not impressed) 7) The look and build 8) Software and expected updates, etc I am not saying it is a bad phone, I am just expressing my disappointment on what I thought I was buying. Since I have not used it much, I will think about it and decide whether I want to keep it or not, the literature is misleading. The two things were in my major issues that led me to choose the phone.

I never order something before it has had a chance to be reviewed, but I figured Nokia builds great phones. Everything seemed as expected, and I was happy with the setup. However, I noticed on the first charge from around 50% that the phone wouldn't quick charge. I swapped chargers with a known good one, but the problem persisted. I worked with Nokia support on this, and they recommended I send it in for repairs. I don't believe my phone is the only one as I saw another review on Amazon with a customer reporting an issue with the charging port.

2363,B00CQAODG4,M Gerrish,5,4-Dec-13,False,Loving an electronics device is just wrong. But I love this phone!,"My husband needed his own computer device, but he isn't a computer guy. What to do? I have a Kindle Fire, very useful for media consumption, but he wanted something that felt more like a computer, so we chose a Windows Surface RT because it would integrate well with the computer system we already use for work and entertainment. Good choice. Then his iPhone died. Moving on from Apple and continuing on our Windows path, we chose a Nokia Lumia 900 series phone available from his cellular network. I fell completely in love with his phone, so even though my Motorola Droid wasn't dead, I headed into my cell provider's shop and traded up. Way up. (Not an Amazon-verified purchase because I got the phone directly from my cell provider.) It's the camera, is the thing. It takes great shots in low light (if the subject isn't moving) without a flash. I love the ""live"" tiles. I love the customization of those tiles. I love the clarity of sound (""Can you hear me now?"" ""WOW, yes I can!""). I love the integration with my Windows 8.1 laptop. I love the Nokia-provided apps. I love using 6tag to get to Instagram (which is now available) because it offers more filters and frames than Instagram itself. I just love this phone. If you're thinking of switching from an iPhone or Android system, know this: some sales people will tell you that you'll have to manually re-enter all your contacts. Not true. Nokia has an app called ""Transfer My Data"". If you don't already have one, create a Microsoft-based eMail (an @outlook.com, @Hotmail.com, @live.com, etc) account. You don't ever have to use it if you don't want, but you'll need it to manage the phone. Download the Nokia Transfer My Data app into your new Nokia. Turn on the Bluetooth in both your new Nokia and old phone. Within a minute all your contacts, photos and video will transfer to the new phone. Now customize the screen to your heart's content.

1172,B00836Y6B2,Becca,5,4-Dec-12,False,Great Phone!,"The Nokia Lumia 900 was my first smartphone. Im a programmer, so I really appreciate how easy it is to write software for it. That being said, the phoen itself is what I'm rating so lets get to it. The Good: I love the feature-rich experience and the battery life is quite good. Despite what I have read from other websites it seems fairly light to me (then again, I don't like owning a smartphone that feels like its gonna float away). The speaker is one of the loudest I have ever heard on a smartphone, and it outputs really good quality audio too! The camera takes excelent quality photos and I feel that it is quite feature-rich. The flash is extremely bright, and makes a good flashlight in a pinch. the case is so tough that I dare someone to try and break it. I have yet to scratch the phone case itself and I have had this phone for about 6 months now (I tend to drop my phone, so this is impressive). The Bad: Let me first say that I DO NOT have a problem with the hardware. I have a few compaints about the software though. If you know about WP already then the rest of this section won't help you. That being said, I would dearly like to be able to make playlists on the go without the need to sync with zune software. I will also be excited when more developers get apps into the store (although all the ones I need are already there). My biggest issue right now is the OS upgrade, or rather the lack of one. WP8 came out and lumia 900 users kinda got the shaft. Bottom Line: This phone is an excelent choice! The price is excelent, the calls are clear, the interface is sleek, and the phone is near indestructable. I would like to see some love from microsoft in regaurds to software upgrades, but other than that I would (and do) recomend this phone to anyone who wants a good, dependable phone.",27.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
1765,B00A2V7ULY,Anon,5,4-Dec-12,False,"Amazing Phone, Everyday a new feature discovered.","This has been the best phone I've ever owned. Previous smartphone use was an iphone4, which is a good phone, but it is boring and stagnant by comparison. I was going to get an iphone5, but think Apple flopped big time on that one and decided to venture into the uncharted windows waters. I am glad I did. The live tiles are very cool, the camera on this phone takes stellar night photos and video, and the customization makes it very cool. Being able to pin tiles to the start screen of the people you contact most is awesome - 1 click and you get a screen where you can text/email/call with just one more click. The voice activated function works pretty well and the speech recognition is good, especially with microsoft's translator app which is very cool (text and voice translations). Nokia music rocks as well, you can download upto 4 music collections to use offline and they have very good songs in every collection I've checked out. Phone feels very solid and the yellow color is a stunner. Screen is bright and vibrant, especially compared to the iphone. I really like how the e-mail syncs and the way texts look with a black background and white writing. Battery has to be seasoned in order to work properly - charge to 100%, drain till it turns itself off, charge up to 100%, drain again, then charge back up and you should get full use of the battery. Pretty much everyone is doing this and it is no big deal. Highly recommend this one.

1740,B00A2V7BA4,M.D.,4,4-Dec-12,False,"Better than the Lumia 900, but still not perfect","I pre-ordered my cyan 920 so I've had it since launch. Like my Lumia 900, I'm not going to review the Windows Phone OS as much as I am going to focus on the hardware. In some cases, I am going to compare the 920 and 900. The good: - the display is smudge/fingerprint resistant; - the display resolution is a big improvement over the Lumia 900 (I believe it's slightly higher in pixel density over the iPhone 5); - the buttons and camera bezel/trim are scratch resistant; - the battery life is a significant improvement over the Lumia 900, but there is a caveat (see below); - the camera is a big improvement over the Lumia 900; - the wireless charging; The bad: - on a couple of occasions, the battery has mysteriously and rapidly drained itself. I don't know if this is a Windows Phone 8 bug or a Nokia firmware bug; - dust collects under the front facing camera; - the proximity sensor sometimes does not work (due to dust leaking in) so the screen stays dark during toast notifications or when trying to hang up a call. One fix is to blow air at the top of the phone where the front facing camera is; - there is a very, very, very tiny gap where the top of the display meets the chassis. I thought this was normal until I checked out my co-worker's red 920. His red 920 does not have this gap, however, the top of the chassis on his phone flexes and creaks when pressure is applied. Overall, I think the 920 is a good improvement over the 900. I'm a bit disappointed that flaws such as the dust getting behind the screen glass and the chassis creaks made it past testing and into production. Software issues can easily be fixed by software updates, but how do you fix hardware design flaws? Given that, I'm not sure I would recommend the 920. UPDATE - 2012-12-24 I got tired of blowing compressed air daily to clear the proximity and front-facing camera and I contacted AT&T to warranty it. Unfortunately, cyan is backordered. UPDATE - 2013-01-13 I received my replacement 920 on Mon-Jan-7. While AT&T's warranty dept was nothing but accommodating, my original order was mysteriously cancelled. Luckily, I checked my order status daily; unfortunately, AT&T didn't have a reason why my original order was cancelled. Anyway, I've had a week with the replacement 920 and so far, so good with the dust issue (there is no gap between the seal of the display and chassis). The biggest inconvenience was app and setting migration to the new unit. Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved the process over Windows Phone 7 -- it re-downloads all of your apps and it migrates most of the phone settings, but a lot of app settings and a few phone settings (i.e. tiles on homescreen) aren't migrated. The honeymoon is back and I've updated my rating.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1804,B00A7F57EM,Ryan,5,4-Dec-12,False,A Great Choice,"I picked up the Nokia Lumia 822 last week and so far I absolutely love this phone. Hardware: Overall--outstanding. Rock solid construction--it feels substantial and well-made. Screen--crystal clear, smooth animation, vivid colors. Camera--I'm not a heavy camera user, but in the few pictures I've taken the camera has worked well, even in low light. Phone--During calls, earpiece audio is clear. Folks I am speaking with say I sound much clearer than my previous phone. Size--the right size for me at a 4.3 inch screen. I don't want anything larger than this because it gets too large to fit comfortably in my pocket. Battery Life--good. I keep most of my apps from running in the background and I can get 2 days out of it. Other users who keep more apps running will likely get one day from the battery. Software/Ecosystem: Windows Phone 8 is awesome. The level of integration between the phone OS, Microsoft Office (including Outlook), apps, Facebook etc., and hardware is outstanding. A great example of this is the People Hub. From one live tile, I can access any of my contacts, whether they are contacts through Facebook, Outlook (from work), Skype, or just a regular contact on my phone--they are all in the People Hub. If I pull someone up, I have several options--I can call them, text them, email them, write on their Facebook Wall, call them on Skype, get directions to their house, etc. The phone pulls in all this information automatically from all of its sources (Facebook, Skype, etc.) so I don't have to spend hours assembling the information myself. Rather than opening up a specific app to do a specific thing, all I need to do is pull up my contact in the People Hub. This is a simple example, but it's one of many innovative features on Windows Phone. One final note--the phone is great for work because it has Microsoft Office & Outlook. I can sync Outlook on my phone with my work email server so that I can easily stay on top of things at the office, without having to rely on a third party app written by a no-name company. I can easily edit Office documents on my phone and sync them to SkyDrive so they are immediately available on all my devices (work computer, personal computer, tablet), all integrated into the phone out of the box.

20507,B07HD3QC65,Josh C,2,4-Apr-19,True,"Nokia won't support the phone, Amazon to the rescue!","I have had several Moto phones and this was my first Nokia. There are some features about this phone that are great like the camera and the screen. However after the latest update apparently disabled wifi calling and wifi SMS which I need because I do not have cell reception at my house. I called Nokia 3 times and spent hours on the phone with them. They had me change dozens of settings and finally do a factory reset on my phone. On the third call with my Wifi SMS/Calling still not working the Nokia person told me that it was the latest software update that caused the issue and I would have to wait until another update came out to fix the problem. I told them I couldn't wait and they said they cannot send me a new phone because the new phones have this problem as well and that they cannot return my old phone because it was two months old. Finally, I called Amazon and they allowed me to return my phone to get my money back so I can buy a new Moto phone that I should have gotten in the first place. So beware of buying a Nokia phone, if you have any issues the best case scenario is that you have to mail them the phone and wait for them to fix it.

1749,B00A2V7BA4,C. Etienne,2,4-Apr-13,False,Great Windows Phone 8 OS on a Very Buggy Phone,"5 huge stars for Windows Phone 8 os. 2 stars for the Lumia 920 phone. I pre-ordered this phone so I have had it from day 1. This review is written after almost 5 months of use so I write from experience. Microsoft outdone themselves this time. Office 365 works so well between the phone and my windows 8 pc. The operating system has so much going for it. Very well designed and a huge upgrade from the tired old iPhone os. The biggest problem is of course the available apps or lack of. And after 5 months of waiting they aren't coming either, at least not as quickly as Microsoft promised. Minus the apps, the phone operating system gets 5 stars overall. There are a few annoyances with the music app and synchronizing between my desktop and the phone. Otherwise I love windows phone 8. But I hate Nokia Lumia 920. I tried hard to love this phone but it has let me down so many times with hardware problems. I should have known from day one because the first phone I got failed to connect to any data network. After days of troubleshooting with AT&T they sent another one. Still occasionally the phone loses signal for hours when other persons with the same provider are talking away. Nokia Lumia 920 goes blank with no human provocation. I have missed my alarm several times because the phone died in the middle of the night even with a full charge. The only way to bring it back to life is to do a soft reset (power + volume down buttons). Not a reliable alarm clock. Nokia Lumia 920 battery is unreliable. Some days I spend the entire day on one full charge. Other days the phone simply dies after a few hours, without even using the phone. Not sure is this is the fault of the OS. This happens sometimes even with no apps running in the background. I have taken all the steps to minimize battery drain, still this happens very frequently and is very unpredictable. I have no idea what drains my battery and why sometimes it is still almost full after an entire day. The headphone jack is problematic after 5 months. My music now switches to the next tune simply by moving the headphone jack. So in order to listen to an entire song with the phone in my pocket I have to walk in slo-mo. But on the positive I can switch to the next song simply by wiggling. Pretty awesome feature if you ask me. On the plus side Nokia has some pretty great apps including the navigation. The camera is as solid as they claimed. The phone is very nicely done and I like the large size, looks like a manly man's phone next to my wife's puny iPhone 5. I only wish I didn't get the red one, it just don't look manly especially when my daughter changes the theme to pink. Anyway, that is my review after 5 months of use. Hope you found it useful.

13966,B071ZDQ6MV,Valentin,2,31-Oct-17,True,Not ready dor USA prime time. Network issues.,"The phone has potential but not there yet. It was fast the first week but it seems to slow down as the apps store more data. The fingerprint sensor worked better in the beginning but it seems like it will require constant cleaning. It takes a while now to unlock. The small size of the sensor is probably the cause for that. I'm on Tmobile USA. The 7.1.2 update a week after I got the phone disabled the Enhanced LTE mode - VoLTE. It was working fine always staying in enhanced LTE mode before the update. Now it never does. I've tried resetting network settings, APNs - nothing helped. The Nokia support chat had no idea, they could not even provide info if the phone was fully compatible with Tmobile. Since the update the coverage has ben worse, it goes from 4 bars 4G to 3G to even 2G for no apparent reason. Since it took me several days to setup everything I don't want to do factory reset and start from scratch just to test if that is going to help. I thought that since Aamazon is offering this with Prime ads the phone was fully vetted for USA compatibility. It seems like that was not the case. Nokia has been good with monthly updates but the last update made the phone worse. I have 10 more days of the 30-day return period and will probably return it if there is no update during that time to fix the above issues.",12.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

1094,B00836Y6B2,Amazon Customer,2,31-Dec-13,True,Disappointing overall :(,"When I first got this phone I was really excited after hearing so many good things about it and all the nice features it has. However it's had a lot of problems and the store I bought it from on Amazon made it out to be a product made for the U.S. but it wasn't. As such there was no warranty on my phone and when it started having a lot of problems I had to return it. Amazon was really helpful in this as it was a couple months past the return date and they still gave me a partial refund. Nice Features: Camera: I love this camera. Takes beautiful pics especially up close photos with the macro setting. Colors always come out perfect in the daytime, but in any low light the colors come out really off. User Friendly: I do really like this about the phone. The tiles are fun and easy to use. I really liked the ability to shrink some of the tiles so that you could fit 4 in the place of a big tile, but this quit working on my phone after I was forced to restore it. Dislikes: Windows ''Marketplace:'' As windows is just starting out there aren't really any good apps. There's no good map app for one. Cold weather: This bugs me to no end. Any temperature below 60 degrees causes the phone to black out on the bottom half of the screen. If it's anywhere near 60 dark lines show up on the screen. You can still use the phone if you know where to click, but the blackened part is all pixely and it takes forever for it to go back to normal. Text/Pic Messaging: I bought this phone to use with Net10. I had to search around everywhere to find the correct codes to enter to get text and pic messaging to work but I finally found them. It worked for a couple months but then it just stopped working. I could send and receive texts, but I could only receive pics, I couldn't send them. It was really frustrating since Net10 technically doesn't ""guarantee'' pic messaging so they wouldn't help me. Overall, I was really looking forward to this phone, but it's really disappointing how much quit working. I don't know if just my phone is defective or if this has happened with a lot of people. But it really wasn't worth the money I just wish I would've figured it out while I could still get all my money back.",1.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
1671,B00A2V7BA4,hoytlington,5,31-Dec-12,False,So glad I switched from Android,"I love everything about this phone. It's amazing. Most of all: IT'S STABLE! I switched from Android after having 3 Android phones (DroidX, DroidX2 and Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and I couldn't be happier. Windows Phone is faster, has higher quality apps, and is far, far, far more stable and easy to use than any Android phone. There are some apps missing from the Store that I used on Android, but most already have 3rd party replacements or are scheduled to be released in 2012 (Like Spotify, Instagram, and Pandora for example). Instead, I have apps like Xbox Music, which I've found to be a fantastic replacement for Spotify. The app is cleaner, has a huge music library, and syncs instantly with my Windows 8 PC. I've found that Nokia Maps is REALLY great now that the Nokia Lumia 920 has received an update since it's release. Having free GPS on my phone was a requirement to switch and Nokia nailed it. I don't even miss Google Maps anymore. I still have common apps like Evernote, Glympse, Skype, and of course Angry Birds. I even have a third party Google Mapps app to find my Android friends on Latitude. So even popular Google services are available in some fashion. But between the apps and the Xbox games, the AWESOME battery life with LTE (I NEVER had that on Android!!!), Wireless Charging, and incredible camera: There is nothing about this phone not to enjoy. I can only point out that it's heavier than other smartphones as a negative. But when you're talking weight in Grams, ""heavy"" is negligible.

2275,B00CQAODG4,WootBeToGod,5,30-Sep-13,False,Better Than I Expected,"I decided to get this phone after updating my iPhone 4s to iOS7. I didn't like the iOS7 update at all, and I was already ready for a change of scenery. I needed a smartphone so my choices came down to an Android phone or a Windows Phone (since I had seen the trouble Blackberry had been having). Many of my friends have Android phones and they always complain about random things going wrong with it or just a laggy experience in general. Maybe there's an Android phone out there for me, but after talking to my friends, I decided to look elsewhere. When I started reading about Windows Phone, it seemed like many of the tech review sites were mostly negative. They'd say a few nice things about a Windows Phone, but then they'd go on to talk about how it doesn't stack up to iPhone and Android phones. In my experience using my new Lumia 928, I've gotta say I only find it lacking in battery life (which may be because I've been playing with it constantly since I've gotten it. I have a feeling I'll make it from sun up to sun down once the shine wears off a bit. Pros: Windows Phone interface is clean. The live tiles are a refreshing change of pace from the boring icons that I was used to on iOS. The camera is great on this phone. If you get this phone, make sure and use the Nokia Pro Camera app. I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I can get from this phone, and I was already pretty happy with the job the iPhone 4s did. This wins hands down. Fast. I don't know how they did it, but they made this system run very smoothly and with great speed. Apps load quickly on this phone and the transition animations don't feel like they are covering up lag like other phones I've used. Nokia Apps. Nokia did a really good job of creating apps that make this experience a great one. Nokia Pro Camera, Nokia Creative Studio, NOKIA MUSIC (HELLO!), Nokia Here Maps, Nokia Here City Lens, etc are really great, high quality apps that make this phone stand out over even other Windows phones. Cons: Learning Curve. If you've never had a smartphone before, I don't think the learning curve will be too bad. A lot of the interface is very intuitive. However, coming from iOS, I had to give myself a good 2 days of getting familiar with the phone before my head stopped spinning completely. :) It's just a different way of doing things, and I'm glad that I stuck with it. Battery life. I'm really hoping my battery will get me through to bed time once I start using it normally like I used my iPhone. I plan to get a wireless charger for my desk at work though just in case I get in a pinch. Apps. If you like Pinterest, you're not going to find it on this phone just yet (Sept. 2013). All of the apps I used on my iPhone are on my Lumia so I'm good on that. However, if you always want the newest app on the day it comes out, you'll need to stick with iOS or Android in some cases. Don't count the Windows Phone app selection out though. YOu really should look for yourself. Wrap Up: I'm sincerely delighted to have this phone in my possession. I never enjoyed the iPhone for the 14-15 months that I had it. Don't get me wrong. The phone did just about everything I wanted it to do. I just didn't enjoy it. Using this phone is a pleasure, and it's going to take something really special from another company to pull me away from Windows Phone. UPDATE: My issues with battery life are no more! I get through the whole day with the phone now with normal use. There's some juice left over at the end of the day, but I charge it every night so it'll be full for the following day. I stream music and videos a lot on my phone, and I use it constantly at work for email and calls, so I'm really pleased to see that I get through the day with it.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

20488,B07HD3QC65,Linn,4,30-Oct-18,False,A great phone for the price currently!,"Actually I bought this phone from Best Buy with preorder. I received it on release date but I won't use it because its glass back is so slippery. So I waited until I get a case from Amazon. I chose Nokia over some other Chinese brands around $300 phones. I think I did the right thing. Very first thing I got trouble was ""4G"" icon at the top and LTE speed. We usually see literally on every phones ""LTE"" icon if we are on LTE network. But this Nokia would show only ""4G"". I am not sure it is only me. Also my data speed was about 15mbps at that time. So I chatted with Nokia rep and he asked me to do few things like clearing caches of about 20 items of system apps. After that I get speed about 45mbps on T-Mobile in central Florida which I used to get with my LG G5 or my wife's iPhone. I understand LTE is considered 4G. But still it annoyed me a bit. Phone comes with Android 8.1. Run smooth despite weak Snapdragon 636 processor. You will notice lag when you are taking video iPhone-like animoji with Camera. Also there are 1 animoji, 3 filters and few light effects currently for the built-in camera for now. I hope the more will come with updates. I don't think 3D games are going to play well on this. Actually picture quality is so good. Low light shots are even better than iPhone 7. Live Bokeh mode is not bad. But it is not as clean as iPhone X. It looks like artificial, done by software, not by lens. Google Lens is built in into Camera app and it works great. Screen is really good. Vivid and accurate for LCD. But when I put it side by side with my old LG G5's OLED, then I see the difference. But can't complaint for $350 phone. I found the gesture ""Swipe Fingerprint for notification"" I like it. Because I would hate if I have to use 2 hands to pull notifications down from the top of the screen. LG phone can be customized button at the dock for it. It is very useful for large screen phones. Battery life is OK so far. Quick charge works. What I don't like ; (1) You have to remove SD card if you want to use second SIM. (2) Doesn't show Quick-charge status at notification bar like Samsung or LG , so I wouldn't know if cable or adapter is broken quick-charge function right away. It shows on Lock-screen and disappeared after 2 seconds. So I do not know it is functioning or not. (3) Official case will have to wait until December? (4) No water-resistant in 2018. (5) Music Player (Google's Play Music App is suck) Overall this is a really good phone for the price. Can't wait to get Android 9 update. And this is Nokia quality. 2018 Chinese Brand phones are look nice. But for the long term, usually they don't function as you would expect. I have seen those a lot with my friends. I will update if I see something strange in the future. * (1 week later) Camera bump is huge. Even with a case, it is still higher than thickness of the case. I already have 3 scratches on camera lens. Now I am super annoyed by it. Now I have to find a thicker case which will protect camera lens. Android Play Music App is truly suck. I am used to LG, HTC, Sony all music apps are great. Free App Musicolet player is not bad. So far it is OK. Call quality is clear. But speaker phone mode is not that loud. I use bluetooth on my car, so it does not bother to me. Battery life is really good. To be translated to another language by Google lens AI, I have to install Google Translate app, then it will appear Translate menu when you select text from an image you shot. Before that I did not see the menu. Or may be I am doing it wrong. But it is working great. I am happy with it. 11/27/18- updated Android Pie.

It comes preloaded with features such as the Cortana digital assistant, which is the Lumia version of Apple's Siri or Google Now, that lets you talk to the phone and ask it questions or ask it to remind you about things. The Windows operating system runs really well, it's very nippy as you move around the various menus. The live tiles are a nice feature, they change to display different information, so for example photos from your contacts or the latest news. There isn't a front facing camera but you do at least get a good rear facing camera which produces decent photos for the price considering it's just a 5MP camera. It can also handle games, you can see it has no problem with the racing game in the video. For the price you get a really good mobile, one that is far better than Android phones at this price.

2273,B00CQAODG4,G. Nicklaus,5,30-Oct-14,False,Extraordinary phone for the extraordinary price!,"I bought this phone off of Verizon prepaid and have loved it since day one of getting in the mail! I think that this phone is one of the best of the Windows Phone OS because of the specs that it has is enough to get everything done in blazing speeds while also not sacrificing battery life at all. Speed (10/10) I rate this phone a 10 in the speed category because of the great making of the OS (Windows Phone 8.1 DP) It has the perfect amount of RAM (1 GB) and it has a pretty fast processor as well (1.5 GhZ dual-core) This is a great combination because it doesn't even need this much specs to run smoothly, granted having 1gb of RAM gives you more choice in the app store in terms of games. Gaming (10/10) I am not rating this in terms of choice of games in the app store, I am rating this in terms of the smoothness of the games that you can get. Every game that I have for this phone, including Asphalt 8: Airborne which is a very high graphic racing game, runs extremely smooth. I have not ran into an extreme frame rate drop at all in any game that I have played on this phone. Sound Quality (9/10) The sound quality on this phone is amazing, even without the Dolby audio enhancing feature. My only problem with the Dolby enhancing is the quality of it at high volumes. It makes the music sound a little worse after 20 volume. I love it at any other volume. The sound quality through the speaker is extremely loud at the highest volume but it loses it's clarity around the 15 mark. It is nice for speakerphone and I have no problem hearing them. Call Quality (10/10) I have only had one phone call on this phone because I am mainly a texter. I have to say though... The noise cancellation for my side is amazing! I was in a moving car on a highway and the other person didn't have any problem hearing me at all. The sound quality for receiving was great as well. I didn't have any problems hearing them. Display (10/10) This is a 720p phone but I can never tell the difference between a 720p and a 1080p phone so 720p is perfect for this phone to keep the price down. The blacks on this phone are literally pitch black and gives off no light at all which is one of the features that this phone provides. The other colors are extremely vibrant and that works perfectly with the design of the Windows Phone 8.1 OS Camera (10/10) I have to say... This is one of the best phone cameras I have ever had. The 8.7 mp sensor is amazing. It captures all of the colors and produces them beautifully. The xenon flash makes it a great night time camera and it even captures light pretty well without the flash. The native camera app, Nokia Camera, is the best camera ever and even beats all of the camera apps you can get on Android. The lenses, which are just separate camera apps, are amazing in their own parts. They can do as much as create a 360 degree photo or do as little as have more filters to choose from in live time.

20496,B07HD3QC65,CactusJack,3,30-Nov-18,True,Decent phone - solid 3.5 stars,"First off, I'm not a Tech Geek so I apologize up front if my terminology seems a bit simplistic, but IMO a fair review doesn't need to be laced with verbiage and terminology aimed to impress industry specialist, but rather articulate enough for the common man (me) to understand and assist in making an informed decision. Hopefully this review will help you when it comes to making your next cellphone choice. Why Nokia? I've been a Samsung guy for the past several years; specifically my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and more recently my Samsung Galaxy J7. I went with Nokia this time because i ran into some issues with my last Samsung and this Nokia was advertised to offer most of the features I was interested in at a price point I was comfortable with (most notable feature dual SIMM capable). At around $350, this Nokia gives me a fingerprint security feature (more on that in a moment), a 12MP camera, a solid construction frame, slim size and most importantly to me; Dual SIMM capable. Other notable features, 64GB of storage, 4Gm of RAM and the ability to support up to 400GB of SD storage!!! It's also claiming to use Corning Gorilla glass,....impressive. But what does all that really mean. Well let me give you a glimpse into the day-in-the-life with me during my normal usage. I work as a marksmanship instructor and trainer. I work out of the country often and need a phone that could operate on GSM and allow me to keep my stateside SIMM installed (I use AT&T and T-mobile while home). This phone allows that. While Overseas I use Orange, Zain, Roshan and Afghan Wireless networks and have seen no issues using any of those networks thus far. My biggest complaint, the SIMM tray also doubles as your MicroSD card tray, so Technically, if you want to use Dual SIMM capability you have to forfeit additional SD card storage. During training I take both photos and video during the day to assist in helping students identify mistakes. The camera and video quality are quite impressive, clear crisp shots and video that accurately show techniques and forms the students are expected to learn and demonstrate. Generally I can run this phone most of the day because battery life has kept up with my activities during the day; creating photos/video, sending text, messaging, surfing the net and navigating by way of GoogleMaps. I also use it as my alarm clock and even sometimes as a stop watch. The phone has performed as expected without fail. Here's my reason for 3.5 stars. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone below the camera. Once set up it works wonderfully, but during the month I've owned it I find myself having to re-set it up every 7-10 days. It will stop recognizing my fingerprint. So, I go into the settings, erase my logon, reset my fingerprints and use the feature until it fails again. Thankfully it has redundant security features so when my fingerprint no longer works I can simply type in my pass code, but IMO if a feature is highlighted as cutting edge, then it should work at least 90% or higher of the time vs. the 50% I'm currently experiencing. Is it a deal breaker; No. But certainly a disappointment. I can say the phone produces vibrant colors so viewing just about anything on it is both pleasing and impressive. The controls and settings are pretty easy to learn; if you've owned a smartphone anytime in the past two years, you should easily be able to pick this Nokia up, program it and get on with you business in under 10 minutes:-) The construction of the phone feels very solid, however it does not have a removable battery (not sure I'm a big fan of that) but I do like the solid feel of it in my hand and on my belt when carried in it's pouch. On that note, there are not a lot of options as of this review for phone cases yet. As you can see in my photo, I have a nice quality RUIHUI flip case to envelop mine and it works quite well. The belt holster I use for this phone is actually for a NUU G3 smartphone - AGOZ. You can read about that in my review on it. Bluetooth works very well as I have transferred to a number of other devices flawlessly including my Samsung Galaxy Tablet A and my Lenovo Yoga laptop as well as my older Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I use several different Headphones/earbuds with it thru Bluetooth as well and no issues there either. The Wifi receiver/chip seems to be pretty substantial as well since I can see a number of available networks on it that I cannot see on my other devices. I also tested this on my home network to see if it could work with my Sonos Home stereo system. Worked like a charm:-) Although not yet installed, I have ordered a tempered glass screen protector for it to give me even more protection over the installed gorilla glass and I've ordered a secondary clear case for it to use in my SUV with a dashboard mounting device. Those will be discussed in more detail in subsequent reviews. So, overall, I like the phone, it's features and ease of use. Battery life is impressive, phone speed is adequate for my usage and I'm pretty pleased with the purchase. The fingerprint recognition is a disappointment that its so finicky, but the phone still has security features installed to keep your content secure. Oh and I almost forgot, Phone calls, messenger calls, wifi calls over it work very well:-) Not a bad job Nokia",19.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

Just like how a car enthusiast would probably never consider a Hyundai, don't even look at this phone if you're a phone enthusiast. This Nokia is just like a Hyundai is in 2018 - it handles everything an average user might care to throw at it with ease, it comes with a brand name that most people aren't ashamed of, and it performs well enough in day-to-day use that you don't feel like you're using bargain basement junk at any point. The only feature of this phone that isn't like a Hyundai's is in the operating system. There, its more like a Mazda or BMW - The user experience offered by AndroidOne is top notch. I recently got the Android Pie update and it is slick, user-friendly, fast and the battery life is very good - 5 to 6 hours of screen-on time is what the battery monitor shows, and practically it means I get all day battery life very comfortably. The guaranteed security updates for 3 years, and OS updates for 2 years take the cake. Physical build-quality is good, but the lack of good cases is a big minus. The official Nokia case is decent. Dual-SIM capability was a must for me, and this is one of the handful of phones sold in the US which offers that. Keep in mind that you can't have 2 SIMs and an SD card at the same time.

I had a Windows phone several years ago and liked it but I had a few issues with it and upgraded to an Android phone. After two android phones I thought I might try a Windows phone again with a much better operating version, Windows 8 or 8.1. I bought this phone as a ""refurbished"" unit. About two weeks after I received it the USB port failed so I had to buy a QI charging back so I could continue to use the phone (I already had a QI charger). I bought a spare battery at the time of Amazon order to make sure I had at least one good battery available. Overall the the phone had been a good buy. I have also changed to a Windows 8.1 computer some the process was a little easier using the similar OS. I follow the Windows 10 news each week, looking forward to a final public release of W10. I am not sure I will make it to the W10 release before I will want or need to upgrade again. I think Microsoft needs to speed up the release if possible. I am sure a lot of people are getting tire of waiting on a new OS, especially in the Windows Phone area. If MS will help developers port apps from Android or iPhone to Windows universal apps, that will be a good selling point for the windows Phone world. So far I am not willing to try the Windows 10 developers preview software mainly because of the broken USB port. The USB port would be needed if I needed to go back to the current 8.1 software.

2300,B00CQAODG4,Bud Porter-Roth,3,30-May-13,False,"Good Phone, Poor Support","I purchased a Nokia 928 two weeks ago. I have a POP 3 email account that I connect to. I have 2 email accounts that I check. I check email on 2 laptops, 1 tablet, 1 phone. I found after a week that the Nokia 928 was deleting the emails from the server and that I could not get those emails on my other devices once deleted on the server. (My 3 year old HTC Droid did not do this) I called Verizon service who did not understand the problem and started reading to me from the manual, which I had and read prior to calling. I told him I had already read that and did he have a secondary source of reference. He said no and determined that the problem was with Nokia. He didn't ask any questions or offer to troubleshoot the issue. Instead, he gave me Nokia's number and didn't offer to guide me or stay with me or asked me to get back to him - sort of like, ""It's not my problem, see you later."" Excellent support Verizon and excellent support training. BTW, the Nokia 928 is Verizon's flagship product. You would think they would be more interested. I called Nokia who listened, didn't understand the problem, and said it was not their problem and sent me to Microsoft. Again, Nokia expressed no interest in my problem or the fact that I was having a problem and no questions about the issue. Nokia gave me Microsoft's number, which as it turns out is a general support desk number for Windows 8. I had to go through two transfers to get to the right group. Microsoft listened and said it was not their problem and sent me back to Nokia. I said no, it was a software problem and Nokia said they didn't make the software. I went through the problem again and the person didn't try to ask me questions or do any other troubleshooting. I was sent to another phone support number in Microsoft that turned out to be ""Supplemental Parts"" support and the guy said sorry he couldn't help me, didn't know why I was sent to that number, and didn't know who I should call. It appears that Verizon can't technically support the Nokia 928 and faced with a support issue it doesn't understand, it blamed Nokia without actually knowing it was or was not. As the primary support for its products, I would expect Verizon to take charge of the problem and get back to me with a solution instead of making me responsible. I'm not sure that Nokia or Microsoft are responsible for direct support to a customer for a Verizon product but I expected more from them in terms of analysis or troubleshooting. Not one of the three companies offered any real support that one would expect. This all took about 45 minutes of me having to make the calls and get shuttled back and forth. I finally called Verizon back and said I want my old phone back, which they did. I am very disappointed in the whole support experience and expected much more. It seems that for Verizon, Nokia, and Microsoft that support is not a critical element in the customer lifecycle and if you have one or two disappointed customers, it is cheaper than offering real support staffing.",9.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

No idea, never owned one! It is better, way better than some Android phones I have owned but I am sure as good as the current higher end Android, it just depends on your personal preferences.

FM Radio works well too with headphones inserted. It is a very simple phone, great for kids, elderly or like me, looking to ""Detox"" yourself from senseless scrolling on a smart-phone. Con's - Changing the volume isn't very intuitive. You have to go through quite a few steps to get the volume turned down. It is quite easy if your listening to audio.

It obviously doesn't have the most powerful processor, but it runs Android 7.1 quite smoothly, if not as speedily as phones with better specs. I've heard complaints that it lags, but it's not enough to bother me in the slightest. My only previous experience with Android is with a couple of small tablets over the years (Nexus and Amazon Fire), and this thing runs circles around those. Even with the cost of adding a Micro SD card, it's a huge bargain. I replaced my aging Windows 10 phone with this Nokia, added the Microsoft launcher, a 64GB memory card, and a few apps that I need, and I'm ready to roll. The fact that it's Nokia was a huge selling point for me. Even though the phones are made by HMD Global, I'm sure Nokia wouldn't put their name on crap. When you pick it up, you can just tell that it's well made. It feels solid in the hand, with just enough heft. And from what I've read, Nokia will be rolling out Android updates as they're available, unlike a lot of other manufacturers.

22358,B07N11SM58,M.L.,1,30-Jun-19,True,Kind of pointless,"Quite possibly the worst phone I bought in the last 5 years. Like many others I bought this phone for the camera but was left massively underwhelmed by it's performance, and totally disappointed by almost everything else about this phone. While the 5 camera set up allows for almost HDR like results in terms of lighting for all pictures, the details of the pictures actually are not much better than other phones on the market. You would imagine this set up would blow everyone else out of the water but it turns out to be very mediocre. Not only that, in low light situations this phone is an absolute joke. First, despite the 5 camera setup, it is just as terrible in low light as your average low budget smartphone. Second, the flash actually doesn't work. The camera actually is not synced up to take the shot when the flash actually lights up. So even though you get blinded by the flash when you decide to use it, the phone only takes the shot like 5 seconds later, and all your pictures with the flash on actually are pitch black. The battery life, even considering this 5 camera setup, is a joke. With the camera app on my battery was draining about 1% every minute, probably more. What use is a five camera set up if the phone is dead all the time? The finger print sensor in the screen is also unusable. It doesn't with most of the time, it doesn't work half of the time, it just doesn't work. I'm fairly sure I dented my screen using the sensor. No matter how you position your finger or how firmly you press, it never reads. So all in all, the phone sounds exciting on paper but a complete nightmare when you actually run it day to day.

2359,B00CQAODG4,A. Clark,3,30-Jun-13,True,My first dance with a Windows phone,"The 928 didn't live up to all the rave reviews here and on Verizon's site, in my experience. I sent back my glossy little white 928. Well, not little, it's big, and heavy. Too much. With a case this thing flopped around like a mini brick in my pocket, and the sharp corners made taking it out of my front pockets about as easy as taking well-used bubble gum out of your pocket. Didn't like the three buttons on one side, at all, and I pressed that @#$% camera button accidentally more times than I can say. Had lots of candid shots of my toes and the living room and blurry who knows what, but luckily they automatically downloaded to sky drive so I had to go delete them there also. Actually, I know it is handy to have them automatically backed up like that, but only if you don't mind everything getting backed up. I love the idea of a designated camera button, but it really should be some small, round button near a top corner or something. Or, maybe it's just how I hold a phone, but the three button setup on one side didn't work for me. Also, keyboard (and it's all you get) doesn't have a way to enter numbers on the main board..you have to go into a second screen for numbers, then back to the other screen for letters. This became really frustrating as so many emails, passwords, not to mention texts and emails have plenty of numbers and letters thrown in there. Keyboard autocorrects decently well, but is still lacking in several ways. It was much like the OS in general..very fluid and uncluttered, but over-simple not always in a good way. The good: low light camera..they tout this for a reason, but, for me anyway, doesn't make a phone in and of itself. Live Tiles are different..I think many will like the kind of mosaic, visual page they create (I did), while others will miss their static droid and iphone screens and think the windows phone looks chaotic. Live tiles often don't update quickly enough to be very useful (say, battery percentage, for one), but overall kind of different and fun. OS does work fluidly with most apps, which is nice. Email like gmail and yahoo worked well with the built in email app, loved it. However, it's sort of a take it or leave it OS and app store, very much like iOS, though of course Apple has a vast app store. If you like Windows Phone ok, then great, because that's it. No notifications, which Windows Phone will probably fix as it's just become too much a part of people's other smartphone experiences: ESPN news or scores for your favorite team, say..no go on the windows phone. Or just having all your notifications at a glance on one page. Again, some won't mind, but for others very frustrating. I'm not a social media fiend or even hard core phone user, and I still missed my notifications (and a notification light on the front, which 928 does not have) As much as I wanted to try something different, it was hard not to keep getting the sneaking feeling my phone was behind the time, by at least a year if not more. Obviously some don't mind and want something different enough that they're willing to wait it out as Windows throws money at developers to at least get the 'normal' stuff out in Windows apps. Not to say 928 doesn't work quickly..no problem with speed and whatnot..then again I fully expect that of any new phone I get. Battery life..so so. And the phone ran hot way too often for my comfort. On the plus side, wireless charging is available for this phone and is an awesome feature. IMHO, that should be universal for all smartphones today, but alas no. Also, despite battery life being mediocre (and no ability to swap batteries like you can with the galaxies, for example) I will say it charged quickly. It was nice to be at about 20% and get most of it charged back up in about an hour. That's great. I just found myself not enjoying my 'phone experience' as days went on..the shape and heft, the button placement, the concessions you need to make (just being able to change your tiles from red to mauve does not mean customization in my book). I also had what I assume were SIM problems, but I don't know how much to blame on the phone. A couple times texts would not go through, then suddenly would later in the day. On first activation it took a long time and several attempts to reseat the SIM to get it working. Later, a couple times my phone went dead and would not turn on, then magically after minutes or hours would just turn on by itself. Not confidence-inspiring, and unfortunately you just don't have the luxury of seeing whether things work themselves out as time goes on. Worthy of note here: if you need to return your contract upgrade phone via amazon, do it as quick as you can. I returned it within the 14 day Verizon mandate, but of course after shipping time, processing time, etc., it was past the 14 day, and Verizon makes you jump through some hoops. I called both customer services..Verizon will treat you like a bit of second class citizen if you don't buy through their store, so be ready. Amazon cell phone cust service was great however, and I had to call them a couple times before finally getting my upgrade date reset by Verizon. You will have a few more do-it-yourself moments if you purchase through another vendor like Amazon, BB, etc., but price usually makes it worth it (for me anyway)..just be ready to have a bit of hassle here or there perhaps. Again, AMazon service (the specific cell phone folk) were friendly and helped a good deal and even will help you activate your old phone if you wish now that you've had to send your new one back..the worst of it was some waiting and some being put on long hold, which is sort of part of the deal. Anyway, wish I could have loved the 928 as much as I wanted to, but didn't feel comfortable thinking of 2 yrs with the phone. For the price, super..I think that is what has them getting a ton sold, which is smart on their part. Overall that can only help both Nokia and Windows Phone, but, again, we're looking down the road a bit to see the benefit.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

13967,B071ZDQ6MV,CRISTIANO M BREUEL,4,30-Jul-17,True,Exceptional value,"I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown: Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far. I always have 30% left at the end of the day, even with a lot of Maps navigation, video conferencing, video streaming and other heavy usage. Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models. Software: just pure, unadultered Google Android, so just as good as a Nexus. Too early to tell about update speeds, but the fact that this is highlighted on their web site is encouraging. Screen: contrast is not as good as an OLED, but overall I hardly notice the difference. In general, just pretty good. Camera: not as good as my Nexus 6P, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me. Fingerprint reader: there are pros and cons to the position, but I get a lot more misses than with the 6P, probably because of the narrow shape. Performance: you can notice a little bit of lag in some very CPU-intensive screen transitions, but in general it's very smooth and pleasurable to use. So overall, I'm very happy with my choice so far, and not really missing anything from my previous phone. I should probably note that I got the version without the Amazon ads. I don't know if they have any noticeable impact on battery or performance, but I would definitely opt for the ad-free version unless you literally don't have the 50 bucks to spare. Edit 2017-09-06 I'm removing one star due to the issues I've had with the camera after some more intense use: - Camera often takes a while to start, sometimes more than 10 seconds - Shutter lag is also often long and inconsistent, resulting in missed opportunities and blurred photos - I experienced a serious bug with video recording: a couple of videos I recorded were corrupted and resulted in less than a second of footage - Photos highlights are very blown-out, white balance is not great and a lot of detail is lost, especially when lighting is not ideal",16.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

2276,B00CQAODG4,AshertopiA,4,30-Jul-13,False,The Best Windows Phone / A Top (Any OS) Phone,"This is the second WP8 phone I've used (the first also being a Nokia Nokia 822, Black (Verizon Wireless)) and I've been blown away by the stability and smoothness of the OS. I've run this now for just over a month and only had to reset (power + down volume) 3 times when the OS froze after I asked too much. And I tried to hang the OS! Contrast this to iOS and Android where resets are normative, particularly on Android. Here are my observations: +Verizon's LTE blazes on this phone. I've run up to 8 other devices off of Hotspot and each device has run at multiple MBPS simultaneously. On tests, I've been routinely in the 6-10 MBPS down AND upload speeds. That's faster than most home networks. And unlike cable, which can peak higher, this service was consistent all times of the day. +Nokia's apps are the best. Here Drive+ (plus is free on Nokia phones) is a great driving app and works as good or better than iOS or Google's options. Here City Lens is an amazing app that adds augmented reality to your camera view - say you want to see where you can eat around you. Hold up your phone, select this app, and all the possibly destinations show up on your screen in the direction you are looking. If you find the one you want you can select it and then navigate to it. Nokia also does a great job of filling app vacuums with their own versions of the apps; they create third party apps like CNN, Groupon, FIFA 13, ESPN Fantasy Football, and so on. +The camera is amazing at 8.7 MP and looks even better thanks to the lenses. Nokia and Microsoft's camera apps make this already impressive camera even better. It can do everything that iOS, Android and even Blackberry 10 can do and most of it better. Panorama, Nokia's Cinemagraph (it makes gif like images where you select which parts of the photo to animate), Smart Shoot, and Photsynth are very well done apps all done by Microsoft and Nokia. Photo adjustment apps thrive with the great camera. The free Fotor is great for editing as well. +The OS is smooth, doesn't hang, doesn't freeze and multitasks as good as or better than any of the other OSs. +The Xbox integration is great. I love the games available and I love that many have Xbox achievements. If you are in to Xbox you'll want this. I can't tell you how many hours I played Shuffleboard to get the last achievement! I love Carcassonne, Civilization Revolution, and many of the Microsoft exclusive games available. +Almost all the apps I need are available on WP8. Facebook, Evernote, LinkedIn, Twitter, My Fitness Pal are all first party apps. Other companies have done a fine job of bringing over other apps until the official ones are made. So I still have access to Pinterest, Wordpress, Vine, Google Play Music, Instagram, and my banks. +I love the integration in the ME tile with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. It gives me quick ways to see and share with all my friends and acquaintances. -Battery life on the 928 is no better than your average Android phone. Some Windows Phones do have better battery life but not this one. However, it is not worse than any Android either. Just have a charger nearby. Especially for gaming. -Games are too expensive. Some very basic games, like Monopoly from EA, are normal price $4.99. Most of the games are free or a dollar, like all the Angry Bird and Cut the Rope games, but some are way overpriced. I expect this to change as more games come out. And to be clear, some are worth it. Plants vs Zombies is worth $4.99 and Order & Chaos is worth $6.99 (same as on the other OSs.) -Some obscure apps are not yet available. I really miss Sketchbook Pro (Android) for drawing, but the very well done Fresh Paint app by Microsoft is great for painting. -As of this review, there aren't a ton of great protection options. I've used three different cases and none are as good as an Otterbox. I spoke to an Otterbox rep this week and they were unclear when one would be coming. They don't historically make Nokia cases. But as this phone model continues to sell and Nokia gains back market share I expect this to change.

1644,B00A2V7BA4,Ed Luhrs,5,30-Jul-13,False,"First the 900, Now This","I wrote about this phone on one of my blogs, but let me add some words here, since I reviewed the 900 months ago. First, the 920 fits fine in a jean or pants pocket. It is not too heavy or big. It is sturdy. My friend got the 928, which is lighter and looks nice. Another friend is getting the 1020. I almost guarantee I'll never meet anyone with a 925, though it is gorgeous. All these models are Nokia and all great. All in all the 920 really feels like a 900 with a much nicer screen and camera. The camera and video both live up to the hype. The DEDICATED CAMERA BUTTON is one of the things that make Windows Phone great. I'm just writing this for those combing through online opinions before making a decision. You should be commended. Most people let phone salesman rope them into getting a Samsung. Android is great. I'm not taking sides here. All I am saying is if you are reading reviews, take the next step. Get someone to show you a plugged in model at a store. Use the info you've gained from research and start poking at buttons. Take it from there. Whatever you do, tell the phone salesman to walk away if they begin to annoy you. So often it is that they know very little, yet have so much to say. I should probably say a few more things about why I give the 920 five stars. The main reason is Nokia. I dig the design language of Windows Phone immensely, but it is quirky and still has faults and little inconveniences. I knew that and decided 100% to stick with it. More reasons: Office/Skydrive integration (I use this all the time for my work at a community college and for poetry readings); really nice map/HERE Drive+ GPS integration (even easier if you download a shortcut to the vanilla Bing map interface in the Store); great battery life once you tweak settings; smooth running efficient OS; live tiles and calendar are cool; once again, DEDICATED CAMERA BUTTON; pretty tile colors... listen, I just like the thing. I'll stop, but just one more point - the way Bing, maps, local search, audio search, barcode search, and song search are all integrated is astounding. You can even use the camera to translate things.

15318,B075FL4H89,Uncle Harry,5,30-Jan-19,True,"Excellent, if you don't expect a smartphone!","I have been using this phone as my main cell phone for 9 months. I was formerly an Android user, and wanted to get away from smartphones. Overall, I've been very happy with this phone. The ringer is loud, speakerphone is loud, and call quality is solid. Besides phone calls, I do some texting. I find the T9 texting with predictive text to be fairly quick, once you get the hang of it (sometimes VERY quick!). Sure, it's not as fast overall as a smartphone keyboard, but I like that, because it makes me not want to text all the time! In my life, I want texting to be limited to short messages conveying important information, such as ""traffic - running 15 minutes late."" I don't want to carry on long, involved conversations via texting. I prefer to talk on the phone for that. I like some of the other features of the phone, and find them quite usable. The mp3 player is fine, and even supports a playlist. I've used it on many morning hikes (I put a 2GB card in the phone and carry plenty of songs), and have often used bluetooth to connect the phone to bluetooth speakers and car stereos. The sound quality is great. My only complaint would be that the interface is slow inside the mp3 player. That might be because I am using an external card with many songs - I'm not sure. I sometimes use the stopwatch, countdown timer, basic calculator, and flashlight. They are all solid. I didn't expect the camera to be great, and it's not. But it has come in handy a number of times when I was in a store and wanted to take a picture of a product or product label for later research. If the lighting is bad, however, it's hard to get a shot that isn't blurry. Even good shots don't look great on the little phone screen, but when I upload them to a computer using a usb cable (very simple to do) they look much better. Here's what I wish was better about the phone: (1) When texting, I wish there was a way to save words in a custom dictionary. For example, if I want to spell an ethnic name, I can't use predictive text - I have to choose one letter at a time. And then the next time I want to use that name, I have to do the same thing again. I wish I could save the name in a custom dictionary that the phone would later use as part of predictive text. (2) There is no notepad type app. Yes, the keypad would make typing long notes impractical, but it would be handy to be able to save some simple notes on the phone. I end up texting myself, which isn't ideal. (3) The phone ""times out"" very quickly, turning the screen off while I am pausing to think. For me that means when I press a button to turn it back on, I am at the lock screen. I like a lock screen to prevent"" butt dialing,"" but I wish I could increase the time before the screen turns off. (4) There is no way to remove the bloatware games, which I have no use for. Despite those limitations, I'm very glad I bought the phone. It does what I need it to do, is well constructed, and doesn't use much battery. I didn't mention the 3G data support, because I can't get it to work on my cell company's network in my city. This is the network's fault, though, not the phone's. But I don't need the data features, anyway. Consider your needs and expectations carefully!

1702,B00A2V7BA4,W. Frame,5,30-Dec-12,False,Benchmark Phone,"If you are in the market for a smart phone and are not bound to Apple or Google's ecosystems, Windows Phone 8 and the Nokia Lumia 920 is a great choice. The operating system: Love the live tiles. Many features (e.g. Facebook) are tightly integrated with the OS itself. I would not be happy going back now that I am used to many of these features. The hardware: Rock solid. I came from an iPhone 3GS. I regularly used an iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 from my family and co-workers. The iPhones are getting 'prettier', but when your new iPhone takes a tumble, there's a good chance you will end up with some pretty cracks. The Lumia 920 reminds me of the old iPhone 3GS - sure, it's a bit heavier than other phones, but this is more than justified by the durability. I personally enjoy a solid device device with enough heft to know you have it in your hand or pocket - I see the weight as a neutral or positive, particularly over the iPhone 5, which is too light IMHO. The screen: Arguably the best or one of the best out there in the North American market. The iPhone feels tiny in comparison. The camera: Excellent. Great manual controls, the best low-light performance you can get in a phone. Rivals any other phone camera out there. The automatic controls seem to have a little trouble in bright light, I suspect this will be resolved in an update. The app ecosystem: Decent. This is the one sore spot - certain apps aren't available for the Windows Phone 8 OS yet. Fortunately, it isn't set in stone; with brisk sales and an easy path to port applications from Windows 8, this will be changing quickly. I haven't run into any show stoppers - you can find comparable apps for the most part. On the plus side, tight integration with Microsoft software (SkyDrive integration, OneNote, etc.) is a huge help, and Nokia's fantastic apps (e.g. Drive) set it apart from other Windows 8 phones. On the whole, I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to pick up a smart phone who isn't deeply tied to Apple iOS or Google Android ecosystems.

22331,B07N11SM58,Popageorgio,5,30-Apr-19,True,"Its a Great Phone with an Amazing Camera, Useless finger print reader","I'll start of the review that there is no hope for the in-screen finger print reader and especially if you have a screen protector. they should have just stuck with a normal one on the back or none at all. I was sort of frustrated at the phone at first with the way finger print scanner was working and the camera performance at first and was about ready to return it. But when I started reading about the camera and phone itself and how the hardware and software works i was able to start taking some amazing pictures and stills. I dont believe another phone could take a better pictures then this phone in a well lit area unless your looking in the 1k$ area and they would just be slightly worse or slightly better. The patch they came out in april makes the face recognition for security really fast and camera software is much faster and easy to use. I havent had any issue with crashing as of yet which people mention in some reviews since the april patch. software and screen are top notch and battery is about normal for a phone this size. For a guy that didnt really know what he was getting into when buying this phone but after about 4 days and a lot of experimentation with the camera and software I have became a fan. Essentially you are buying a medium\high grade phone with last year hardware with an amazing camera and a broke thumb print scanner. Is the phone worth 600$? I would say yes.

At the beginning they told me that the phone was shipped back to me and I should check with FedEx in Dallas. When I asked about a tracking number, they changed the story.

2467,B00CS2ZWKQ,Parka,4,3-Sep-13,False,"Great hardware, but Windows Phone needs improvement","Update: I've updated this review as of 7 April 2014 after an OS update. I was previously an Android phone user and recently decided to give the Lumia 925 a try. I don't have any complaints with the hardware as it's a really well made phone. I'm reasonably satisfied with the phone. My main issues are all related to Windows Phone OS and apps. Let me go through everything though. - Design - The phone is thin and looks really sleek. Fonts and pictures look sharp on the 768 x 1280 pixel resolution display. The display seems very close to the surface and it looks really good. Readability is good under the glaring sun. The screen is optimized for black background. When the screen is black, it blends with a black coloured phone nicely. Power button, unlike other phones, is located on the right side instead of the top, and accessible by the middle finger. You don't have to use the power button though because double tapping on the screen will wake the phone from sleep. Sound quality of the speakers is good. - Ease of use - Overall, it's a simple phone to use for calling and messaging. If your contacts are stored with Google, you'll be able to download them and store them in the phone. User interface is generally snappy. Applications open fast, and if they are slow it's because of the app design (i.e. Skype). - Camera - The camera is about 28mm wide, f2, 8MP with OIS. So it's a relatively capable for taking photos in low light. Looking at comparison photos online, the image quality seems as good or better than other brands, but as with camera phones, they all have that digital feel to them. There's a dedicated physical camera button at the bottom right side for launching the camera app and taking photos. Very convenient. You can also half-press that button to focus, and full press to shoot. If you're getting a case, get one that does not cover the camera button as you'll want to feel the half press. The issue with the camera is that it's quite slow to have the camera app launched and running. This is not a camera phone where you can shoot quickly whenever you see a picture moment, but there aren't a lot of camera phones that can do that anyway. - Apps - Availability of applications is the biggest issue to note when you're switching from other OS. Windows Phones has a smaller library compared to Android and iOS. If you need certain critical applications, you will want to research to see if there's an alternative here. For me, I just use Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Skype and a couple of photography apps. For photography apps, definitely go and download Nokia Pro Cam which gives you all the manual functions to the camera. The inbuilt music player isn't terrific but works. If you've iTunes, you have to install the Nokia software to be able to import your playlists. Search is via the inbuilt Bing search button. There's a Google Seach app available. - File storage and transfers - I'm using the Lumia on a Mac. There are Nokia softwares for photos and document transfers. As far as copying (drag and dropping) a file from the desktop to phone via the USB cable, I still cannot find any good app for that. Come on, sometimes I just want to put a Photoshop file on the phone and work on it further at home, but I can't with this phone. With iOS, you can install the many file manager apps. With Android, it's plug and play. With Windows Phone, I've nothing to say. We all work with files so there really is no reason to not have such basic functionality. For files that the phone support, e.g. photos and video that the phone takes, you can install the Nokia Windows Phone software on your computer (I'm using Mac) and you can select the files to download or upload. It's a very simple software, I wished there are ways to create folders. - Email - You can set up Gmail with the phone. However, you won't get all the Gmail features like search, archive, etc. There's an unoffcial Gmail app available for download. Windows Phone syncs Gmail every 15 minutes, but syncs their Microsoft mail instantly. This could be an issue for those who use email a lot for work, and require close to instantaneous response. - Quirks - The status bar shows only the time. You have to tap it once to show battery life, internet and phone connection. There's no (aesthetic) reason why it should not show all the statuses. With most applications, if you scroll down too far, it's not easy to scroll back up. In other phones, you typically tap the top status bar to scroll up automatically. The most irritating thing of all is the phone is not smart enough to know the orientation of photos and videos taken. There are times when I take photos with the Nokia Pro Camera app in landscape mode, the photo when viewed (phone held vertically) is upside down. Sometimes, videos taken in landscape mode, when downloaded appear in vertical mode. There's no easy way to tell the orientation that is being recorded -- just because you're shooting in landscape does not mean you're recording in landscape. If there's a good reason not to buy this phone, it's this one. There also needs to be some way to show clearly (upload bar) whenever a photo or video is being uploaded to Microsoft Skydrive. All these quirks are usability quirks that can be fixed via firmware upgrades if there are any. Microsoft has already fixed quite a few quirks since the last time I wrote this review in September 2013. - Conclusion - As I've mentioned, the hardware is great but Windows Phones as an OS certainly has a lot of room for improvement. Minor tweaks really. If you're on a budget, I would suggest Google Nexus 4. I would have gone that route if that phone can be sold and shipped to my country Singapore. Personally, I prefer Android running on phones. There are some who say it's not as user-friendly, but hey, the learning curve is extremely gentle. Price is the real consideration. I've seen phones with rather similar specifications selling for less than half the price. The premium you pay for a brand oftentimes does not translate to a significantly smarter phone. I've been using the phone for a few months now. There are no terrible crashes. It's generally smooth sailing. Battery life could be better. How much time you can get out of the battery can be erratic. You'll have to charge daily that's for sure. Hardware - 5 out of 5 stars. Windows Phone OS - 4 out of 5 stars.",22.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 925 (RM-893) 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone GSM Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-RM-893-Windows-Smartphone-Unlocked/dp/B00CS2ZWKQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MoEhAZS2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CS2ZWKQ,94,0.0,0.0

3667,B00HWEMZ1E,HomeschoolMom2003,3,3-Oct-15,False,Awesome phone...but Windows too limiting,"I recently upgraded from a basic to smart phone and after reading a ton of reviews settled on this one. The main feature I was looking for was a good camera as my camera had died not long ago. This 20MP camera is AWESOME! The color is amazing and the included software makes cropping and tweaking a cinch. The video is outstanding with 4 microphones...and I can't hear myself breathing as with my old video camera. Personalization is easy and with a lot of options to choose from, I was able to replace that Verizon Red with something more pleasing to my eye. Sending and receiving calls is a breeze and the volume is great..no need to shout on speaker. Now for the reason this awesome phone has only 3 stars...The apps. I had no idea what the difference was between iPhone, Android, and Windows. They were words I had heard, but didn't know what they meant. When I saw ""Windows"" on this phone, I thought, ""My computer uses Windows, so it will be familiar...great~"" My husband uses Southern Link and the reason we upgraded to a smart phone for me is so that I could download their Push-to-Talk app so I could communicate with him at work more easily. (Also a great app if there's a disaster and the cell towers are down.) Well, Windows is so new, this app was not compatible. There needs to be an app that would translate between the 3 platforms, especially if Windows is to grow, because right now it's very limited. If it's not in the Store, you can't get it. There are many apps in the Store, don't get me wrong, but if you're looking for a specific app, it might not be there. I wanted a NKJV Bible app, but only found KJV, which I tried to download, but it stayed on ""pending"" and never progressed. After 5 days, we ended up taking this to a Verizon store and trading it in on a Droid Turbo. More expensive, but they did give us $200 credit for our Lumia Icon~ not bad! But all in all, I loved this phone, and if it weren't for the Windows incompatibility, it would be a 5 star and I would highly recommend it, but as it is, it would depend on you and your app needs.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

She adapted to it within a week and enjoys using it and seeing pictures of her grandkids and listening to some of her favorite artists. The OS is perfect for her because the tiles are big and she can easily access the weather, banking, pictures, etc. Had I gotten her iOS or Android with their small icons it would have been more of a transition for her to adapt coming from a non-smartphone flip phone. For the price it was worth it and I'm now looking to graduate her to WP8 this Xmas. The build quality is excellent as Nokia is known for that.

I originally got an 800 series Nokia Lumia phone to replace my Blackberry. How I wish I had not! The first phone was a piece of s***. It broke within less than two months and I had my BB for over 3.5 years. Verizon replaced it with an upgrade - the 928 Lumia. What a disaster and a nightmare that is continuing today. I had that phone for less than two months when the touch screen stopped functioning on a Friday morning. Verizon sent me another promising a Saturday delivery but screwed that up and didn't get the phone until Monday late. Imagine my joy at their customer service! Then the backup assistant that was supposedly saving my contacts and pictures wasn't actually doing that so I couldn't download them to the new phone and had to go to a Verizon store to have it done. I was there for two hours and they couldn't do it either. Then tonight all of a sudden the tiles changed on their own to all black, which isn't even a theme, and I had to spend hours on the phone with Verizon yet again and finally had to restore the original settings to fix it.

I bought mine from Cleartronix and everything was great, they even answer some question i did before the purchase, came fully unlocked and works great in Venezuela under Movistar, and the unlock number came inside the box. The battery life is amazing, i spend over 24 hours without charge it and still got 10% battery. I would totally recommend this phone, is really really smooth, great battery life and strong signal reception, but if you're looking for a super camera, or HD display you should spend a lot more money, this is an amanzing phone that works like a mid range and cost like a low range",4.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Unlocked-Windows-Quad-Core/dp/B00KM10ITK,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WZWpJTYmL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00KM10ITK,693,103.98,0.0

2279,B00CQAODG4,William of Orange,4,3-Nov-13,False,Amazing phone with some fatal flaws,"I recently upgraded to a Nokia Lumia 928 from an old Kin2. I really liked the Windows Phone platform because it complied with my spacial neatness of my OCD. The overall build quality is excellent and the sleek white back on mine is flawless. The phone overall is very quick and responsive and is not bogged down by access programs running in the background. This phone is very good overall but there are some serious faults though. First I'll start with the positives -The phone is very light and fits comfortably into my hand -The screen is very bright and colorful -The screen can go extremely dim, as dim as the iOS devices -The virtual keyboard is a masterpiece -The audio options are very useful, it has an equalizer that you can control with various frequencies and Dolby enhancer for headphones -Features are constantly updated and added -Wireless charging is super easy to use Now with the cons -The battery life is very short, rated at 17 hours, but actually less -Internet Explorer does not open back up to the last page you were on -After a few weeks of using this phone, during calls the speaker cuts out and I can't hear a thing. The people on the other line can still hear you talking, but you can hear them at all. It fixes itself if you knock the back of the phone on your leg, but that is only a temporary solution that you have to repeat multiple times a call. Apparently this happens because the charging port and speaker are in such close proximity to each other (basically one behind the other) that the workings get knocked around and disconnected. It only happens about 70% of the time so when I took it in, of course it didn't do it.

The colors in DNG images are extremely accurate. You will need to make slight edits, since the images are a tad dark. The level of detail is insane. Wish I could upload DNGs, but Amazon does not support raw images. JPEGs are also pretty cool. Since this phone has a depth sensor, you can play around with blurring foreground/background while editing. One thing that you should know about the camera before you buy is that since this phone (if you enabled both JPEG and DNG) processes a crapload of data when you snap a pic, processing will take up to 7-8 seconds. It does not bother me much, since I have a DSLR with a small LCD screen, which requires me to check each photo to make sure my settings are correctly locked in.

I wanted something more reliable, less app force-closes, better build quality. I was fine with the smaller app market. All I do with my phone is browse the web ,(mostly p**n), listen to music, driving navigation, and read books. You don't need millions of apps to accomplish that. When the Lumia 920 came out, I knew it would be my next phone. It had everything I wanted, there was great videos on youtube of people TORTURING this thing and it coming out relatively unscathed. Great! When my existing contract went out, I grabbed one. The Lumia 920 lived up to all my expecations. I loved the feel of it in my hand. I loved the gorgeous screen and silky animations, the rock solid stability of apps and the long battery life while not sacrificing 4g. Today I dropped my phone from 2 feet off a desk. It slipped from my hand. The smooth texture of the yellow phone probably didn't help in this matter. I'm aware that black and cyan are a textured finish, but I wanted yellow, dangit. The screen was absolutely DESTROYED. This phone is less than a month old. I am also disappointed in other aspects of of the build quality in this phone. I'm in the military, and not always in the cleanest environments. I keep the phone carefully in my pocket with no other objects and never lay it on its screen. Nevertheless, it had picked up several scratches on the screen visible by angling it in good light. Of course I can't see them anymore, since there are so many cracks and fissures on the screen. I am not always in a spotless environment, and by resting the phone on desks or tables with small amounts of dirt, the plastic casing has manged to pick up pock mark holes all over. I have two larger areas with deeper scratches, from what, I don't know. The Lumia 920 was an absolute joy for me to use. I am now deeply disappointed in the build quality and will not be replacing it with another. In a bitter kind of way, I half believe that Nokia initially released a higher quality Lumia 920, and it was eventually ramped down to the fragile blossom of a phone that I am now stuck with. tl;dr If there are any people out there considering this phone, please just take this away from my misfortune. The build quality is NOT BETTER than any other average smartphone out there. Don't consider this as a point in the Lumia 920s favor when shopping for your next phone that you want to keep for 2 years.

Nevertheless, it had picked up several scratches on the screen visible by angling it in good light. Of course I can't see them anymore, since there are so many cracks and fissures on the screen. I am not always in a spotless environment, and by resting the phone on desks or tables with small amounts of dirt, the plastic casing has manged to pick up pock mark holes all over.

978,B00836Y6B2,White,5,3-Mar-13,True,Nokia Lumia 900...an owner review for the everyday person.,"This phone is great! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it's modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it's sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it's more than enough for me. I really don't know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I'm really looking forward to using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I'm crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it's quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won't be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that's coming from a person that doesn't or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It's very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB, and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.",81.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
24714,B07QTLB1D9,Boyd Johnson,4,3-Jun-19,True,My review for the NOKIA 4.2,"I needed a budget Android Smart Phone that was well built had good battery life and a useable version of Android. And the NOKIA 4.2 has all these things. Before I go any further with this review I need to clarify a few things. I did not need or want a phone to play music all day, stream movies or play games. I needed one that was a good phone send a few texts get onto the internet when I needed to and maybe take a picture now or then. This phone can also do those other things. But will it be as good as a 1,000.00 high end smart phone probably not. But if you are looking for an entry level unlocked smart phone for 189.00 it is probably one of the best. The way I use my phone it is very reliable and has fantastic battery life. And even better the only software on it when you get it is Android version 9. This is the first android phone that I have ever owned that I can truly say is easy to use. There is no bloatware and no one has screwed up the interface. The only thing you are going to find on this phone is what you put there. The one thing I do not like is I would like to be able to make it go loader when on speaker phone. I have not done any streaming or music with it. So you will have to find a different review for that.

2406,B00CQAODG4,EuroDriver,1,3-Jun-13,False,Phone Itself is Awesome But I Had to Return It,"Preamble: The main reason (deal killer) for me is that Windows 8 phones cannot play .wav files (meaning I can't use it to listen to my email voicemails) even though the specifications on the Verizon website say it does (false advertising?). I feel bad giving this device such a terribly low rating because the device itself is quite nice however, the OS's limitations rendered it practically useless to me but if it cannot perform some very basic functions, it just becomes a very fancy paperweight. First off, let me address the phone itself: It is indeed a very attractive piece of equipment that garnered a lot of compliments in the three days that I used it. The display is amazing, its response is fast and fluid and in general it looks and feels like a solid, quality device. Coming from a Motorola Razr Maxx, I was afraid no other phone would keep me happy, as the Razr Maxx's massive battery had really spoiled me. However, I was fairly impressed with the battery capacity of the Lumia 928 which, after average use, I would end up with 50% - ~30% remaining at the end of a typical 12 -14 hour day. I also purchased the vertical wireless charging cradles which I immediately fell in love with - they make charging such an easy, convenient task. I'm not much of a cell phone photographer but the picture quality (without flash - more on this below) is stunning. Call quality is super clear and the speakers/mic certainly live up to their tasks. Now on to the shortcomings... Cons: Integrated Battery - cannot add a larger capacity battery No Memory Expansion - I really didn't mind when I bought it due to SkyDrive. However, with memory cards being so cheap, I really resent the new trend in committing your memory capacity on an otherwise extremely versatile piece of equipment. Xenon Flash - Although the camera is impressive, the xenon flash gives pictures a very yellowish tint - best to take pics without flash. Lack of Swype - Android has really spoiled me on this one (originally a Microsoft feature? and man, do I miss the physical, vertical QWERTYs - never had to look at my phone to accomplish one-handed texting on those!). Although WP8 uses word prediction, it's still not quite as practical #(wasn't it also a Microsoft product to begin with?). Lack of a Built-In Bedside App - the last few phones I have had prior to this turn the phone into a bedside clock when plugged into the charging dock. There's an available app but it's not automatic. Not a big deal, but just a slight annoyance. Last But Not Least - The OS Limitations... Fist off, as I mentioned earlier, the windows 8 phones cannot play .wav files (at least some variants). I receive my voicemails from work via email so when I'm away from the office, I get an email and immediately listen to the voicemail. First email I received, and I get a popup to the extent of ""sorry, cannot play this type of file."" I read several forums and this has been a known issue since at least November of last year and although some people have reported that Microsoft is working on a solution, I found none. I contacted Verizon, Microsoft and Nokia which they all confirmed wav files are not supported. I wasn't given any expectation of a fix, much less a timeframe. As such, I cannot use this phone or any WP8 phone for that matter (All my previous phones - every variant of a Motorola Droid has never had a problem playing my voicemail attachments). There's a couple of online services that convert the wav files and reroute the emails to you, but this did not work for me, since my faxes get emailed as well and when I tried the service, my fax messages disappeared in the cloud. A luck few have been able to get their phone providers to change they type of file extension they send out, but I had no such luck. Such a shame, because I really liked this phone. I had been waiting several years for a decent Windows phone to become available (to integrate with all my office applications for mobility) and when it finally came, it was a huge disappointment. Other than the wav files issue, Windows 8 phones cannot sync directly with Microsoft Outlook. I ended up having to set several loops through a Hotmail account, an Outlook.com account and my gmail account to get email, contacts and calendar all synced. As a result, I have double reminders on my calendar events. Even worse, when I log into Outlook.com directly, my appointments don't show! As I mentioned, I had been anticipating a phone like this for such a long time and the Lumia 928 is almost everything I wanted in a phone, but the Windows Phone 8 OS is not ready for business-oriented consumers, especially considering the basic, established functions and popularity of the lacking services. If those few issues are not a concern to you, then you might be extremely happy with the Lumia 928. I highly recommend the phone in and of itself which is a beautiful, high quality phone. Hopefully it's clear that my rant is aimed at the OS more than at the phone itself but the bottom line is, I cannot use this phone. I hope Microsoft can work out the kinks by the time my eligibility for another upgrade rolls around in a couple of years, then I might give it another try. In the meantime, it's back to Android for me.",9.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

It pains me to write this review as I was very much looking forward to this phone but unfortunately it has a number of bugs and limitations. 1. Text Messaging: Not the same as old devices. Try to type a number, hit space, and you get extra 0's. Type a period and the next letter does not automatically capitalize. Etc. 2. Flashlight turns on randomly in my pocket. No idea why, to turn it off you have to scramble to unlock the phone, figure out what setting the flashlight is under, and deactivate it. 3. As another reviewer noted, often when I pull the phone out of my pocket it has already begun dialing 911 for me. Maybe this is a feature?! 4. No ring profiles. Want to go back and forth between a good ring volume and silent? Hit 10 or so keys each way every time. 5. SMS memory extremely small. Phone tells me to delete messages. I spend money, buy an SD card, and insert it, and the phone says haha you can't put SMS on the SD card. Want to SMS? Delete messages every day for the rest of your life. 6.

It integrates perfectly with work (E-Mail, Calendar, Lync, SkyDrive,Office, etc.) and my personal life. The user experience is fluid and easy to learn. The People Hub brings all my friends, contacts, and family into an easy to follow area where through one live tile I can drill down to see my wall on facebook, updates on linkedin, etc. All of my family also got a Nokia Lumina 920 phone which includes my wife and three boys. Everyone finds it easy to use. XBOX music gives you unlimited free music for our family members by upgrading our XBOX Live family account. I have used XBOX Smartglass on my phone to control the XBOX we use for our home entertainment center using my phone to bring up playlists, Netflix, etc. We have tons of app's we have downloaded missing very view games and a few other capabilities teenagers love. You can take a snapshot of your screen on the Windows 8 phone. Nokia Drive is excellent along with the other Nokia app's. I find the one step upload of pictures to Facebook super simple. Take picture click share type message and it is posted. Don't have to open any app's to do these basic tasks. The twitter app Rowi works great. The screen resolution is excellent I do not need my reading glasses to read info on my phone. The camera works as good as my digital camera and I have it set up to upload my pictures to SkyDrive automatically. I can log on with my Windows Live ID on any device Computer, Tablet, or phone and see my SkyDrive content. I also love the wireless charging. When my phone needs charging (ever other day) I set it on my wireless charging plate and it charges. Once you use wireless charging you will never want to go without it. Good luck in making your choices there is more than enough good feedback on this phone to show it is a no brainer that this is the best phone out on the market right now. Windows 8 phone is a fantastic operating system. I have purchased a Windows 8 Surface (multiple for family and my parents) and we have upgraded our non-touch enabled PC to Windows 8. Thank you Microsoft for the innovation and market leading solutions you are providing.

1649,B00A2V7BA4,Huskerhawk,5,3-Jan-13,False,Microsoft finally did it right,"Windows 8 is really slick. I know many people hate it, and I was one who delayed converting because of the reviews and bad experiences I read about. I finally built a PC and bought a touchscreen for it, so I installed win8...and we love it. I even upgraded two more PCs and use touchpads and regular mice with those, and it's amazing. If you're scared off by the reviews, give it a try and some time to get acclimated...you won't regret it. I mention that because once you familiarize yourself with Win8, a Windows phone is a no-brainer. I've used iOS and Android...of those two, I prefer Android. But Windows8 is now my favorite. The live tiles are cool, being able to customize your home screen, re-size tiles...all very slick. The camera on this phone is great. Low-light pictures are really good. No comparison to other smartphones. In regular lighting, I think it's comparable to others, but not outstanding. Haven't shot video yet, but I understand that is another area it can excel in. The size and weight were a big concern BEFORE I got the phone. I had read the reviews and people, even those who liked the phone said the heft was a significant drawback. I had used a GS3 previously, so I was concerned that I was going to a phone with a smaller screen but significantly more ""weight"". I can tell you now that it's way overblown. The size and weight are not significant at all. It's definitely heavier but it doesn't feel disproportionately so. It has a really good feel in your hand and the weight seems to contribute (positively) to that. It's very intuitive to operate and since it's Windows-based, you just plug it in to your PC and it opens like any other drive or device in explorer. Drag and drop files between folders...very simple. The wireless charging is probably the coolest part of this phone. You just set it on the plate and it charges. I got a free wireless charger with the phone, so it's not even any extra cost right now. Now that I've had this, I wonder why every phone doesn't make this standard! So easy and cool. I bought an extra charger to take to work! The one negative you may find, especially if you are a big app user, is that there is not the volume of apps available yet for windows. I don't use a ton of them, and I was able to find either the same app or a comparable/better alternative for everything except for one. I'm not typical, probably, so consider that before you jump in. However, things like the Nokia Music app are free and you can download music for free to play on the device...you can set up your own mix or go with theirs, and then download to listen offline. Update the list occasionally and you'll get a new mix. And it's all free. All in all, I thought the GS3 was the best phone I had used when I got it last year. It's still a great phone, but now having used the Windows based phone, I think Microsoft finally got this right. The seamless integration between phone and PC is finally evident and I can't believe it was MSFT that did it...I am really impressed with this phone. UPDATE: Battery life is excellent (for a smartphone). I can get through a day at work, with normal usage (mostly texting, checking email,listening to music on the commute) using only half the battery. It seems like it really conserves battery when the screen is inactive during the night. Much better than my Samsung android phones. I used less than 5% of the battery overnight on the Lumia vs. 17%-20% minimum on the GS3 and Note. Another thing that is nice is that on my GS3 I ran Avast mobile security but on the Win8 platform programs are all sandboxed so processes can't' hijack and run when another process is running, thus better security and no need to run additional software on the phone for security. That's very nice to know as well, especially given the popularity of MSFT hacks and attacks.",6.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1651,B00A2V7BA4,Dhruv Thukral,5,3-Jan-13,False,"A Good Solid Phone from Nokia, a Business User Review","It is really good to see Nokia come out with a solid device that provides great overall value. Whether you are an iOS, Android or WP fan, what benefits us all as consumers is the presence of a healthy ecosystem of strong devices that makes the consumers in charge, rather than some snob executive or marketing guru who think they know what is best for us. I have had a windows phone for the past 4 years as my personal phone and various iPhones and Android devices as my work phones (I work in the mobile industry developing software for devices) and each has their strengths and weaknesses. I am not a fan boy of any company or device, but I understand that each of the players in the market right now are necessary for a balance in the favor of consumers (think T-Mobile's relationship to ATT & Verizon). In-fact I hope that the Blackberry comes out with a great phone this year and makes the marketplace even more interesting. Folks are just too cynical these days dissing and calling for the death of companies that don't innovate, without realizing that the fewer the companies, the worse off we are. Now for the phone itself, I have not seen a screen yet that beats the Lumia 920. While it may not be the largest, it is the best balance of size and resolution and you immediately notice it. I am for the first time, one of those users who are constantly stuck on their phone sliding, swiping, playing around with it while having lunch, drinking coffee or walking around, It really isn't healthy and I hope I can stop doing that, but for now I am hooked. I have also merged my device functions, as the Lumia is now both my personal and business phone. We run Office 365 where I work and integration with Exchange is a breeze, email and calendars work great. The keyboard is very responsive and the dictionary is probably one of the best out there. The Office Suite of apps that come standard are very useful for making simple edits and last minute fixes before important meetings (you will never use the phone to create full on doc and presentations, but if you do, more power to you). SharePoint integration works really well and makes collaboration on the go easier. Finally the Lync app is probably the best one available (the one on iOS is pretty horrible, don't know if that is done on purpose but I wouldn't be surprised) and works well over the 4G connection. Other business apps I have used are LinkedIn which works great and does pretty much everything I need it to do, Bloomberg and my Banking apps. The overall UI is very smooth and responsive and I have never had the phone freeze on me yet. I have dropped the phone a couple of times while on the go and it is still looks fine, no dents and scratches. A few cons are the battery life, the phone hasn't lasted me more than 1 and a half days without a charge(I have been using it pretty heavily, but still, for a phone at this price point, the life should be better). Another thing I have yet to figure out is if there is a way to stream content from my phone to a TV the way iPhones can do via Apple TV. That would be very useful for presentations and I hope Nokia can work with the likes of Roku etc to make this possible. Also AT&T is still horrible, so I had my phone unlocked and moved to T-Mobile and it works really well. Overall, this is a great phone and I wish Nokia all the success.

1451,B00A2V7BA4,TSDrummond,5,3-Jan-13,False,A Message to iOS and Android,"You can find thorough reviews here and elsewhere on the web. I am just going over what I like and dislike in a couple paragraphs. Most of the 920's success comes from Windows Phone 8 itself. In fact, ignoring the nifty hardware, it really is hard to justify buying one WP8 device over the other; it is that close a race. WP8 has a massive feature set, both in quantity and innovation. Rooms and groups, for example, let you gather friends, family, and coworkers into single spots, where you can e-mail or text everyone at once, or even share calendars and photos. Though I don't use these features to the fullest possible extent, a social butterfly will have a glorious time with any Windows Phone; Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks are hard-wired into the OS for quick and easy access. The 920 itself is quite the device, though; the camera is a physically-stabilized unit, which results in less blurry photos and incredibly beautiful video. To be honest, I believe the phone does a worse job with stills than with video, and I would actually reverse the rating between photo and video quality that Consumer Reports rewarded the device with. The camera seems to have focus or sharpness issues, which have improved since the last update, though they aren't entirely fixed. To redeem itself, however, the camera takes unbelievable low-light shots. It is something you have to see to believe. Go look up any comparison online. I have not used the NFC feature of the phone in any real life situation, but I have tested it and it is pretty nifty. If you have friends with Android devices that have this tool, it will work across platforms. The phone also has wireless charging, and purchases originally came with a charging plate free of charge; I don't know if that remains the case. I should tell you that it is not just some throwaway toy installed just for the sake of saying the 920 has it; it is surprisingly forgiving when you think about the situations where you plug in normally. Say you are asleep at night, and your phone is plugged into the wall when you get a call. When you answer that phone, you will either reach over, unplug it, answer it, hang up, and then struggle in the dark to get the plug back in, or just decide not to bother. Instead, with wireless charging, you would just pick up the phone, use it, then set it back down, and it would stay charged. You almost have to try it in a few situations to understand its practicality. If I had a second one downstairs, I would have my phone on it right now, but instead it just sits here on my desk because I don't want to go find a charger. A lot of people complain about the weight. It is something you get used to, period. I barely notice it when I'm holding it, other than the fact that, you know, I'm using it. I pick up my mother's iPhone 4 nowadays, and that device feels like a toy. A fragile toy, I should add. The 920 really IS a brick. It is well-built, features Gorilla Glass to resist scratches, has a full-polycarbonate body which is beautiful and eye-catching in gloss red, and, as I have found out, this phone will take some abuse to that chassis; a solid couple of drops onto rough concrete put some visible dents in the corners, but since the material is red throughout, the damage is hardly noticeable. Just be wary that no screen can take a face-first drop; not an iPhone, not a Samsung mobile, and not any Nokia, either. Software is a big deal as well. The WP8 OS itself is miraculous. Even though the dual-core processor isn't something absolutely amazing, the fact of the matter is that the OS is so well-designed that a Windows Phone does not need crazy amounts of RAM and processor capacity to function as fast or faster than any iOS or Android device. While some third-party programs lag as a result of programming, the standard apps included with the phone, as well as properly designed new downloads, blaze open. I can't remember the last time I stared at a splash screen for more than a second. I mentioned some of WP8's built-in features as well, but it is also worth mentioning that this is a Nokia, and these phones come with their own special software programs. Nokia Drive is a full and free turn-by-turn navigation application. PhotoBeamer lets you scan a QR code on your friend's phone and instantly send a photo or show an entire album on the other device without Bluetooth or NFC. Cinemagraph lets you take a short video, select an area of the video to animate and another to keep still, followed by other adjustments, and create a hybrid .Gif animation. The list goes on, and Photobeamer was even a new app, released a couple weeks after the 920 and other Nokia devices went on sale, so you can tell that Nokia is dedicated to their phones and the WP8 ecosystem. While speaking of apps, many are quick to discount the Windows Phone line because of the puny selection in comparison to iOS and Android (150k to 700k each, respectively). I did some research, and, compared to iPhone's original upbringing of its own app store, Windows Phone is seeing even greater growth within its first 2 1/2 years than iOS. Specifically, 2 1/3 years into the launch of each ecosystem (the current age of WP7/WP8), WP8 stands at 150k+ applications, while iOS had something in the neighborhood of 90-100k apps (About October 2009). As far as finding the apps I need, I have found plenty of addicting games like Physi Bricks and Tile Path, news readers like AP Mobile and BBC News, A NASCAR app better than any I ever tried on iOS (NASCAR Live), an intricately-animated weather app (Amazing Weather HD), and plenty of the usuals, such as Urbanspoon, Amazon apps, and Flixter. Considering the last 3 months produced the last 30,000 apps (again, greater growth for the same post-release time as iPhone), your favorites such as Spotify and Instagram are on the way. The phone does not get away without a few problems, however: I did believe my first 920 had a battery issue, and, upon sending it in for a repair, Nokia replaced the phone under warranty. Chat support was helpful and the shipping and repair times totaled just over two weeks, but the battery likely did, in fact, turn out bad. There have been many complaints of poor battery life, ranging from not being able to keep a good charge all day to not being able to survive a matter of hours on standby. I no longer have these problems and, without taking a single deliberate step to save battery life, my phone has gone the last 13 hours of the day down to 26% life, with an estimated 8 hours left. I power-use every now and then when I am out, using geolocation and hard LTE browsing, and I would consider myself a mid- to power-user. The battery is perfectly sufficient for me, but serious power-users who come close to running out every day on their current phones might look elsewhere for their next device. What I mean by ""Availability"" is this: either Nokia truly cannot keep up with demand, or they deliberately reduced supply to create the image of excessive demand. Whichever is the case, the phone can be hard to get, even a month and a half after it went on sale in the States. The gloss yellow and matte cyan models are constantly sold out, making the black, white, and red the general available choices for the time being, red sometimes in fewer stores, though not impossible to obtain. I also mentioned in the Cons that some apps have issues. Namely, developers of many apps did, in fact, develop while WP8 was still WP7, and the latter had several limitations to app functionality, interaction, etc. As a result, some programs fall short of typical satisfaction and performance of that of other and similar apps. Amazon programs, for example, are lackluster; the shopping program often has great difficulty finding items when the built-in Bing search on the phone has no such problem. The Kindle app also lacks a great deal of functionality; I cannot use a calorie-counting book because the program lacks a quick-search feature, which is present on nearly all other Kindle applications on other platforms and devices. And yes, several ""killer apps"" remain unported to WP8, but as I have explained earlier, it is bound to happen, and it definitely will this year. In fact, I will probably stick to other programs rather than wait for Instagram; programs like PhotoFunia, Fhotoroom, and Lomogram are great alternatives with more and creative new features in comparison. An alternative to Spotify, available on any Lumia device, is Nokia Music, which offers free Pandora-like streaming services from an 11-million-plus library with no ads. You can even save entire mixes to the phone. And the maps? It is simply the number one thing that has bothered me. Nokia's mapping apparently is popular on a global scale, while Bing's data focuses on accuracy within the United States. As a result, one's results are often not the same on the other program's, resulting in doubting both softwares entirely. Directions are iffy, unless you are using the Nokia Drive application, with issues such as not showing exact maneuvers for intersections, not indicating interstate exit numbers, and, most importantly, not providing alternate routes before navigation is started. gMaps Pro is a third-party Google-Maps-based alternative, though you must buy it, and when a company brags on how great its mapping software is only to fail to deliver, buying another program because of that is almost an insult to the user. This covers most of the bases in terms of how I use my phone. YMMV when it comes to what kinds of apps you use, how hard and often you use your phone, etc. But I do believe this: WP8 is the next truly competitive mobile operating system. Given a year, it will be contending closely with the current two kings of the smartphone business. The Lumia 920 is the flagship phone, with the most hardware and software features. While the 8X is a viable alternative, the Lumia 920 is the Windows Phone to get if you want the best.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1679,B00A2V7BA4,Will,4,3-Feb-13,False,Good phone with room for improvements,"I like this phone much better than the iPhone it replaced. It is a lot more versatile, without being so open that there is a concern about malware. The major perks are seamless integration with my Windows desktop without having to install additional software, an industry standard micro usb connector and wireless charging (with additional charger purchase). The screen is sensitive enough to use with gloves (driving gloves, not heavy gloves) but not so sensitive it causes problems. Issues: 1. Battery life is inconsistent and often way too short, sometimes the phone will last 8 hours or less with no use and sometimes it will last 14+ hours with moderate use. Turning off bluetooth etc has no effect on the battery life in this case. Once the phone turns off due to low battery it will not turn back on until it has been charging for almost 30 minutes 2. Only one volume control. This means if you turn the volume down to play a game without disturbing others, your ringer gets turned down too 3. Lack of real apps. Where most major credit card and banking companies have developed apps for iPhone and Android, almost none of them have developed for Windows Phone 4. No granular data control, and some carriers (AT&T) do not allow you to use Nokia's data monitoring app. You cannot set live tiles to only update over Wifi, nor can you restrict anything other than phone software updates. This can eat up your data plan without you realizing it. 5. Voice control is so promising but very limited, no ability to turn off wifi or bluetooth with voice, which would be very helpful in saving battery 6. Lack of an SD slot (which is slightly offset by the 32 GB capacity) 7. No wireless sync capability Other than some moderate flaws, this is a solid phone (literally and figuratively) that is a sound replacement for my iPhone.

2494,B00E45043A,InDebt4School,5,3-Dec-14,True,Great Budget Phone/ Alternative Media Device,"This review is for the entire phone even though I only use it exclusively for media purposes. I bought this device as a means to replace a broken iPod 2nd Gen which finally broke after 6-7 years of usage. I needed a replacement for my iPod since I don't think its wise to risk my iPhone 6 breaking every time I exercise in a gym or go jogging. I think its ludicrous to drop $300 before tax on a brand new 64GB iPod Touch for the reasons I'd be using it for. After researching on the internet, I found several users who used this phone (unactivated) as a media only device. I paid a total of $33 for the phone including tax (rounded), and its probably the best investment I've made. Since I don't have it activated I'm unable to call or text, but that's not what I bought it for in the first place so its fine. I initially purchased this device solely for the ability to listen to music on an affordable device. However, the extra features that I received vastly over exceeded my expectations for such a device. <Phone Aspect> The phone is a decent-small size and feels sturdy in the hand. The screen though is pretty lackluster with low pixel density, subpar screen resolution and not great lighting, but for the price you pay there's no complaints. The positioning on the home screen button underneath the volume control buttons is a little bothersome since anyone with medium to larger hands have difficulty pressing it with their thumb. The removable back plate and option to replace battery are wonderful additions to this phone. There's no front camera, so those who take selfies and use skype are a little out of luck. The back camera is pretty good for a phone of this price though. Most of the people that have used smart phones are probably use to Android or iOS, but this phone runs on Windows. The live tiles and overall user interface are different to what most of us are comfortable with, but it didn't take long to adapt to. It's fairly simple to use and navigate and there aren't any bugs or problems that I am aware of. The option of upgrading memory is one I wish all smart phones have, this however does and its fantastic! The phone comes with 8GB of stock memory which around 2.5 are used up by the phone itself for the system, leaving very little memory. However the option to include a microSD allows it to expand anywhere up to 128GB more memory (for anyone who can afford a 128GB microSD). <Features and Apps> The phone once updated to Windows 8.1 includes Cortana (Windows Personal Assistant). Which is a delight to use, its fairly accurate in understanding my voice requests. Also, with the 8.1 update there includes a notification pull-down such as in Android from the top screen. This notification pull-down also allows screen rotation, airplane mode, wifi settings, and bluetooth as well. Unlike my previous iPod it allows me to use Pandora, Netflix and social media apps that weren't supported under my old iPod due to Apple not supporting updates to older models. Nokia's maps called Here Maps are probably my favorite feature. They work offline once you download the map for your country,state or province. The app store is not something that one would be excited for as it lacks a lot of variety compared to Apple or Google. It does contain basically all major apps that one would want with a few exceptions. For $33, plus the option of a microSD card if you need more memory (I paid $25 for 64GB). You get a basic smart phone that can make calls and texts; plays videos, music and games; and includes all other basic smart phone functions (camera, calculator, etc). It has a personal assistant in Cortana, along with a built in GPS system that works offline with no connectivity required. No other device offers all this for the same price range, which makes this a great purchase.",9.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 520 (AT&T Go Phone) No Annual Contract (Discontinued by Manufacturer),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-520-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00E45043A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X1D2B1IKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00E45043A,4,59.99,0.0
2495,B00E45043A,HBE,4,3-Dec-14,True,I like this better than the Android platform as far as ...,"I like this better than the Android platform as far as general usability. The new voice assistant seems to work well, it does everything I did with Siri on my iPhone, but the Windows app need smoothing out still and most of your favorite apps may not yet be on the platform. The phone seems well built, solid buttons, and I prefer this smaller and thinner size in a phone. For 30 dollars though you can't beat this little thing. I'm not using the cell function right now, but as a piece of technology it's a great deal and I suspect it would make a good phone. I like the touchpad as much or more than my iPhone 4s and far more than my old Android. My problem with Android phones is the lack of consistent interface and workflow coupled with bloatware from phone makers, otherwise Android seems to have the devs and app support that I would want. The speaker is LOUD, so this thing makes a great MP3 player or even cheap portable mini room system. It's way loud enough to hear in a room and even loud enough in the shower. Not sure how fast the wifi is, but everything seems fairly snappy overall with the phone. I think I like MS's email app better than anything in iphone or android, their office apps are cool looking, not sure I need them, but pretty nice. The tiles work great for mobile platforms, not sure why they smeared the metro interface so badly by forcing it on desktop users. For no reason I can explain the virtual keyboard works better for me than the iphone and I make less typos, though auto suggest still needs improvement as it does on all platforms. The single biggest flaw for me is the App view being a single row, that's a pretty big flaw, but yeah for 30 dollars I can deal with it. I wanted to try a Windows 8 phone so this gave me the opportunity to own one on the cheap. Even as an mp3 player alone this thing blow away everything else on the market at 30 dollars, plus it's a full fledged smart phone AND has GPS and offline maps. It also has a built in FM tuner. I have certainly not tested all the features or longevity. As a little compact computer this thing rocks. I can't really comment on it as a phone, but if MS keeps improving this platform and gets apps I'll probably make my next actual smart PHONE an MS based one.",7.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 520 (AT&T Go Phone) No Annual Contract (Discontinued by Manufacturer),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-520-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00E45043A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X1D2B1IKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00E45043A,4,59.99,0.0

1605,B00A2V7BA4,dudeonmoon,3,3-Dec-12,False,Still falls short of expectations,"Thought I'd give the Lumia 920 an earnest try when it came out... waited for months after the initial preview of the 920 without any specs, and also resisted the urge to buy the iphone 5 (was using 3gs at the time, and it was getting slow). Well guess what, bought the lumia 920, felt good for a day or two, but then started seeing some glaring omissions from windows phone 8 OS. And no, I am not talking about Apps not being available on the marketplace and all that.... simple things are missing in WP8, or they are there but there is no easy way to know about them. For example, on iOS, it is very easy to tap on a block of text and choose ""Select All"" to select all text and just plain delete it. Helps on address bars on webpages, emails that you want to delete stuff from and a lot more things. I could not for the life of me find a way to do that on WP8. The only option is to select a word, then drag the selectors to the beginning and the end, and basically forget what you were trying to do in the first place. Another example is Nokia Drive. While touted as excellent with offline capabilities and accurate GPS, I could not find a way to simply choose a different route. On iOS and Android, the maps present several alternate routes that one can choose from, so if I need to drive along a specific route I can do that. The navigation voice-over is also sub-par because it does not call out the names of roads all the time. Half the time, it would tell me to take a turn on [insert name of road] road, while the other half - it would just ask me to take a right. That is not acceptable today. Both iOS (even though map search sucks, the navigation UI and guidance itself is excellent) and google offer literally hands-free and eyes-free navigation, where I could keep my phone in the cup-holder or on bluetooth and it would literally tell me which road to take and what turns to make. I could not do that on the Nokia 920. Lastly, what is the deal with Microsoft's insistence of combining everything into my hotmail or windows live account, which I never used before, and dont ever plan on using? Sure, Apple has their iCloud account which you have to use, but your phone contacts stay as your phone contacts. The moment I setup my Lumia 920, all my contacts became hotmail or live contacts, and it merged my facebook contacts with rest of them. I know there is a way to filter how contacts are shown, it still very very annoying to have 2-4 entries of the same people (their different accounts) and then having to sift through all that. WP8 is great, but it has some omissions that only show up when you start using the OS. Microsoft cannot expect us to use it just because it has live tiles - it should have all the necessary features that are present in all the modern mobile OSs.

1476,B00A2V7BA4,Gadget Lover,4,3-Dec-12,False,"Amazing, intuitive phone - but some big kinks to iron out","This is a very impressive phone - I got it to replace my old BlackBerry and it is clearly a huge upgrade. The interface is easy to understand, very responsive and colorful. It easily manages my 500+ contacts, the Audible app works great, Nokia Music, Maps and smart photo apps are also excellent. I would really like to give this phone full marks. We have a couple of iPads at home, and I have to say I much prefer the Windows Phone interface. There are, however, a few kinks - some of which are major. The battery lasts through most days, but not always - with the extra free wireless charger from AT&T that is something easy to live with. The Smart Photo app sometimes hangs (although, impressively, the phone has never stalled like my BlackBerry used to - the home button always works). These I could live with. The major showstopper for me (and it is a big one) is that my work email and calendar are based on gmail and there is at least one major problem with how Windows Phone and Gmail interact. The problem is that when replying to emails with long subject lines, Windows Phone often messes up the header - basically rendering the email almost unreadable for the recipient. I want to think this is a small and easy to fix problem, but I was surprised to see it discussed on the Internet as far back as May and with Windows Phone 7. (The problem, in case any Microsoft employees read this, is that Windows Phone is adding extra line breaks in the long subject line - breaking the header and making the encoding and multipart boundaries part of the message body; which ends up rendering as plain text when HTML or some more expressive encoding needed). So I am not very confident a fix is coming. So I am currently torn on whether to keep my phone (and manually edit long subject lines when replying to email) or trade it in for Droid or iPhone (the Galaxy S3 is not advertised as a world phone in the US and probably wouldn't work for me).",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1716,B00A2V7BA4,Poppin,4,3-Dec-12,False,Perfect for Secret Agents,"The reviews here are pretty much the same but there are good aspects to this phone that make it perfect for spys like me. I've owned it since Nov. 12th, 2012. 1. Downloadable maps and navigation. Handy for a chase scene, it works exactly like a commercial GPS navigation unit with time to destination, audible turn by turn, etc... Even has audio alerts for exceeding speed limits and can be on in the background (battery willing). You can adjust the variance up to 18mph if limit is under 50mph and limit is over 50mph. Perfect for not attracting local law enforcement when you are cruising w/ some of the worlds most wanted. 2. Downloadable languages for navigation, Pretty much all popular languages around the world! Note, if you pick a language like Chinese they will only speak directions using the metric system. 3. Bing translation doesn't have that many languages but pointing your camera at a menu or any place that has text you want to translate will overlay the translation over the text on the screen. Again, language packs are downloadable (Chinese is 33MB) so if you are in a foreign country you don't have to use wireless data. Search for videos on windows phone 8 bing translator and prepare to say the ""C"" word that rhymes with pool. 4. Easily accessible micro-sim door. Perfect for swapping SIM cards when you are evading local authorities, or at least slowing them down. 5. Battery life is very good. Yes, your battery life will feel like crap when you first get it because you are trying all kinds of apps and features which drain your battery but after you settle down and get down to daily use the battery is adequate and usual for any smartphone. Again, depends on what you are running in the background but you can set those also. 6. Display is better than an iPhone. Really! Pictures of secret documents have good detail and are readable in direct sunlight. 7. Yes, I've had to reset my phone once a week so far but all phones do that with heavy use. RIght now that's my only gripe. It won't turn on when pressing the on button and pressing the volume down and on button at the same time will reboot the phone. It takes about 1min. for it to boot to the start screen and about 15sec. to get a signal from ATT. You'd usually need a reliable phone for IEDs but it's too good looking for that. I think it'll survive the blast also. Construction is good so they can trace the phone. There is a youtube video of it being shot by an AK-47 and blown up. 8. Plug it in via USB and transfer music, movies, video, pictures like a flash drive (no drivers needed). Perfect for the occasional corporate espionage. Plus, you know how many times people ask me how to copy their pictures and video from their iPhone or iPad? I knew a spy that did't know how to copy thousands of pictures they took on a recent sting operation in Tunisia and were clueless on how to copy all of them at once for a debriefing. It's ridiculous. 9. For some reason when I plug in my headphones the volume goes all the way down and stays down till I unplug it. I found that I was plugging it too fast. When I plug it in slow it's fine. Audio quality is okay. And no, I don't play borne ulitmatum and 007 theme music when I'm on mission. 10. The phone is heavy but a buff secret agent like me can handle it. Still lighter than other surveillance equipment we have. 11. Camera is great for scouting sites and valuable assets. Good low light performance gives good detail without the assets knowing we are recording them. It's not great but it is as good as a point and shoot camera w/ a Back-lighted CMOS sensor. Can select multiple images when sending e-mails. Can automatically upload high quality images and video to skydrive when connected to WiFi. 12. AT&T LTE internet is hella fast. 13. The usual Windows Phone integration features are beautiful. 14. I'm using a business plan which has unlimited LTE data plan and 1,500 messages for $35. 15. Bought a cheap case after dropping it getting out of the shower from ear level to a tiled floor. Small bump on corner but phone was working like it did from day one. Works just as good. Gorilla glass is great, dropped it from stomach level and it landed on concrete on it's face without a scratch. No need for screen protector, just a cheap case. 16. Kids zone is perfect for letting my ""love interest"" play games and use apps without getting to my secret stuff but beware, multi-tasking doesn't work in kids zone. If they play a game and get out of it, it'll have to load the game again and the'll lose their place if the game doesn't have auto-save. 17. Mines came with the Nokia wireless charger but I thought it would be a Micro-USB connector but it's a DC connector that you plug into a wall charger. I thought I could put the wireless charger in my super duper spy car but unless it's a Toyota Matrix w/ an integrated AC plug or you have a cigarette plug inverter I can't. With an inverter it gets bulky unless you hide it under a seat. 18. Wordament game helps me brush up on my engrish. Game is only available for Windows Phone and Windows 8. It's addicting.

13958,B071ZDQ6MV,Joseph C. Henricks,5,3-Aug-17,True,A feature by feature break down.,"I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far. Short Version Pro's - Price is seems very low for what you get. - Battery life is shockingly good. (ha) - Phone feels amazing in the hand, the one piece of aluminum shell can't be beat - Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break. - Speaker sounds great and achieves good volume. - Bare bones android, the dream. - Comprehensive antenna set for travel. Con's - No usb C connector, uses the more common micro usb. - Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots. - Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable. - Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection. - It doesn't make me breakfast. Feel and buttons: The phone feels extremely high quality, it's the only phone that I really hate having a case on because the aluminum feels so nice. The power and volume buttons are also aluminum and very solid, there have been complaints about them being hard to press, they aren't, they are just stiff enough that you won't easily accidentally press them like all other phones. Touch screen and fingerprint sensor: The screen felt a little off to me and it doesn't register touch perfectly but it's on par with other flag ship phones I've owned and I am still just getting use to it. The finger print sensor on this phone is amazing, it is covered with durable glass and reads finger prints very well. If you have issues with it re-enter your print, when I did it worked great. Battery: Holy crap, I've never, ever, had a phone that lasts like this one with the stock battery, my previous phone had an extended battery that more then doubled it's capacity and this phone doesn't drain much faster then it did. Charges reasonably quick and doesn't turn into a fire brick while charging and doing tasks. Camera: Ok, so my last phone had an amazing manual mode with full shudder speed controls and the works. This one comes with a stock android camera app that is pretty weak for features and merely ok at capturing good shots. Apps like open camera help resolve this but it's a little bit buggy on this phone, especially when trying to control shudder speed. I can't speak a lot to the selfie camera because I don't really use them. Speaker: How does something this cheap have speakers this good? I don't have an answer, I'm just really happy it does. It's not super loud, it reaches about average volume, but does it with rich sound for a phone. Software: Stock android, no bloat other then the amazon apps but who isn't using prime? The ads are very easy to ignore and I'll gladly ignore an ad for 50 dollars, I honestly don't even notice them. Antenna's/Travel: One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because I am spending some time in Europe and it has, by far, the most comprehensive LTE antenna setup for the cost. I searched forever trying to find a phone with the 3,7,20 bands for Europe, I was struggling to find flag ship phones that had it and here it is on a entry level. Durability: The Youtuber JerryRigEverything said this may be his pick for most durable phone of 2017. I could have guessed that when it arrived. If you look closely at the phone you can see the spacer built between the screen and the outer edge of the phone, creating a bumper to help protect it. A thin rubber case is enough to make this phone very unlikely to be damaged. Even if you fall victim to the the very satisfying feel of this phone without a case you'd have to give it a pretty harsh drop to crack it. If I think of anything else I'll edit the review later, if you have questions comment on this review and I'll try to address them. Finding the right phone to fit your situation can be tough but I believe this particular phone can fit nicely into most peoples situations.",690.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

Took me a while to change the settings on the pone back to English. Was able to get it done and started to use the phone and was a little satisfied with the use until i tried asking my friend to call on the phone to check if its unlocked. It was unlocked but the ringer volume was very feeble and no one had mentioned about it in the reviews. I could barely hear it when it was like 2 feet away from me and i also tried adding different ringtones but it was of no use. I feel the ringer volume is an important feature in a phone as i would miss many calls even if the phone is next to me so i would give this phone 2 stars.

2315,B00CQAODG4,Craig A. Jordan,5,3-Aug-13,True,Bluetooth and Toyota Prius,The Bluetooth 3.0 on this phone is the best I have used yet. I can stream from the Nokia Music App or the other popular streaming services and it shows the song info perfectly in my 2012 Toyota Prius. It also does the Address book sync and the incoming text message to voice with spoken reply without a hitch. There are plenty of Apps in the store for my needs. I love that I can play XBOX Arcade games that earn Gamer Points. I'm impressed on how I can adjust the size and placement of the tiles. The battery life is great. I can talk on the phone during my 45 min commute one or both ways or stream music via Bluetooth both ways and I'll still have 3/4 battery left at the end of the day. So far I can't find fault with anything with the phone. I love it!

1530,B00A2V7BA4,RP600,2,3-Aug-13,False,"A couple of high points, but generally a frustrating experience.","I desperately wanted to like this phone. I'd eagerly watched most the conference videos leading up to its launch, and was excited about replacing my aging iPhone with something bigger, faster, slicker, and less tightly controlled. I called the store almost daily and eventually was able to pick it up locally a couple of days before the official launch date and immediately put it to work. For the first couple of weeks, I was very impressed with the speed, UI simplicity, and performance. After living with it for many months now, I regret buying this phone almost daily. The screen is big, sharp, and crisp. The touch sensitivity is excellent. The UI is incredibly fast for the most part. The excessive weight that seemed to be a negative point in so many reviews rarely bothered me. Carrying it is fine, but I found myself dropping it easily if using the phone while kicked back in a chair or laying in bed. The wireless charging feature is well worth it. The ease of getting media on and off the phone vs. say the torturous experience of using iTunes is very welcome. The exterior hardware quality was slightly disappointing. The top edge of my first (black) handset didn't seem to fit quite right against the top edge of the screen. Pressing on it, or plugging in headphones resulted in an audible 'click' from the casing as if a tab was snapping into place, then it would pop back out again. The other two black handsets in the store also did this, and I was told on the windows phone forums that this was common for the black and white handset cases. The earpiece speaker became very crackly after a couple of months, and I sent the phone back for a replacement, this time getting the red version as the casing seemed sturdier. The clicking issue was no longer present, and the joint between screen and casing seemed to be more accurate on the red model I received back. Sadly, I felt that the experience all fell apart when I actually tried to perform tasks on the phone. The driving navigation and map apps are awful, occasionally routing me to the wrong destination even if it has the address and zip code correct. Searching for an address using the bing app, then getting to the Drive navigation app felt clunky, as you have to go via the native maps app. After being sent to the wrong destinations several times, I don't feel comfortable relying on it as a navigation device now, and use it only as a last resort. When using it as a GPS, on several occasions the battery has run out faster than it can be recharged in the car - less than ideal for long trips. I've needed to open PDF documents several times while I've been out and had no access to a tablet or computer, and the app has completely destroyed the formatting, making the documents impossible to read, navigate, and ultimately led to failure extracting the information I was trying to read. Very irritating when you're trying to pull up a restaurant menu or a product datasheet to compare specifications while you're standing in a store. App support is sadly poor. While they boast having many of the top 50 all-platform apps, the experience between the iOS/Android and Windows phone versions rarely seems to be given equal care and attention. A couple of examples that spring to mind - the IMDB app lacks the autocomplete feature of the iOS version. The kindle app randomly eliminates lines from a book at the point it's broken up into pages, the text messaging app seems to open multiple instances of itself for the same conversation, and frequently hangs, forcing you to reboot the phone. I have been through several iterations of the Facebook app, plus several third party versions and all are lacking. Whether it's laggy menus, missing features, or just poor stability resulting in the apps closing unexpectedly, it's a frustrating experience way too much of the time. Other top apps which offer stellar experiences on other platforms just seem to lack the polish in the windows phone version. When on a phone call, you can go to look up information on the phone, with a 'tap here to return to the call' bar at the top. I find that frequently the phone will auto-return to the call screen without touching this notification, meaning I have about ten seconds to find what I was looking for before it closes out what I was doing and dumps me back at the call screen. The much-hyped camera has been one of the biggest letdowns. The quality just does not seem to be there, and the automatic flash is dim-witted. I regularly find that the last 'preview' of a photo looks perfect, then when it actually takes the photo the lighting is completely wrong, resulting in blown out or too dark photos. I use it for documenting repair procedures and need to be able to take a series of photos in order, with minimum fuss. I find myself having to retake many of these which slows everything down. The back and search buttons on the front of the device are easy to accidentally hit when using it one-handed. Because it's heavy and fairly slippery, the ball of your thumb, or a stray finger can often brush against one of these buttons, either closing our your app or loading the fairly terrible bing function. Incidentally, you can't program the bing hotkey to do anything else, nor can you disable it. In short, I find this phone to have fairly nice hardware, but the frustration of trying to get work done on it is just too great for me. I will be replacing it with one of the mainstream offerings as soon as I am eligible. I would strongly advise anyone considering it to try and use one in real-world scenarios for at least two weeks before committing. By my third week I was starting to notice the numerous cracks in its armor, and by that time I was too late to exchange it.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

22359,B07N11SM58,Jim Carter,5,3-Apr-19,True,A Great Alternative To The $1000+ Phones,"In order for this statement to be useful, you should know something about me, my use of a smartphone and the products that preceded this Nokia. I operate a sole proprietorship--computer sales, consulting, training and service. Additionally; I depend on a phone for an equally busy social life. Until this purchase, I was solely a user of Samsung phones, my most recent being the Galaxy S7 Edge. That device had nearly a dozen issues (including sluggish behavior), despite the fact I had wiped and reloaded on a few occasions. Aspects of Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Your Phone Companion NEVER worked correctly. A friend had me assist with her Galaxy S9 and I was astounded at the increase in bloatware since the S7. With the aforementioned Samsung phones, they had both carrier (AT&T) and manufacturer bloatware. The PureView is bloatware free! It bests the S7 in other ways: a faster processor, more RAM, newer Bluetooth technology, Android 9 vs 8, more storage. The performance is as smooth as melted butter. I've spent 4 straight days loading and testing apps and I couldn't be more pleased. The geeks who write reviews professionally like to whine that the Nokia has ""last year's processor"". Who cares? Sometimes they even complain about the lack of a headphone jack and no ability to add a SD card. The onboard storage is 128GB (I store everything in the cloud anyway) and there's an included USB C adapter to accommodate headphones. You can nitpick about any product, regardless of cost. If the device serves my needs, that's all that matters. I'm not competing with other users to see who has the most powerful processor, etc. From a dollars and cents standpoint, why should I pay $300 to $500 more for the latest Samsung when this Nokia does everything I need professionally and personally? The only downside to this purchase--few quality accessories, but that's not Nokia's fault. As the phone ages, maybe the number and quality of these products will improve. I'll add that I purchased 2 clear cases (not Nokia brand) and both give the appearance there's a bubble or area of water between the case and the back of the phone. I finally settled on a solid black case. Don't dare use this phone without a case. It's super slippery!! UPDATE: I've now had the opportunity to try 2 wired (included + Sennheiser) and 2 Bluetooth headphones (Logitech H800 + BTS Sport from 66 Audio). Only the BTS Sport Bluetooth headphones provided adequate volume for music. They're an excellent choice to pair with this phone! The included, wired, ear canal phones were better than I expected and may be fine for most.

20491,B07HD3QC65,Pilot S.,1,29-Oct-18,True,*UPDATE*BEWARE* USB port charging issue.,Bought this phone 5 months ago when it first came out. It was great until a few days ago. USB port works intermittently. I have to wiggle the the cable just to get it to charge and also since USB port issue the charging seems to gotten slower. I have sent the phone back to Nokia hopefully they can fix the issue if not Im never gonna buy a Nokia phone also request my money back if I can. *UPDATE* sent the phone out to nokia and they it was water damage in the USB port. Thats B.S. !!! I never took my phone near water and they said they can't repair because it cost as much as the phone So I'm out of a $349.00 phone NEVER again buy Nokia. I really like the phone too. Awesome resolution and camera but nokia fell realy short. I wish I can give it negative 5 stars!!! **UPDATE** bought a new USB charging port online for less than $3.00 each so I bought 2 just in case hopefully it works. might as well get it fix on my own instead of buying a new phone. Luckily have a spare 2014 Samsung galaxy S5 to use that's still going strong to this day!!! I might make the Nokia phone a spare if I get it fixed HAHAHA F.U. NOKIA! !!! ***UPDATE*** Replaced the charging port myself that I bought online that cost less than USD 3.00. Saw a YouTube tutorial on how to replace the port. Took me less than 30 mins to replace super easy. Bought a magnetic USB C charger cable so that the charging port doesn't get worn out and loose which is the common issue on all Nokia phones. FYI even with the magnetic attachment for the phone the attachment is still loose so what I did was wrap the the attachment in duct tape so it fits snug into the USB port. I have no issues from doing my own repairs and modifications. I still love the phone even with my with 1 star review.,52.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

1810,B00A7F57EM,James,5,29-Nov-12,False,Lumia 822 In Depth,"The Nokia Lumia 822 from Verizon is an excellent choice for Verizon customers looking to move to a Windows Phone. ASTHETICS I'll start off with the asthetics of this phone. This phone is much more attractive then the photos make it appear to be. PLASTIC - The plastic is sturdy and thick with a high quality fit and finish to it. The black and grey is a flat finish while the white is glossy. It is a plastic with no grip coating and a nice textured look. It does not have the rubbery looking finish as seen on the 8X. For the White glossy finish it however takes a hit in the quality department. The glossy finish gives off a cheap look and feel. It's sad because I was really gunning to get it in white until I saw it. The back cover uses a snap on clip system that hold firmly and does not flex without moderate force. The back cover features NFC but the WIRELESS CHARGING IS NOT INCLUDED. A new cover is required. FEEL - The sides of the phone have and inward slant from bottom to top which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maintain a firm grip.The phone uses a wider display then you see on other phones. I have big hands and it fits well into them. It feels nice weight wise. It has a little heft to it when holding it but not heavy enough to be bothersome. It feels durable but it a little thick. If you like the iPhone 5 for it's size then this will surely let you down. BUTTONS - The buttons are located on the right side and are thin. They have a firm placement and a nice click to them. The click isn't loud but it makes for an excellent feel. The power button is placed perfectly for your right thumb, I however am left handed and I find it a little more difficult to press.The Photo button is a 2 stage button. It takes a little getting used to as the second stage feels muddy and firmer then the size of the button leads on to be. GLASS - The glass uses an edge to edge front with the exception of the plastic on the bottom portion of the phone. The bezel around the glass is very slight with no gaps. It sports a nice solid black surrounding the display with very responsive touch buttons below. HARDWARE DISPLAY - The display is a 480x800 AMOLED Gorilla glass 2 display. Don't let the resolution fool you though. The screen is bright and the colors pop nicely. I found it to look much better than the 8X display. When the display is turned off or is showing black it blends in with the bezel and looks great. The display sesitivity is great and features an ultra sensitive capacitive touchscreen that works with gloves on although your experience will depend on the gloves. Thicker leather gloves do not work. The touch buttons are just as responsive. PHONE- Phone calls are crystal clear and other callers hear me perfectly. Easily the highest performing phone I've ever owned smartphone wise. The speakerphone is loud and clear as well. The reception on this phone is great as well recieving a reliable signal in even the most problematic areas. CAMERA - This camera is amazing, for the most part. Low light shots come out great with the extreme flash good enough to take a good photo in a blacked out room. it does however suffer from oversaturation and sometimes the white balance just does not work out so well. I think it's more of a software issue and I expect the problems to be resolved in future updates. Nokia exclusive software includes Creative studio for photo editing and Cinemagraph to make animated photos. I took a picure with my daughter moving round in front of a mirror and edited it so she was standing still and just the reflection was moving. Everyone loves it. It outpaces my iphone in every way imaginable. The front camera stays on average grounds however. AUDIO - It features a mono speaker located on the bottom left of the phone. It's really loud but it suffers from a tinny sound. I could hear this thing from across the house though. The earpiece however sounde great and has excellent balance to it. I can hear people even in a noisy room. the headphone jack is on the top right of the phone and features features audio processing from Dolby to include an EQ and ""Dolby Headphone"". Dolby headphone would be best described as the equivelant of the Beats Audio software. It boosts some frequencies and thats about it. It helped out my high ohm headphones out a little bit but is not a replacement for a hardware amplifier. BATTERY - The battery is average and nothing to write home about. I use my phone moderately and it gives me about 16-17 hours on a charge. It stays at the 100% mark for about 2 hours and slowly rolls down hill after that. It is nice having the removable battery though. This includes talking, web surfing, apps, games, photos, texting, ect. MEMORY - 16GB on board memory provides about 12GB of free space after a hard reset is performed (deletes all of the downloaded maps from Nokia Drive). You can then download only the areas you need from Nokia Drive. It also sports an internal SD slot and the battery has to be removed to insert/remove the card. Apps cannot be stored on it. CPU/RAM - This phone has all of the same core hardware specification as every other windows Phone currently available in the U.S. The lower resolution display frees up some memory though and enables the OS to be zippier. SOFTWARE APPLICATION EXCLUSIVES - One thing you get with Nokia is exclusive software. Nokia Drive is not on other handsets yet. It also includes a few extra ""lenses"" (photo apps) such as the aformentioned cinemagraph, Panorama, and smart shoot which takes a series of pictures and then lets you replace peoples faces until you get a shot where everyone is simling. These apps all work great and are fun to play around with. It also includes Creative Studio which is like a photoshop/Instagram filter app. It works well and holds alot of features. Other apps include ESPN, Univision, Words With Friends, Foursquare, Groupon, Nokia City Lens and more. There are currently 32 apps exclusive to Nokia phones on the store as of this writing. OS - Windows phone 8 is a whole new review, I came from the iPhone and I love it. There are enough note worthy apps available to keep me comfortable and the operating system holds enough features to be more then usable on a daily basis. It has it's fall backs but there is nothing to make me run for the hills. I can say that it runs like a champ on this phone. No stuttering, slow loading times, or crashes have happened on this phone. It outpaces my iPhones performance enough to make me go wow. The Verizon exclusive (for now) Data Sense software works great and tracks your data usage and breaks it down to Cellular/Wifi and each app usage and resets whenever you want it to. APP STORE - It's got alot of junk, but if you sift through it there is alot of cool stuff on there. Some things are slim pickings while others have a copy of a copy of a copy. It's no better then android or Apple. There are alot of big name developers announcing new titles every day. OVERALL Overall the phone is fairly attractive, solid, well designed, high quality and very usable. The only design problems I have is the power button being odd for a left hander and the 2nd stage of the camera button just not feeling quite right. The OS is fast, responsive and zippy. The phone works like a champ, The camera is a little quirky but it still is a great camera considering what you have to compete against. It's big and heafty but not quite a brick and I love that. The display is amazzzzzing even though he resolution is a little below current industry standards. Battery is good enough but could be better, I feel like I will get caught with my pants down one of these days. For 100$ you cant go wrong with this phone. It is way better quality then anything else you can find for this price and sets a standard by which every phone in its price range will need to improve to outpace it. If your looking into a windows phone This will surely not disapoint unless you really cant settle for the lower resolution display.",33.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 822 16GB Windows Phone Black - Verizon,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Windows-Phone-Black/dp/B00A7F57EM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxGoYUWTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A7F57EM,62,204.16,0.0

1655,B00A2V7BA4,home,5,29-Nov-12,False,Great phone,"Decided to copy my review from the red phone as I I ended up getting a great deal on this and bought three of them in white, blue and red (for my wife, daughter, myself). The wireless charging is amazing and works just like my electric toothbrush, just sit it on a pad (of course mine is the only one still backordered). The blue phone arrived last, red was second to arrive while white came in pretty quick but that's what my wife wanted after seeing the iPhone in white. I don't know why these are unavailable on Amazon although I have heard many stores are also sold out in one color or another. As for AT&T, I was willing to leave and go try Verizon but couldn't pass up on the deal due to my company's discounts on service PLUS I wanted this phone. My nephew also recently gave up his Iphone after many years to go buy a Lumia 920. He was able to move his music collection (from ITunes) with the app for his Mac. He considered Galaxy or Nexus as well and absolutely loves this phone. How heavy? At first I thought it was heavy when I was trying it out in the store but now I am used to it. No one in the family complaining but know that it's heavier than most smartphones. If you have trouble carrying another 30 grams or so, perhaps look into doing some pushups :). How sturdy? I also bought a case for my wife but she doesn't use it, the phone seems sturdy enough. What about the OS? As for the Windows Phone OS, I haven't noticed any showstoppers. The interface is refreshing, fast and fluid. You have to keep the phone to realize how much easier it is to integrate with Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. I haven't explored a new feature called rooms or groups but it seems interesting for a family to stay in sync with shared contacts, calendar, notes etc. almost like an electronic bulletin board. My wife is not technical so will have to see how useful this feature is or if she uses it. Will update the review on this one. As for apps, they keep coming every day and I don't feel like it's limited or what the brouhaha is. The only one I hear about is instagram but I hear its coming. Critical feature that sold me on this versus alternatives? Nokia Maps. I also considered HTC 8x but felt Nokia had more apps I wanted and I expect better support. One of the best phones I have ever owned was a Nokia and this seems solid. I would consider the 8x if the weight really bothers you but again, we are all used to it already. Quick review of AT&T stores if I may: AT&T help and knowledge of these products at the store is a hit or miss. When asked what is the difference between 920 and 820, I got, one's bigger than the other. Daaah!!! How about wireless charging built in, the awesome camera (btw pics and video on this are great and much better than my old phone and rival my canon Point and shoot), xbox integration (some of it is gimmicky but man I use it as a remote more than I thought), Nokia music. What I would have liked to see more of: FM radio but I can live without it. Nothing else comes to mind for now. If you go with an open mind with no preconceived notions (hard to do if you are a fanboy or fangirl), you'll be pleasantly surprised. To add, 12/1/2012: I wondered if the phone locks do you just wait it for it to die or is there a reset? I found out at the AT&T store (sorry if I said bad things about you before) you can press volume and power and hold for 5-10 seconds and the device resets (like ctl alt del). I now need to find a clip so I can attach it to my dash somehow for music and gps.

My nephew also recently gave up his Iphone after many years to go buy a Lumia 920. He was able to move his music collection (from ITunes) with the app for his Mac. He considered Galaxy or Nexus as well and absolutely loves this phone. How heavy? At first I thought it was heavy when I was trying it out in the store but now I am used to it. No one in the family complaining but know that it's heavier than most smartphones. If you have trouble carrying another 30 grams or so, perhaps look into doing some pushups :). How sturdy? I also bought a case for my wife but she doesn't use it, the phone seems sturdy enough. What about the OS? As for the Windows Phone OS, I haven't noticed any showstoppers. The interface is refreshing, fast and fluid. You have to keep the phone to realize how much easier it is to integrate with Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. I haven't explored a new feature called rooms or groups but it seems interesting for a family to stay in sync with shared contacts, calendar, notes etc. almost like an electronic bulletin board. My wife is not technical so will have to see how useful this feature is or if she uses it. Will update the review on this one. As for apps, they keep coming every day and I don't feel like it's limited or what the brouhaha is. The only one I hear about is instagram but I hear its coming. Critical feature that sold me on this versus alternatives? Nokia Maps. I also considered HTC 8x but felt Nokia had more apps I wanted and I expect better support. One of the best phones I have ever owned was a Nokia and this seems solid. I would consider the 8x if the weight really bothers you but again, we are all used to it already. Quick review of AT&T stores if I may: AT&T help and knowledge of these products at the store is a hit or miss. When asked what is the difference between 920 and 820, I got, one's bigger than the other. Daaah!!! How about wireless charging built in, the awesome camera (btw pics and video on this are great and much better than my old phone and rival my canon Point and shoot), xbox integration (some of it is gimmicky but man I use it as a remote more than I thought), Nokia music. What I would have liked to see more of: FM radio but I can live without it. Nothing else comes to mind for now. If you go with an open mind with no preconceived notions (hard to do if you are a fanboy or fangirl), you'll be pleasantly surprised. To add, 12/1/2012: I wondered if the phone locks do you just wait it for it to die or is there a reset? I found out at the AT&T store (sorry if I said bad things about you before) you can press volume and power and hold for 5-10 seconds and the device resets (like ctl alt del). I now need to find a clip so I can attach it to my dash somehow for music and gps.

4151,B00KM10ITK,BJR,4,29-Jun-15,True,Good but not great.,"I don't know whether this phone is truly unlocked because I didn't have another provider's sim to try. I'm on an ATT network anyway so my sim was good to go. I like the Windows platform... better than Android, it seems more stable and more organized. This is an entry level phone but it does all I need a device to do at this point in my life. I gave up a lot of flashy hardware extras, and some software extras by making this move backwards. My only regret is the lack of apps that allow more control over personalizing the phone's use. This model doesn't support an automatic power on/off ... or a gravity or proximity sensor sleep/wake for the screen. It doesn't support the double tap screen ""wake up"" either. I will be using the power button a lot more than I had to with the newer Androids, and I wish Windows or Nokia would update the hardware controls to offer those features. Otherwise, the 635 is sturdy, lightweight, the right size, and I don't miss not having an led flash because the camera takes decent pix without one. I find Cortana a little dense at times, but we're getting along okay. I wish Nokia would put a voice microphone on the keyboard, independent of Cortana, for those of us who like to dictate text rather than type. Bottom line, it's a real nice phone, but not a great one.

The hardware itself is rock solid all around and depending on your design sensibilities, beautiful as well. Nobody could hold this phone in their hand and guess it costs less than $250. Feels and looks premium. Of course there had to be sacrifices at this price and the most noticable is speed. I'm coming off a Nexus 5X and it is slower than the Nexus but it isn't frustratingly slow to me. The camera also isn't quite up to the level of top performers but I mostly see the difference in low light situations.

2329,B00CQAODG4,Aaron L. Smith,5,29-Jul-13,True,I love this phone!,"I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon, and this is the first review I have been compelled to write here. This phone is that good. I am coming from a Droid X2, which I wasn't really unhappy with except for the battery life. I won't get into the battery life issue as I am not reviewing the Droid, but let's just say it was atrocious. I was not unhappy with Android OS, but I didn't love it either, so when my contract was up I was willing to take a look around to see what else was out there for me. All of the phones I was considering (Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note II, Iphone 5, Droid Maxx) were $200 or more, so I was surprised to find this Nokia for $29.99 here at amazon (It can be had for $19.99 right now at wirefly.com, but I am a Prime member so the basically overnight shipping and support was worth the extra $10). I read about the issues with app availability and synching to Google, then I went down to the local Verizon store and played with the phone. I loved the interface and the look of the live tiles, but it still took me a couple of days to decide I was comfortable moving away from Android. I am so glad I did. Pros: -price. There just is not another deal like this out there. -Windows8 Phone OS. It is so simple, visually attractive, fast, and stable. My apps launch now, switching between apps or from apps to the home screen, the phone never hangs. It just runs silky smooth everywhere, and everything is easy to find and work with. Apps just work in WP8, and they work the same way every time. I had a lot of on again/off again functionality with the Droid apps, they would work like they were supposed to most of the time, but sometimes they wouldn't. The Droid OS did the same kind of stuff to me, sometimes it would sign on to the wireless at work or home automatically like it was supposed to, sometimes it wouldn't and I would need to do it manually. I also love being able to uninstall any app, I hated the amount of pre-loaded crap that was on my Droid. There is a ton more to love about WP8, like the way it consolidates all of your contact information from multiple sources into one contact (so facebook profile, LinkedIn profile gmail profile, etc... for the same person are all presented to you as a unified profile with all the data from the separate services, but the profiles all remain distinct in the background and can be edited individually), but I won't get into every bit of it, you should just try it yourself. -email client. This really belongs under the WP8 OS heading, but that was getting long and the email interface is so nice on this phone that it deserves it's own section. It's the little things, but it really is the most pleasant email interface I have used. Gmail works flawlessly here too. -Integration with other Microsoft services. I love how smooth the MS Office apps work here, they are so useable it is just a pleasure to work with Excel, Word, Outlook, PP, etc... -MS SmartGlass integration. I am a gamer and Xbox is my proffered platform for consoles (I have and like a PS3 as well but the 360 is what I use for multiplayer so I use it a lot more). The SmartGlass app works so smoothly and is so cool, it is just a great feature. I know it is available on Android/iOS as well, but it just functions flawlessly here on WP8. Spartan Assault is also very cool, really good Halo game on a phone. -Nokia phone. I have always loved Nokias and this is no exception. Good solid build quality and well thought out overall. -Performance. This phone blazes and switches between tasks so fast. It is only a dual core, 1.5 GHz processor but it really works great. From what I have read (and experienced), WP8 is not the processor hog that Android is. -Battery life. I can go a whole day and part of the next without a recharge unless I am hammering it with games/video and tons of downloading. This was my main complaint about my Droid and I am really pleased with the Nokia battery so far. It also has built in wireless charging. I didn't think I cared about this until I tried it, now I won't be going back to plugging in a phone to charge, ever. -Reception. I get 4G reception with this phone in areas where my wife is only getting 3G, and I get signal in pretty remote areas where others are getting nothing. I hike and ride my mountain bike pretty deep in the boonies, so this is really great. I will add here that while the Nokia Here maps program doesn't have as much ""places"" detail as Google maps, it does give you the option to download the maps to the phone so you can view it offline. Handy feature for those aforementioned trips to the boonies. The maps themselves are good as well, and I like the directions feature better than Google maps. -Camera. The camera is great, it is a champ in low light conditions and the xenon flash produces great looking (if not quite true to life) colors, I love it. That's all I am going to say on he camera, but there are lost of detailed review of it out there. -Screen. The screen is beautiful and the colors are so vibrant. Pics and video look great as well, best phone screen I have owned. Cons: -App selection for app hounds. I have found an app to replace most all that I used on Android, but there is not even close to the selection. The big ones are here though for the most part and the app list is growing daily. -Google integration is not seamless as it is with Android. I hesitate to put this under ""Cons"" because I have gotten Google to work pretty good here. It is not automatic as it is with an Android device however. The niggle is Google Calender, it doesn't integrate fabulously yet because Google hasn't supported WP8 with an app, but it does work via the email section with alerts etc..., you just have to use the Google mobile site to work with the calender itself. Google maps must be used on the mobile site as well. -Can't expand internal storage. The 928 has 32GB of internal storage, so you have a lot on board, but you can't install any more. This is mitigated by really easy and free access to MS SkyDrive. You can set the phone up to automatically backup your pics, videos, docs, whatever to SkyDrive so you don't need to keep everything on the device. I don't mind but other might, so I am including it on the ""Cons"" list. -Can't replace the battery manually. I never carried an extra battery with me until I got my Droid, and I haven't carried one since I got rid of my Droid, so there's that. I also have a roll up solar charging mat I carry in my backpack, so I don't need an extra battery when I go out in the boonies. If my internal battery starts to significantly degrade before my 2 year contract is up, this will turn into a problem for me. These are the only negatives I can come up with yet, but I will edit my review if I come up with some more. I was initially worried about committing to two years of WP8, but I couldn't be happier with my choice. It's rare to get a truly superior option for a dirt cheap price, and that's what compelled me to write this review.",11.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

However. . . this is not a knock on the phone, but the Windows operating system. Microsoft has amazing ""Family Safety"" settings for all their products except... the Windows phone. You can set it up so that kids cannot purchase apps and only have access to downloading kid friendly games, but you cannot apply the internet filtering settings, which apply the kid's PC account, to their phone account. There are also not a lot of kid safety apps, browsers, or options on the Windows phone.

They say under ""Settings then click About"" I remind them I can't get to settings. They fail to resolve my warranty issues. Promise to call me back and fail.

Cons: fingerprint reader works when it feels to, performance is sluggish at times, camera is a bit slow. The biggest con is that you cannot use a micro SD as internal storage only as an external. This is a huge deal breaker for me. Wish I had known this before buying this phone. I am stuck with it now. I really hope Nokia resolves this in an update. Will update review if they do.

1850,B00ACZ0DUA,DidierTX,4,29-Apr-14,True,Watch out for the red Nokia Screen of death...,"Had a big scare with this phone, which is why I am taking 1 star off. When I turned it on all I could see was a red screen with a white Nokia logo at the top. Being new to WP8 I waited, and waited, did some research online, to no avail, did a soft reset, a hard reset. Nothing but a red screen. Had to go the Nokia website to download the Recovery Program, which for some reason was hard to install, run and make it work on my Windows 8 laptop (at first would not let me install it because W8 thought it was suspicious... doesn't Microsoft own Nokia now??, then the program wouldn't find the phone, then the download would stop after a few seconds or minutes but eventually finished - WAY TOO HARD!), but eventually I was able to re-install the OS and it started. Been working fine since then. Coming from years as an iPhone owner, there are some good and some less good. And WP 8.1 is coming so that should make things better. I am missing some apps but found some decent new ones. Battery is better than on my iPhone 5. Battery saver is useful, so is the ability to block some apps from running in the background. Screen is gorgeous, but that phone is a brick. Geesh, it's heavy. No case on that one! Dedicated phone button works well to wake up the phone and take a pic, but that process is far from quick, takes a few seconds. I have AT&T by the way. Was able to sync music from iTunes on my Mac (only non-DRM songs). Some odd things. Be prepared to enter your microsoft password a gazillion times - annoying. Phone numbers have to be entered with a +1 to be recognized by sms app, and the mail app doesn't like large inboxes. Coming from an iPhone 5 this is fast enough.

14154,B071ZDQ6MV,dunelt_1954,5,28-Sep-17,True,Pick of the (Amazon Prime Exclusive) Litter,"This is a replacement for a Moto X Pure, which Lenovo has seen fit to not update since Android 6 and December 2016 security update. It has received updates to Android 7.1.1 and the September 2017 security update, so, so far, so good. While the SD 430 does not benchmark high with some tests, it is more than adequate for the functions that I use, that is, browsing, FTP client, email, and some network utilities such as Signal Check, NetScan, etc. I don't really play games, so cannot evaluate the capacity to keep up in that area. The display is quite bright and has nice color balance and resolution. Not the PPI spec of more expensive phones, but better than my 53 year old eyes. GPS finds satellites quickly, and without undue battery consumption. The coverage is as good, if not better, than the Moto ""flagship"" it replaced, on T-Mobile in Indiana. Camera is quite impressive for the price. Certainly not in the same league as a serious, stand alone camera, but very credible for snapping targets of opportunity and producing presentable results. I haven't used the Bluetooth function for a headset, but have found it works fine with OBD II Bluetooth readers for automotive diagnostics, a Polar Wearlink heartrate monitor, and Withings Body Analyzer scale. There are several Amazon Prime Exclusive phones available that appear to have an edge in specs to cost. The Moto G5 and Alcatel Idol 5 are both examples. Based on the poor performance of Lenovo providing updates for the Moto X Pure, anything Motorola is out of my consideration. I don't have any experience with Alcatel, but the reputed build quality is not at all comparable to the Nokia. The Nokia 6 really has a solid look and feel, 2 weeks is definitely not enough for an endurance evaluation, but based on their propensity to over-engineer mechanically in past designs, and with the statements of future support with OTA updates, it appears the best all-around option for the money.",22.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

4147,B00KM10ITK,Tim Collins,5,28-Sep-15,True,"Windows? Yeah, Not Too Shabby!","I have read many of the reviews from others about this phone not being unlocked. I ordered one anyway and mine was unlocked. I believe this is a seller issue. Now onto the phone, this is a fairly powerful phone for the price and it has expandable memory which is quite nice. Mine came with AT&T branding and of course their bloatware. The bloatware is easily removed and the phone is working just fine. I also read some reviews that stated the phone wasn't new. Again, I think this is a seller issue, my phone came in mint condition in with a charger in a Nokia 635 box with instruction book. The wrapping over the phone even included the unlock code just in case something should happen and the phone should lock. Pros: Cortana is great, helpful, and funny. She is more robust than Siri and features a more natural sounding speaking voice. She still has some hiccups, but she is very useful. If you are bored, ask her to play the movie game. Need some entertainment? Ask her to sing a song. MS Office integration is a huge plus especially when it comes to revising reports on the go. The Store has some nice apps in it. I shied away from Windows phones for quite some time after being told they didn't have many apps, but I am impressed with the selection offered. Fast phone for the price. This phone won't compete with the latest Galaxy S6 or IPhone, but if you don't need run multiple windows or apps at the same time, then this phone is perfect. Connect with your Microsoft account. You can connect with your Microsoft account and access documents that you have stored in the cloud, very useful if you are trying to work on the go. The battery life on this phone is impressive, but it can vary depending on what apps you are running. Nokia is known for their battery life and this one doesn't disappoint. On a normal day, this phone will last all day and late into the night. This is based on moderate web usage, media streaming, and phone calls. Cons: 5MP camera isn't bad, but it lacks a flash. No front facing camera for Skype. The Store, some apps are good, but others are downright ugly. There are a few apps that it seems like developers forgot. Screen seems to scratch easily. I had the phone in my pocket and it managed to get a few minor scratches. They don't affect the display, but they look bad in the light. If you are looking to upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out, you need to make sure that the phone is running Denim not Cyan as this one does. Depending on your carrier, you can upgrade to Denim immediately upon receiving your phone. Ask your carrier about this or do a quick search online. The Bottom Line If you are looking for a phone that is like old faithful, then this is for you. If you need the latest and greatest hardware and IOS, then this isn't for you. This phone doesn't offer the customization of an Android, so if you like the idea of playing around with the design, skip this phone. For the price, this phone performs above what I would expect. It's a shame that these phones haven't quite caught on because they certainly have earned their spot in the market.",6.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Unlocked-Windows-Quad-Core/dp/B00KM10ITK,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WZWpJTYmL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00KM10ITK,693,103.98,0.0
2309,B00CQAODG4,Amazon Customer,5,28-Sep-13,True,Wow,"I'm shocked. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I'm an avid Android phone use--all the way back to the first Droid Eris but between my Android tablet, phone, was getting bored with the os (I know, I'm weird) plus I used to have a Nokia phone way back in the day before smartphones and it was an awesome device. I really wanted to try another Nokia. I don't really play games or watch movies on my phone as much as some people, I use my tablet for that. I look a great phone, apps for weather, news, facebook, twitter, and a great camera. The camera was a selling point because mine had an 10 mp camera, but just wasn't that great. I am so surprised at how many features this phone has that my droid does. I can talk my texts which is a must, wireless charging is a must (I'll never buy another phone without it), speak my calls or my webpages and the voice pickup is very accurate. The one thing that surprised me the most was you can talk and tell your text messages to send which on Android you always had to hit the send button which defeated the hands off approach. The Nokia maps is great. Ability to have those offline as well as music app download offline is really great. Call quality on this thing is amazing, just as I thought it would be. Speaker and speaker phone is also great. The speaker phone hardly picks up any background swoosh noise or anything, which is nice for the person on the other end of the call. You can customize the tiles and make them as big or small as you want, so if you like a picture on your phone, make the tile bigger. My gmail and all my email accounts come over flawlessly to this phone as well as all of my contacts from my gmail side. Like I said, I'm truly shocked--I wasn't expecting to like this phone very much but the free price tag really was appealing. Oh, camera is awesome! Screen is nice and bright even in sunlight.

While it is a stylish phone of good build quality, you cannot judge a book by it's cover - which is the only place where the quality of this phone shines. It's pretty, but..... So, Microsoft made a phone that is already obsolete, cannot use ANY instant messaging applications or multitask properly, and has numerous flaws that are just add up to a frustrating experience. Not to mention that suppliers and third party companies are avoiding the Windows phone platform almost entirely. Go to the electronics store and try comparing how many accessories you can find for all the other phones with what you can find for the Lumia 900 - it's beyond sad. And the software!! I had a Blackberry that ran the mobile MS Office applications with better functionality and feature-set than the MS hardware, MS software combination of the Lumia. And MS owns Skype but wait, wait... nope, it doesn't work on the Lumia. (unless you disable your screen from timing out {dead battery} and keep Skype as the running app on the screen {switch to another app and Skype logs out}) Running one app works fine, but how smart is it to install an instant messaging application on a phone that cannot run instant messaging while you're doing something like, let's say, looking at the home screen of the phone to see what time it is. Pathetic. I'm a sucker who used to have faith in Microsoft products, so I gave this phone a chance and believed all the fan-boy hyped reviews. Repeat - I am the sucker. Please, don't join the crowd of disappointed people who are now wondering if they can find anyone stupid enough to buy a used Lumia off of them so that they can escape to the capable platform of Android or, dare I say it, Apple (and I hate Apple). If you love a pretty box and don't care about functionality - go for it, but if you actually want a capable smart-phone please save yourself before it's too late and forget this phone ever existed (like MS already did).",8.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0

1660,B00A2V7BA4,Wade Dorrell,5,28-Nov-12,False,Epic,"The Lumia 920 is downright epic. The screen is beautiful, and you'll definitely start to see the pixels when reading on other screens (aside from one of Apple's 'Retina' screens, of course, which pack in the pixels similarly.) The camera is fantastic in bright or low light, and by default it takes slightly wide-angle 16:9 shots which have a unique look, or you can select 4:3, or crop the images to any dimensions you like after the fact, and there are Nokia apps integrated into camera experience that do panorama & other composed content. Although the phone seems heavy initially it's definitely sturdy enough not to need a case (this is no glass-on-two-sides hardware.) Caseless it's quite comparable to the rest of the cased-field, and the color and quality of the device is nicer than any case I can afford. I prefer the matte finish cyan/black to the gloss finish red/yellow/white because the matte texture feels softer, like suede... the gloss texture feels like glass. Battery life seemed herky-jerky at first (it'd stick at 100%, then the phone would heat up during active use and burn off 10% chunks in matter of minutes, and then it'd hold out at 30% overnight), but it seems to have mellowed out after a week. I don't worry about it much given a year's experience with Windows Phone 7's ""battery saver."" If you ever do go on a cable-free bender with the phone and burn it down to 20%, this will keep the phone alive for calls & on-demand use for a good number of hours. The browser (IE 10) is worth mentioning. I do a lot of web reading on the phone and because of this browser & the screen size/resolution I can recommend no other phone as good for this as the 920. It is FAST, and the primary button shown in the browser can be changed to fit how you like to navigate between pages. You can set it to open webpages in new tabs instead of trying to maintain tabs which allows you to queue up several paths to read down easily. And you can pin pages straight to the home screen, a la iPhone/iPad. Finally, the ""Kid's Corner"" is a nice way to keep your kids away from emails, OneNotes, and such if you allow them to play games or use other apps on your phone. They can even pick a color & lock screen of their own.

The Windows Phone 8 interface is by far the best interface of any smartphone on the market. The build quality of the Nokia phone is unsurpassed. The phone is simple to use, very bright, takes awesome pictures, GPS just works (on or off-line), the battery life is excellent, has awesome wireless charging, effortless to transfer all my contacts, music, etc from iTunes. The phone doesn't have hundreds of thousands of apps but I wrote down all the apps that i used with my Iphone and was able to get ALL the major apps on the new platform. I use free text messaging (text me), whats app, amazon, cnn, home depot, bloomberg, chase, ebay, flixster, delta, groupon, facebook, kayak, paypal, youtube, zillow just to name a few. I also like the fact that it comes with Microsoft Office, including OneNote, so that I can stay productive. I am in total control on this phone with the live tiles and it just intuitively works and is simple. Also, for $99 you just can't get any better.

I went to tmobile and had my SIM card cut down for free so that was easy. I played with it all weekend and it worked great until I left my house and tried to use my data plan for internet and send pictures.. I went back to tmobile to see if they could set it up for me and they couldn't. the guy said, ""oh didn't anyone tell you our 4G data plans don't work on unlocked phones."" And handed me back the phone. I of course found out from the tmobile website that they have a code or a series of APN and MMS codes to use, but I tried that and it still didn't work.. So now I'm waiting for my job's IT guy to come back from vacation to figure this out for me.. Other wise I love the phone and I'm just sending pictures if I want to by email.

22340,B07N11SM58,David Chen,4,28-Mar-19,True,Not Good enough to be a flagship phone,"I've been waiting for Nokia to make a true flagship phone. After a few weeks of using it, I am really satisfied with the overal quality of this phone, but I would talk about the downside of this phone. It has nice cameras. All the good reviews are talking about the cameras, and they are really that good. But the bugs of the camera app was pissing me off: 1. The app sometimes randomly popped out a ""cannot connect to the camera"" error and I don't know why. I guess it's a software problem yet to be fixed. 2. It lags. Open the camera app need 1 sec, swithing to different mode (e.g. photo to square) takes 1 sec, post-processing takes 2 sec(this lag is understandable due to the quintuple camera setup) 3. When using the camera, battery drained really fast. This shouldn't be normal to a flagship phone. So I would say, the overal user experience of using the camera is not that great. Ironicaly, people are buying this phone for its cameras. The fingerprint sensor is REALLY BAD to be honest. Nokia 9 is clearly not using the top-level in-screen fingerprint sensor solution. You need to try so many times to get your fingerprint registered and you have to press really hard on the screen to get your phone unlock. I guess the ""double tap to wake the phone"" feature kinda affect the fingerprint recognition. Turn it off otherwise the fingerprint unlock process would be so annoying. Everything else of this phone is good but it just can't be my main device. I used camera and fingerprint unlock every single day, and I can't get annoyed by them everyday right? Man, I have to say, love Nokia. Getting phone calls becomes one of my fav things just because I can hear the traditional Nokia ring.

1564,B00A2V7BA4,Doda McCheesle,3,28-Mar-13,False,BEWARE Data usage!,"Greetings... I purchased one of these from AT&T in December, and gave it a whirl. I had similar problems to many others: 1) Poor battery life- I need a charger at home and work, as the thing could not make it all day 2) Gets hot during use, especially video use 3) OUTRAGEOUS and totally inexplicable data usage. THIS IS MY #1 PROBLEM with the Lumia 920... After complaining to AT&T, they swapped out one 920 for a new one. The same problems persisted. After speaking with both AT&T techs (on-line and in AT&T service store), as well as contacting Nokia, I could not get the problems resolved, particularly any explanation for the CRAZY data usage. The thing sits on my desk most of the day, on my company Wi-Fi, and at home it is on Wi-Fi. It is NOT supposed to use up your data plan while on wi-fi-- however, I would get bills from AT&T showing as much as 11 GIGAbytes of use in 1 month. And here's the deal-- after speaking with AT&T, Nokia, and reading on various web sites, I disabled or removed every application anyone could think of that used data (other than Internet explorer and email). No Facebook. No ""live"" tiles. No maps. No Nokia Driving app. No backups or photos/vids to Skydrive. No weather app. etc. etc. But AT&T still claimed seeing data ""bursts"" and spikes throughout the day of sometimes 80Mb... they could not explain any of these bursts (especially since I was supposed to be on Wi-Fi) and quickly refunded ALL of the overage charges on my account for 3 months...which in itself is suspicious (you ever try getting a refund from a phone company?)... Anyway, I finally got AT&T to swap the Nokia Lumia 920 for a Samsung Galaxy S III- which includes a ""data usage"" application... and in one week of having the Galaxy it has used less data than one day of the Lumia 920. With the same email accounts configured. And usings the Samsung data use app, I could see that one 4 minute YouTube video used about 50Mb of data, and email uses very little. So it appears to me that both Lumia 920's that I had were in some way ""defective"". I liked the device in terms of appearance, apps, ease of use-- the Windows 8 was pretty nice, the screen is beautiful, and it otherwise worked well. However, I can't afford to hand AT&T $110/month in overage fees for data I don't choose to use. And a 4 - 6 hour battery life on a device with this large a battery is also pretty unacceptable. Oh well Nokia-- this is called by some your ""last chance"" gadget. Maybe it's your last gasp... If Nokia acknowledges issues and FIXES THEM, either via software updates, or replacing hardware, this would be a 5 star device. As it is in my experience, I give it 3 stars because not everyone appears to be having the issues I had, and the problems MAY be resolvable by future updates.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

2373,B00CQAODG4,Suzanne Amara,5,28-Jun-13,False,I don't think you'll ever miss your iPhone or Android devices,"Upon first laying eyes on the Nokia Lumia 928, you will notice the incredible build quality. It feels extremely natural in your hands, and it is a great weight and size, although compared to other smartphones it is a tad large. However, the size of this smartphone allows for a flawless 1080p HD display. The display on this phone is excellent, and it can even be viewed well from angles or in sunlight. The most prominent feature of this phone is the camera. The Nokia Lumia 928 takes unbelievably clear pictures, videos, and panorama; they look better on the phone than they do in person! It has stabilizing picture technology, and even if you don't have a steady hand the pictures and videos will turn out great. The camera also works exceptionally well in the darkness, better than those of other smartphones. The microphones (there are multiple) all work together to provide a flawless experience, people on the other line report my voice sounding just like it does in person, and voice recognition has yet to fail for me. The Nokia Lumia 928 has ample storage space for all of your needs and it is easy to transfer files between your phone and computer. The speaker on this phone can easily fill a room, and I prefer that in the interface it measures volume on a scale of 1-30, so you are allowed far more customization. That brings us to the next point, the vast customization you are given on the Nokia Lumia 928. Thanks to Windows 8 on this smartphone, the home page is exactly how you want it. You can adjust how big and small tiles are, where they are, what color you want them, if you want them at all, and you can add as many tiles as you want. You can also pick whatever theme of colors you want on your phone, and you can change it depending on your mood. No other operating system can offer such a unique experience that fits around how you use your phone. It is extremely smooth, quick, and easy to use. Internet Explorer, the default internet browser on this phone, works just as well as its competitors on other smartphones. However, with the Windows 8 operating system comes the biggest flaw of this phone, the smaller library of applications in the store. Not all of your favorite applications from IOS and Android will be available in the Windows Store, although many of them or their counterparts are. Don't let this turn you away from this phone, all app core functionality of other smartphones is matched if not surpassed by the Nokia Lumia 928. All of the big name applications are supported anyway, (Skype, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and you will find that you could easily live without some of your past apps on other devices. If you happen to own an Xbox this phone works quite nicely in conjunction with it using Xbox SmartGlass. It is a cool feature, but it doesn't bring too much to the table. There's also a wide variety of games to pick from either on the Xbox Marketplace or on the Windows Store. This Windows Phone also offers Microsoft Office right out of the box which is nifty for editing documents. You won't find yourself bored or having a lack of options, for there are plenty of things to do. The Nokia Lumia 928 takes no time to get used to. The battery life will certainly hold; it will make it through a day's usage. Everything about this phone, whether that be its fast processor and operating system, unprecedented camera, or breathtaking display works together to give you the optimal experience. It is an all around supple phone, and it will serve you well for a couple of years.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

2284,B00CQAODG4,William G.,3,28-Jun-13,False,A decent alternative to the Apple and Google world.,"I've been an Apple person for many years now, but curiosity had me checking out the Lumia 928, and I'm glad I did. Given that this Nokia is a flagship device for Windows Phone 8, it's only fair to compare it to Apple's flagship, the iPhone 5. First things first. The Nokia Lumia 928 is by no means a light phone. At 162 grams (my scale says 166 grams), it's noticeably heavier than the iPhone 5 at 112 grams. This means the Lumia is roughly 50% heavier than the iPhone. The 4.5"" screen on the Lumia 928 puts out 1280x768 pixels vs the 4"" iPhone 5 with 1136x640 resolution. This translates into 334 pixels per inch on the Lumia vs the iPhone 5's 326 pixels per inch. On paper it sounds like the Lumia 928 is the sharper display, but in practice this is not the case. Because of the pentile arrangement of pixels on the Lumia, text especially just comes across a little... fuzzy. It's certainly not awful, and if you've never used an iPhone 4/4S/5 or for example an HTC ONE, you'd perhaps not notice. In any case, this is not the sharpest display on the market - the iPhone 5 is noticeably sharper. The HTC ONE is the sharpest of them all (sharper than the Galaxy S4). The Lumia display is very vibrant, though, due to its OLED display. It's a little too vibrant for some people, but it certainly can't be accused of being washed out! The Camera: The 8.7MP camera on the Lumia 928 really shines. It takes some of the best low-light photos I've seen on a mobile device. It certainly does a better job than my iPhone 5. Very impressive. While I don't care for direct flash devices, the xenon flash here does help in extremely low light, and the Lumia 928 also uses it to help achieve focus. Daytime photos also look fantastic. The bar has been raised here for low-light phone photography, no question. The Phone: I've found the call quality to be excellent, with little/no distortion at the higher volumes. It just works well. The speakerphone is also quite loud. Apps: This is the biggest problem with Windows Phone 8. There are quite simply not enough apps available. If you're thinking of switching from Android, - and especially iOS, you may want to check to see if your favorite apps are even available for the Windows Phone platform. Chances are, - they're not. I downloaded a few of my favorite apps (from iOS) on the Lumia, - ""Plex,"" and ""Words with Friends."" ""Plex"" just didn't run as well over my network, dropping frames from streamed video. And ""Words with Friends"" is just a travesty of an app. All the smoothness is gone. It crashes a lot, doesn't have some of the newer features from Android/iOS (like giving you a word-score total before submitting the word etc). And gaming is a total downer on Windows Phone 8 for several reasons. First, there are very few games available, and the ones that are available just don't run that well on the Lumia 928. This is likely to do with the (relatively speaking) outdated 1.5 Ghz dual-core processor. Functionality: The Lumia 928 situates all its buttons on the right side of the device. The volume up/down, power, and camera button all feel very similar, and it's not at all obvious which way up you're holding the phone when you pick it up. After several days of use, I'm still struggling to find the power button, which is situated in between the volume buttons and the camera button. I wish the power button was at the top of the phone... Overall: I really do like the Windows Phone platform. But it's certainly not perfect. Multitasking is a bit of a mess (you can't close apps unless you go into them and then back out), and the lack of actual good, solid apps is a REAL problem. The other issue is the hardware. While nothing here would be considered ""bad,"" it just doesn't feel flagship enough to compete with Apple and Android's best. Not enough processing power, not enough resolution, too heavy, gets quite hot when playing games etc. All these things conspire against Nokia. That said, if you want a stable alternative to Android/iOS coupled with the absolute best low-light camera on any phone out there, you may just find the Lumia 928 is the phone you. Just make sure the apps you want are there before you make the jump. 3 stars out of 5.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

I use Nokia music all the time to download songs for listening offline. Nokia transit is also very useful when I am traveling. Skype keeps me connected to my loved ones and the weather app provides live weather updates. Basically as far as apps are concerned I am more or less a happy camper.

This phone is by far the most amazing and fun device I have ever owned. After I set it up it just feels alive! ALL other phones I have used were static and feel boring by comparison, I shopped around for my new phone for several months and decided on the Nokia Icon. Physically, the fit and finish is the best I have ever used. The buttons are nice and the travel on them is as close to perfect as I can imagine. I had to see the screen to appreciate it. The colors pop like nothing else I've seen in a mobile device. Although the phone is similar in physical size to other phones with 4""-4.5"" screens this one is 5"" and goes from edge to edge. The phone has built-in wireless charging, NFC and no camera bump. Unlike the iPhone I can talk and use the internet at the same time on Verizon. The primary function I use my phone for besides calls and texting is picture-taking. The 20mp camera is nothing short of jaw-dropping. The images are extremely detailed and the best I have ever seen. Nokia has really spent a lot of time and effort making the camera great. They also created several apps to do cool things with the images. Refocus allows me to decide what I want in focus after shooting the picture. Cinemagraph allows animation in the picture while the rest remains static. There are some of the most innovative and useful apps exclusive to this platform. Photobeamer allows me to share the pictures from my phone with anyone's computer screen. Nokia Beamer allows me to share my phone's screen with anyone, anywhere on their computer. HERE Drive+ has complete offline maps so I don't use ANY data! HERE Maps with LiveSight is totally awesome. When I turn the phone vertically to look down the street, it superimposes the businesses so I see businesses. The images are links to their websites, menus, reviews, etc. DataSense minimizes data which saves $ and allowed me a smaller data plan. Wallet is built-in and seamless for purchases. Windows Phone comes with Kid's Corner built-in. I have 4 children who always want to play games on my phone including Flappy Bird, Angry Birds and whatever else is out there.

20545,B07HD3QC65,Daniel,4,28-Dec-18,True,Great build. Decent camera. Mediocre battery.,"I've had the phone for 2 days now. Quality build that'd I'd expect from Nokia. The glass back isn't as slippery as I thought it would be and looks great. All around, it's a great phone. I love that Android One keeps the phone lite, transitions are smooth, and apps open fast. I haven't noticed any lag as of yet. Battery gets pretty warm while gaming; enough to get uncomfortable to hold. The media speaker is on the bottom which isn't so bad for watching videos or listening to music. Sound is good. But while gaming it's almost impossible to hear bc your hand covers the speaker while holding in landscape. You basically HAVE to use headphones if it's a game you need to hear. The auto HDR mode for videos is nice but, again, makes gaming hard in some cases due to causing the screen to be too sharp. It's a simple fix by turning HDR off is setting, but, also a pain bc you have to switch it off and on. For 320, it'd be nice to have qi charging built in, but given that it's a mid range and comes with type c quick charging AND nfc, it's a great trade off. Decent camera for the price. It's only 12 mp on the rear but the extra d.o.f. sensor combined with live bokeh mode makes up for it. Shutter is fast even in HDR. I haven't tested the slow mo video feature yet but I'm hoping it will record sound. Fingers crossed. All in all this is a solid phone that works great as a mid ranger.

15556,B075FLG6MV,ekacnap,1,28-Dec-17,True,Not the Nokia you remember (garbage can special),"UPDATE May 15 2018 --I woke up this morning but my Nokia 2 did not -- after being a loyal customer, I won't buy Nokia smartphones again unless they are able to get back to their roots of affordable and DURABLE smartphones (see my original review below). I can't stress how light my use of my Nokia 2 was since I bought it at Christmas to use as a secondary phone -- barely at all, and not often even carried around. I've never had a Nokia totally brick before, but this one is bricked. It won't power on. I can only imagine some issue with the integrated battery.. Repair shops won't touch this phone. Meanwhile my Nokia / Microsoft Lumia from 2014 keeps hammering on, and the battery is easily replaced if there is ever an issue. As my Nokia 2 is dead after minimal use and just out-of-warranty, I just bought a Moto G5 Plus (also a sealed battery phone) from a retail big box today as my Android device. Out-of-the-box, the Moto G5 Plus operates light years ahead of the Nokia 2, including MUCH better call quality. If you are looking at the Nokia 2, I would recommend going with the Moto G5 Plus that is nearly identical in size to the Nokia 2 and can be found for under $160 new currently outside of Amazon. *** I'm going to hang onto it through the holidays to see if it improves but my first impressions aren't great. The sound quality on calls does not seem to be as good as past Nokias I've owned -- including Lumias and an XpressMusic. It has started to randomly reboot a few days out of the box, which I never experienced with any previous Nokia I've owned. I am by no means putting my new phone through any paces but I'm concerned that the Nokia 2 does not seem to be very good as a phone or very stable as a smart device. The screen is better than other phones I've owned and the battery life is impressive. We'll see if it somehow smooths out and improves operations but it has already cost me a work call. I suspect there are other happy and frugal Nokia customers looking at this phone but I can't give it a strong recommendation... yet.",21.0,Nokia,"Nokia 2 - Android - 8GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5"" Screen - Black - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B075FLG6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-rum+PvIL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FLG6MV,359,194.97,0.0

22134,B07LBPP4J9,Doug,5,28-Aug-19,False,"Great phone, even if it is a year old, Vanilla Android Pie plus updates makes it a winner","First of all, I just bought the North America single sim variant brand new, not the dual sim Amazon sells. That said.. this is the best Android I've ever used. The phone has very solid build quality; it feels like the same build quality as an iPhone. It's pretty quick, if not exactly lightning fast, still fast enough. It runs intensive things like Android Auto with only slight delays, everything else is pretty fast. The screen is very clear and colors are good, but the backlight brightness could be a touch higher on full setting, it's tricky to see outdoors in sunlight. Cell reception and call quality with T-Mobile USA are good, so good marks for the radios, etc. (I know it's silly, but sometimes phone makers screw that up). The real winner with this phone is the brand + manufacturer + software combination. Nokia (HMD) is based in Finland. The 6.1 is made via Foxconn in Taiwan/China (arguably the best manufacturer in the biz, maker of the iPhone, Intel networking components and motherboards, etc.). And of course, Android One Vanilla from Google itself. This, in my opinion, makes Nokia the only true Pixel competitor (other than maybe One Plus) as it keeps all the things that make Pixel great in the first place.. Vanilla Android, solid hardware, with true Google support start-to-finish. The 6.1 will get Android Q (10), and will continue receiving security updates through 2020. This is a huge win for this phone. For the low price, you get specs similar to the original Pixel XL (certainly older now, but not useless for basic users by any means), a solid Aluminum chassis, Android 9 with an update during setup, Android 10 in a few months, security updates down the road, and an overall solid device with the solid ""NOKIA"" brand inscribed into the aluminum back. It's hard to think what more someone could want for $200. Only shortcomings are it could be a bit better with 4gb of ram (the US variants only have 3gb), plus the battery life is only ok, expect 1 day. Also the snapdragon 630 was a great chip a couple years ago, but it's a bit older now so just keep realistic expectations. All in all though, hard not to love it for the price. It's a great budget alternative to a Pixel 3a XL. Summing it up.. A great bargain alternative to a Pixel 3a XL. True Google Vanilla Android, with updates. Solid brand. Specs are a bit on the bargain end, but for just under $200 it's a very nice phone and one of the best phones in the under $200 price point in mid/late 2019. 5-stars overall EDIT: In viewing this phone next to a Pixel 3a and 3a XL, it's actually sized much more like a 3a, not the XL. It's basically a slightly wider 3a. Just wanted to clear that up. Also, Nokia did confirm the timeframe for Android 10 (Q), late 2019 to very early Q1 2020 for the 6.1. Admittedly, a bit slower than I would have hoped, but Nokia is bringing it to the 6.1 and quite a bit sooner than most other devices by other manufacturers, a few months after the Pixels but not bad.",5.0,Nokia,Nokia 6.1 - Android 9.0 PIE - 32GB microSD - Single Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - 5.Screen - Black,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-6-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07LBPP4J9,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+7tN6sHHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07LBPP4J9,40,0.0,0.0

19379,B07DD71K4D,bookworm,4,27-Sep-18,False,Very good basic smartphone in this price range.,"After much research, I chose the Nokia 3.1 U.S. version. I'm still a bit amazed that anything costing $160 is considered ""a cheap phone"", but this doesn't feel cheap at all. It's very attractive, has very slim bezels so the screen is a decent size even though the phone itself is not one of those huge things. I like that it fits in my hand but is taller to give more screen. The screen resolution is nice and bright and I can actually see it in sunlight. Not perfectly, but it's visible. Pros: Price - not the cheapest phone out there, but still considered cheap by smartphone standards. Definitely cheaper than the flagship androids. I've had those and, except for the camera, they aren't worth the money. Nokia isn't a Chinese phone and that meant a lot to me. Appearance and the sturdy feel. This is an attractive, slender phone. Mine is black and I love the look. Expandable memory Knowing it only had 16gb storeage and half that was taken by the phone itself, I immediately loaded a SD memory card to internal storeage. The instructions are very easy to follow. Now I have plenty of space. Camera - At first, the photos were dark and I was about to return the phone. Then, I went online, found a Youtube video that showed how to mess with the camera settings for better photos. Now, it takes suprisingly clear photos. Night photos with the flash are grainy, but day photos are nice. Again, more expensive phones will have better cameras, but is it really worth that much more money? Not to me. Headphone jack present. Connecting to wifi was quick and easy. This is an unlocked phone, but I put in an ATT nano sim and it was up and running instantly on 4G. No adjustments needed. Internet loading speed is good. Not lightning fast, but smooth and quick. Apps load quickly too. And I can have several apps open without noticing any slow down. Very little bloatware. The preloaded apps you don't like can be disabled. I disable most of them. Ability to send and receive photos and texts without data enabled. Maybe that's an AT&T thing, but I really appreciate it because I do not keep my data on unless I'm using it. The user interface is typical android and very easy to navigate with the usual ringtones and wallpaper choices. And of course, you can download other ringtones and wallpapers for free in the app store. I downloaded a louder ringtone. Dual slots for sim cards. This will be handy when I travel outside the country. (This phone is an unlocked GSM so will work worldwide.) Cons: Call quality - Manufactors and reviewers give no attention at all anymore to call quality or loudness, so you don't know untili you buy the phone how this will be. But with most of us dumping the landline, we need to be able to make calls. When I receive a call, the caller's voice sounds far away and weak. Putting them on speaker helps but isn't very loud either. I downloaded a volume booster app and this helps enough to get by. Still, the sound quality is a big disappointment. No onboard photo gallery. All photos go to a google cloud. Not my favorite thing because you have to be online to access your pictures. No little red notification light to let you know you have a text or missed call. Not a biggie for me, but for some it might be. Battery life could be better. My very old fifty dollar phone held a charge longer than this phone does. With light to moderate use, I can get a day's battery out of this phone. That's a disappointment, especially since the battery can't be replaced. No carrying an extra just in case. To make the battery last longer, I have all notifications turned off and have disabled the ones I don't want running the background. Old style charger might turn some off. I prefer it and it charges up plenty fast for me. I'd tried several phones before deciding to keep this one and returned all the others. Overall, I'm happy with the Nokia 3.1 and can recommend it to anyone wanting a decent phone with a few perks but who doesn't care about having the high-end, top of the line, status symbol phones.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - White - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DD71K4D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rmi1HiNQL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DD71K4D,64,109.0,0.0

The second problem, not really the phone problem but I cannot tethering the data plan without paying extract $20 a month. This is crippling the capability of the phone, not everyone is rich enough to spend $20 a month just for the tethering. I wish there's a hack, if you know one please let me know.

This phone's picture quality is no where near to N8. It looks fine when you view them on the phone. However, when you view them on computer size by size. It's just not up to the same standard, it's very blurry and not focusing well especially with moving objects. My baby niece looks like a ninja while all she did was turning her head.

2380,B00CQAODG4,Evan Kevelson,4,27-May-13,False,Great bang for Your buck!,"This is my first smart phone, and I am very pleased with 99% of the technical specs on the phone. The phone is incredibly user friendly, THE VIDEO AND PHOTO IMAGING ARE BY FAR SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN IN NYC (BEING SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT A SMART PHONE)ON ANY ANDROID OR APPLE DEVICE. The Battery Life is also significantly better. I can't compare it to the specs on the Galaxy IV because that was a higher price range, but compared to the Galaxy IV & the Apple I5 this has 32 GB of storage! Based on what I have read it is 720 HD resolution for Netflix and YouTube. The Galaxy IV or Apple I5 are both 1080p. For me personally this is not significant for a five inch screen. It records in 1080 HD and can be connected to your TV via an HDMI cable. Although the music app is Nokia Music Tunes, you can upload the majority of your I-tune library via a Windows 7 or 8 PC. The only negative for me regarding this phone is the lack of Apps primarily regarding Video application such as HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, and Amazon Prime video watching. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT ADOBE FLASH PLAYER, hopefully this will change in the near future. I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE PHONE AND I AM ACTUALLY SURPRISED IT DOES NOT SUPPORT IT. IF WAS AWARE OF THIS ADVANCE IT WOULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR FACTOR IN MY PHONE CHOICE. SO FOR SPORT ADDICTS DURING PLAYOFF TIME THIS PHONE WILL NOT HELP YOU AT THE MOMENT. Another MAJOR PLUS if you actually use a smart phone in Business; is that it comes with all Microsoft Office applications, Excel, Word, Outlook, Notebook, and Power Point. If you decide to get this phone I highly recommend you attain the phone here or at Best Buy, a Verizon store or Verizon online will cost you double which is simply not necessary. When I saw how it was priced online, here and other sites, I was disgusted with Verizon. I was eligible for an upgrade, but the only difference in the end between myself as an existing Verizon customer, and a new Verizon customer (the service as a carrier is superior) was a mere 5 dollars. I hope the better business bureau looks into Verizon wireless, because the reality is for existing Verizon customers, it is a bate and switch scam, I was content with my ""dumb"" phone, and their email to me that I would get an upgrade at a discount was simply a means to get me into the store. I could have upgraded my device here and saved A LOT of money. that being said for 50 dollars you are getting an awesome phone that I would put up there with the I phone 5 (with much better battery life) and any high end Android Device. In summary Great Phone- if you are a TV addict you need a Droid or I phone at this juncture and this phone is not for you. As far as Verizon DO NOT buy it at verizonwireless.com or in at a Verizon retail store you will pay double.

15266,B07579T83L,Luke Hendrickson,5,27-Mar-18,True,"Simple, Functional, Easy-to-Use","I did away with my iPhone 6 Plus in April of 2017 and have been trying out a couple different ""dumb"" phones since then (an original Nokia 3310 from the early 2000s, the Punkt MP01, and now the 105). I have to say that I like the Nokia 105 the most of any I have used. The call quality is okay all-in-all (this has a lot to do with being on the almost-defunct 2G network provided to T-Mobile by AT&T) and I can hear conversations rather well even while walking down a busy city street with sirens/honking/yelling people. While on a call, I can pick up a certain tinny/hollow ""echo"" of sorts that, while distracting at first, actually helps me hear people better. Other reviewers have been complaining of the texting being lackluster. The T9 works adequately I think and there's the option within the texting menu to switch languages (so stoked that French is included). While I appreciate that I can use this for texting moderately well, the point of having this phone for me is so that I text less. Thus the overall usability of this feature being a bit limited is the point for me. For a dumb phone with T9 (which is by its very nature harder to use than the interface of a smartphone), Nokia did an appreciable job. The battery life is wonderful since nothing on this phone makes me use it for more than calling or texting people. I have gone several days without charging while using it for many hour-long+ conversations and sporadic texting. It uses the universal micro-USB for charging.

2274,B00CQAODG4,WolfPup,5,27-Jun-13,False,Nokia's high end phone is pretty great,"Nokia's Lumia 928 is pretty much the big high end Windows Phone 8 phone right now. As such, it's unsurprisingly a pretty great phone. Nokia's always been known for good reception. The screen is high quality and a pretty nice size (I'm increasingly leaning towards liking even larger screens, but 4.5"" isn't bad). It's got tech in it for dealing with sun glare, and is supposed to work even if you're wearing gloves (though I haven't tried, since...well, it's 85 degrees out!) The CPU/GPU/RAM are all high end. (You can get quad core CPUs on high end Android phones, but I've found Windows Phone 8 seems to be a much faster OS-it feels fast even on the low end Nokia 521, much less this 928, and I doubt much software actually takes advantage of more than 2 cores on mobile devices like this) It's also got a great camera-apparently the best low light performance of any phone. CNET's pictures show it clearly better than even HTC's One or Apple's iPhone 5, and it absolutely destroys Samsung's Galaxy S4. The camera even has a xenon flash, which is incredibly rare for a phone. One of the things I love about both iOS and Windows Phone 8 as compared to Android is how the OS doesn't come mucked up by a third party skin running over the top, like most android phones do. Besides giving phones a consistent interface, this also means Windows Phones can get updates faster-the updates don't have to be customized so much for every phone, the way they do for most Android devices. Instead of obnoxious custom skins, Windows Phone manufacturers are allowed to include custom programs, either on the phone, or available in the ""app"" store, which only run on that manufacturer's phones. Nokia by far has the most and best programs available for their phones. My favorite by far is Nokia's ""drive"" program, which is basically the equivalent of TomTom's software on iOS or Android, only Nokia gives it to you free. Maps get installed on the phone itself, so you don't waste data doing navigation, and navigation works even if you don't have a data connection. I'm not sure that Nokia's program is as good as TomTom's, but it still works pretty well, and is an amazing bonus for free! I personally like Windows Phone 8 quite a bit. I think WP8's start screen is quite a bit better than iOS or Android's. ""Tiles"" are kind of the equivalent of program icons on iOS or Android, but there are three tile sizes. You can also pin things like individual contacts to the start screen as a tile. In my case there are two people I contact most often, so I have both pinned as tiles right on the start screen, and any calls or texts or emails from them show up on the tiles, separately from the main phone or texting program. Things like that make Windows Phone really customizable compared to the competition. ""Live tiles"" are kind of neat too, although mostly the Weather Channel program is the only one that I use that actually updates with anything particularly useful (since programs on iOS can update with the number of new texts/voicemails, etc. also). From the start screen, a quick swipe to the left pulls up an alphabetical list of all programs installed on the phone. The interface is generally just very intuitive and clean. The email, texting, web browser, etc. are all good too. Pretty intuitive, fast, and work like you'd expect. There are a lot of there little things I like about WP8 too. The lock screen can use the Bing Desktop picture-like a smaller version of the same picture you can get on a Windows PC every day can just automatically gets used as your lock screen, which is a LOT more interesting and appealing than what Android and iOS do. Even the way the lock screen kind of bounces is intuitive and appealing. It's just small things here and there that really make Windows Phone pleasant to use, particularly compared to Android...it just feels a lot faster and more intuitive. I had a funny moment a week ago where my friend's android phone's network connection was refusing to work, while I'm just talking to my phone to pull up movie listings. I felt like we were in some kind of Windows Phone ad lol One thing I DON'T like about WP8-for whatever reason, the time and reception bars at the top tend to be hidden more often than on iOS. I suppose Microsoft's thinking is that that gives you more screen real-estate. True, and maybe it's just psychological, but I prefer seeing the reception bars, battery, and time up there most of the time. A quick swipe down from the top, but still. iOS programs CAN hide that bar, but most programs (outside of games or full screen video) tend to leave it up there. The other oddity-for some reason there's no way to lock screen orientation. That can be useful (for example) to prevent the screen from rotating if you're lying in bed and trying to read something. I think individual programs can include screen orientation lock though. Also, for me, iOS handles podcasts FAR better than anything else. Android has no native podcast ability at all, and there's no good way to manage podcasts on a PC and sync, like what iTunes gives you. Windows Phone 8 is better, though still nowhere near as good as iOS. WP8 has podcast management built in to the phone-you can subscribe to stuff, have it auto-download when you're on Wifi, etc. Problem is, there's still not a great way to sync it with a PC if you want to. Files can be manually copied between a PC and windows phone just like to any drive, and Microsoft does have a pretty nice, easy to use ""Windows Phone"" program for syncing files (available as both a Windows 8 ""app"", and a more full featured desktop version for any version of Windows). That program even lets you synchronize with iTunes if you want to, but in my experience it's not flawless, the way it would be syncing an iPod/iphone, at least for podcasts. Playback position doesn't get saved right. Play counts don't seem to work quite right, etc. At least it runs well...honestly every single Android syncing equivalent has been a mess, often even containing malware, and never working right. At least this desktop program is light weight, easy to use, and built by Microsoft. I think MAYBE if you ONLY wanted to have podcasts on your phone, then Windows Phone would work roughly as well as an iPhone. Or of course if you only care about syncing music, it should work just fine. I don't like the Windows Phone media player as well as iOS', but still, it more or less gets the job done as you'd expect, and has lock screen controls like iOS, etc. (I do wonder if the 8.1 update coming later this year will make some of this stuff even better). I'll mention that while Windows Phone lags behind iOS and Android in terms of the total number of programs available, I've actually found more programs on it I care about than on Android. Most of the ""big"" stuff seems to be here. A lot of the same games are available, although iOS is still best for that. (It is cool that games can have achievement points just like Xbox and PC games.) I'm sure it'll keep getting better, but really most everything I want is already available, though obviously that may not be the case for everyone. It's worth mentioning that when you download programs for Android, Google gives out your personal info to the developer. Microsoft (and I guess Apple?) don't, which I appreciate, and which is another reason I like Windows Phone better than Android for programs. I'll probably think of other things to say about it all, but bottom line is I mostly really love my Nokia Lumia 928, and mostly love Windows Phone 8. I really wish it could match iOS for podcast support, but for the most part it's pretty awesome, and well worth considering.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

14214,B071ZDQ6MV,Paul Lite,4,27-Jul-17,True,APN Settings must be added manually for MVNO!,"It's a bumpy ride for me. I was so excited for Nokia to come back. I pre-ordered the silver one and received last Friday (July 21, 2017). I first charged it for a whole night and then proceeded to set it up at home. Put in a SIM card from H2O/easyGo, a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), using AT&T Wireless Network. Home WiFi connection was fine and restored / copied the needed apps from Moto G. I only saw 3G connection; however, I know I have 4G coverage around my house since the other two phones can get AT&T 4G. Google for ""easyGO APN Settings"", and then I manually added these APN settings from bestmvno. Finally I've got 4G signal at home and in any open areas. APN setting is located at Settings -> Cellular network settings -> Access Point Names. The 2nd issue has to do with Home WiFi, which worked perfectly fine for two days. Then suddenly, my Nokia 6 could not find my home WiFi, even if I typed it in manually. This issue was described in other people's feedback, too. After much frustration, I updated my router's firmware and restored all the settings to its default. My Nokia 6 eventually could connect to it again after the router was rebooted. I am wondering if my initial router's gateway IP address was set to the 192.168.2.1, while the default IP is typically 192.168.0.1. Then the question was why it worked for two days. All my other devices, including other smart phones and PCs, can connect to my router, regardless of the gateway IP address being 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.0.1. As other reviews mentioned, this might have resulted from channel #, since my router uses the default ""auto"". My router might have changed channel somehow in between working fine initially and stopping working. The 3rd issue lies in that I could not connect to AT&T wireless network in my office, while my old Moto G (1st Gen) could most of time. I know the wireless signal is not very strong in my office. But, I would expect that Nokia 6 works better than Moto G. Overall speaking, it's a great phone at this price point, otherwise. I changed my rating to 4 stars.",4.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

Millman,5,27-Feb-14,False,Sold on the new Microsoft environment and the Icon phone is great!,"To put this review in context, I've upgraded my cell phone every couple of years since 1992 when I had my first Motorola brick; so I've owned a lot of cell phones and all the smart ones. I'm not a fan of Apple products but my spouse has one so I'm not unfamiliar with them. I'm an IT professional and I've worked with so many different operating systems I've lost count but half a dozen Unix variants, 3-4 Linux Variants, every version of Windows since 1.0, and the Apple OS. I run both a personal Google Identity and Google Apps for my small business. I've had my phone for a week and I bought the DT910 charger for my desk and the DT900 for traveling. This phone is just wonderful, I gave the Verizon store clerk my Microsoft identity name and added my password when she passed it to me. By the time I got home the phone had completely synchronized with my desktop and laptop. It's seamless: just different windows into the same ""ME"". The sound quality is great; the camera is brilliant (I'm an amateur photographer with several thousand in semi-pro equipment); I can link together all my contacts various identities (google, skype, facebook, etc) into a single unified contact list; Facebook, Kindle, Audible, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft Office, all work great. Before I bought the phone the Verizon folks told me that no one liked the Windows phone because it didn't run all their apps. And there are some applications that are not available yet for Windows 8. The only one I miss is TripIt but this is more than made up for by the seamless integration with Microsoft Office. (Update: I found TripIt) I wanted a working phone that integrated seamlessly into my work environment; gives me a great camera, delivers my core communication needs; the Icon hit that target dead on.

Chance came when i lost my ip5, a little bit of tiring of using apple products, not saying that they are bad or anything, they are all decent products to my opinion. In fact, i'm a .net developer and used to be Nokia fan long time ago, why not trying this new combination of Nokia and MS product where you can actually play around with the technology and new (cool?) stuff. Enough for introduction, now the phone, with quite some doubt, however, after reading lots of reviews, i bought one. First impression, awesome layout, very nice material, some sayings bulky, heavy, but i don't see it that way, it fit in hand, feeling solid and great, big screen display, nice camera, awesome Nokia's navigation (many thanks to this feature), fast and responsive, 32Gb memory as external storage, additional 7Gb Skydrive, 4G LTE support (super fast), Office, Kid's Corner feature (i found it very useful), you can actually download Map and disconnect Data Network for saving data plan, live update from front end screen, conserve for saving battery when running low, apps is quite out there, certainly not comparable with Apple Store, but i think it would be soon, ... and a lot more as others mentioned already. It certainly clears my doubt, brought back the hope that Nokia can come back one day, and important thing is, I don't have the feeling missing my Ip5. One minor thing about this new 920 and WindowPhone 8 Os, it's quite strictly in setting up the Environment for dev (in case you want to go this round), for fully support, it requires Windows 8 64bit, x64 bit CPU, VS2012 (Pro and up), and requirement for CPU from i3, i5, i7 (or CPU that support SLAT, and one other thing i can't remember now) in order to install the Emulator. I was stuck with this since my desktop was old, and Core2Duo CPU doesn't support this. However, not that bad, i still can install most of everything to support to WP7.8 OS, or you may want to register as MS Window phone Dev and you can use your real device for testing purpose. For those still using Wins 7 and VS2010, it still a good choice since there are SDKs out there... Certainly, i need to adapt to the differences btw the 2 products, but it's worth doing so.

2239,B00CQAODG4,Ashe,2,27-Aug-13,True,GREAT OS POOR DESIGN +UPDATE 9/2,"First off, my husband and I have owned cell phones, tablets, MP4's and PDA's for the past 10 years, each one lasting two years or more. This is the first mobile device that has broken within the first month from ONE drop. Major design flaw. While the glass extending beyond the LCD nearly to the edge of the phone, blunt squared edges and smooth matte black back might make for a sleek look, It also makes for an easy to shatter screen. The corner of the phone was nicked (while wearing a case) during a drop and the front screen still shattered. I voiced my concerns to Nokia (though I knew it wouldnt matter since dropping is misuse and abuse and not covered by warranty) and received a catch all e-mail. While I did drop the phone, I feel that a top brand should be designed to withstand a few minor impacts. My children both own kindles which have really taken a beating with no issues, so I do not think it is unrealistic for a product that costs 2-3x as much to be held to the same standard. Nope. ONE 2-3 foot drop was all it took. Also the glass screen is integrated, so replacement is costly costing more than half the original retail price. If youre not dissuaded by this review, make sure you have the phone insured and make sure you are willing to pay a 100 deductible if you ever misuse (drop) your cell phone. OTHERWISE the phone has a lot of great features, especially if you sync with your other windows 8 devices and skydrive. Some of my favorite features are the photos I take are AUTOMATICALLY uploaded to my windows account to be accessed on my other devices, and documents, photos, etc from my other devices are accessible on my phone. If you use email and social media automatic updates are easy and convenient. Contact syncs with facebook is nice, not only does it sync prof. pictures with your phone, it also syncs contact info such as email addresses, cell numbers birthdates etc. Predownloaded GPS was a great feature. The Here City Lens was really neat concept but not something I would use for practicality. It shows way too many closed businesses, but might be useful for someone in a larger town/city. I was able to find practical apps that fit my needs. I love the windows phone website where you can quickly locate your phone for free (great if this is a childs phone.) Also if you loose your phone you can actiate a loud ring to help locate it (like a panic button.) If privacy is a concern, you can also choose to wipe a lost phone remotely. Overall LOVED the windows OS, but Nokia should design more practical phones that they are willing to stand behind. Who doesnt drop a phone? Would recommend a Windows 8 phone, cant do the same for a Nokia. ************ A week after my initial review I received a prompt that an update was required on my phone (I had set my phone to require prompts and not perform autoupdates.) I choose to perform the update and when the phone restarted it would flash between various welcome screens. I had no way to remove the battery or power the phone off so it cycled through these welcome screens until the battery was drained. I plugged the phone in and now it will not power on at all. Because of the previously cracked screen the warranty is void.

4971,B00O15MWOM,Andrew_B,3,27-Apr-15,False,Mediocre but good enough as a transitional phone.,"I purchased this as a go between until I received my Amazon Fire Phone that I am transitioning to from a Blackberry Z10. I have had it for about a week now and am slowly growing tired of this phone. At first its charming and fun to use at first but it quickly becomes saddled with issues. Apps will randomly close on their own, including built in ones, some web pages will make Internet Explorer close and it does not like to multitask due to its lower end ram specs. I would suggest using as many third party apps to replace the built in ones as possible. Many apps seem to handle tasks better and more efficiently. Below is a list of the apps that I suggest you use in place of their counter parts and why: For Internet Explorer - Opera Web Browser - It uses less data, less memory and most web pages will load properly. For Maps - Here Drive + - It has voice navigation and uses downloaded maps from Maps. For Messaging - BBM - If you know enough people who use BBM I would suggest using this over texting as the texting app can be unreliable. I will update the list above as I find better apps available. I have started to like the Windows 8 operating system but it is still lacking. The interface does not seem clean, the app list isn't optimized for quickly finding specific apps. I will say that the do have the feature to choose a letter and jump to it in the list but this still is not as efficient as it could be. The app selection is limited, therefore if you are coming from Android or IOS you will be disappointed. Gaming on the phone is enjoyable and many games can be found for free and work rather smoothly even with limited hardware resources. Even with the Windows 10 Tech Preview, given all the bugs in a system still under development, does not change the phones downfalls when it comes to layout and efficiency. I feel that Microsoft is making the same mistakes for this phone as they did the Zune.",2.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 530 White - No Contract (T-Mobile),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-530-White-Contract/dp/B00O15MWOM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ba7gOGt5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00O15MWOM,378,133.28,0.0
1446,B00A2V7BA4,Manzoor E Elahi,5,27-Apr-13,False,A Perfect Upgrade,"Last year I bought a Black Lumia 900 from AT&T. Not upgrade eligible yet, but instead got a unlocked 920 as a winning. The phone's review will have to incorporate bits from the OS too, so let's be done with that first. Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there. Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5"", which in my opinion is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. The high PPI screen is a joy to use. It retains 900's slightly squarer 15:9 aspect ratio, and the increased PPI makes it one of the best display in the market. The curved display's edge meets the rest of the body flawlessly, making the phone a joy to hold. The poly-carbonate's texture is simply luxurious. The material also means that color won't come off even if scratched. Nokia has used a new kind of coating on the logo, and the three capacitive keys that makes it really easy to see them even when the back-light is off. Slightly raised position of the keys is also a very welcome change, makes it very hard to accidentally hit them now. The camera is hands off the best phone-camera out there, nothing more to say there. Although the from camera is less than stellar. A few issues that still remain is that I want the headphone port at bottom and the micro-USB port on top of the device, it has it in opposite order, although to be fair every OEM is guilty of this offense, except only Apple is now putting headphone port at bottom. At least we get a camera button with windows phones. The phone is indeed a little heavy. 900 is my opinion had the perfect weight. While 920 has better ergonomics, I find it a little heavier than I would have like. But given the built quality, OIS camera, display quality, 32GB storage etc. being a little heavy is easy to forget.

It does not display emojis, which is a bummer when husband texts cookies as a request and all I see are empty small boxes. It should allow me to remove ""apps"" that came with it, like a Disney game demo that is basically an add I can't get rid of. And finally, it should allow a little more customizability in the basic display. What about Nokia's old List mode? That was great. Or the Go To button?

Prior to purchasing this Nokia device, all four of my smartphones were Windows devices. My Lumia 950 suffered a premature death, so my best option was to move to Android or Apple since the entire Windows Phone platform also died. I've used Android tablets before, so I knew a little bit about what to expect with an Android device. This device has been a bit more glitchy than my Windows phones. I'm not sure if its because Android is more open and customizable, or if it relates specifically to the Nokia 6. Overall, this phone is a great value. It looks great and is built solidly. This was my draw over spending double or more for a Samsung device. It can be a bit sluggish while running multiple apps, but it's not too noticeable. I gave this phone a three-star rating based on two major drawbacks: the call quality is poor and choppy in cars, and the widgets keep disappearing. The widget issue was finally solved by enough system updates and/or using a new launcher application.

My previous phone was the Moto G4 Play which had fantastic battery life, and I was not expecting the Nokia to to compare in this department since it's a more powerful phone with a better screen, but was surprised to find it on mostly on par. The phone looks attractive and minimalist although it is very slippery, so make sure you get a case.

1449,B00A2V7BA4,Kris Garcia,5,26-Nov-12,False,"Solid phone, great OS","I am very happy with my purchase of the Nokia Lumia 920. I've missed Nokia a great deal since the days of the old Nokia brick we all knew and loved. The Operating System: Windows Phone 8 is a very simple and blazingly fast OS. Performing everyday tasks like checking email, texting, calling, and browsing are always just a tap away. Scrolling and screen changes are smooth, and I have not experienced any hitches whatsoever. Although the Windows App store is a bit bare when compared to Apple and Android, it has everything I wanted and more. Heck, I even found a ""Tom and Jerry"" app that has over 150 episodes for my nephew... for free! Nokia's mapping system and Nokia Drive are great additions as well, giving you turn by turn directions when needed. The mapping system is pretty much on par from what I have previously read, and experienced. The OS is the most fetching overall. Design: What can I say... very sexy phone. The colors are truly striking, and it will definitely stand out when you are standing in a sea of white and black (unless white and black are your thing =P ). The phone is extremely sturdy... sometimes I feel like I can chuck it across the room and worry more about the wall than the phone (although I won't do this of course). Yes, the phone is heavier than the iPhone 5, but honestly, It's not something that bothers me. I find it silly that we are complaining about .3 ounces... really?! That extra .3 ounces is going to throw your shoulder out? First world problems I guess... anyways, I personally like to know my phone is in my pocket (which this phone easily slides into and out of). Also, there is no need for a phone cover for this device. The color on the body goes all the way through, so if there are any scratches, you won't really notice. The gorilla glass also reduces the need for a screen cover. My phone actually feels better in my pocket than my girlfriend's iPhone 5 after she encased it in plastic and put a screen protector on it (like most iPhone owners do). Overall, VERY happy with my purchase, and very happy with ATT. I switched from Verizon, but only because ATT has higher LTE speeds in San Diego than Verizon, and their connection has greatly improved.

1685,B00A2V7BA4,James Arnold,4,26-Nov-12,False,"Great Phone, a Bit Slippery","I've been a Windows Phone user since 7 (before 7.5). My previous phone was an HTC Titan, which was a good enough phone, though certain things were not terribly impressive (lower resolution screen, camera was so-so, I wasn't a fan of the lens sticking out on the back, etc). The Lumia 920 is the best phone I've owned to date. I won't review all of Windows Phone 8, though it is worth mentioning that you should know what you're getting yourself into: research your favorite apps, see if there are alternatives if they aren't in the marketplace just yet, and make sure that you're willing to dive in. It can be a bit much to ask people to give up a good Instagram app (there isn't one for WP8 that I know of, though I'm no Instagram user), but the OS is beautiful, functional, and I think makes up for any holes it has. Pros: Great camera (this has been talked about, and while it may not be everything people have wished, it is still wildly impressive; the stabilization isn't as powerful as I'd hoped, but maybe I just have shaky hands). Night photos are a dream, though daytime photos aren't quite as colorful as I'd like. This will allegedly be fixed in a patch, but at this point, that isn't the case. The screen is a dream. Excellent contrast, high resolution (ppi is comparable to the iPhone 5), deep blacks, and saturated colors leave everything looking crisp and pretty. The hardware is solid, though some may complain about the weight. Every single person who has picked my phone up, without exception, has commented on the weight. Some have preferred it (""Wow, it feels heavy, but I like how solid that makes it feel""), while others have been off put by it (""Wow, that's really heavy, glad I don't have to carry it around""). I personally prefer it, though I did get used to larger phones with my HTC Titan (before that I had an iPhone 4, so that change was huge). The buttons on the side depress with a satisfying feel, though this is the norm on most good phones; if your buttons don't feel nice, they will be commented on. Cons: There are two potential cons, and one actual one. The first potential con is the weight, which I addressed above. The second is the sheer size of the phone. It's only slightly smaller (though still thicker) than my Titan was, and that was a beast of a phone. I've got no trouble fitting it in my pockets, but I'm not likely to forget it is there. The physical size is definitely going to be a negative for some, though. The actual con, and the only thing I actively dislike about this phone even as I'm getting accustomed to it, is that the matte surface is slippery. I had hoped it would be grippy, which is why I chose the matte over the glossy (matte = black and cyan, glossy = white, red, and yellow). When I pull the phone out of my pocket, I've made a habit of grabbing it by the screen and the back, rather than the sides (my previous habit). I don't notice any finger-prints (this screen is really nice), but I'm still getting used to grabbing it that way. All in all, this is the best phone I've owned. I love WP8 as a platform, but the hardware makes Nokia's Lumia 920, in my opinion, the flagship device for Windows Phone.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

2379,B00CQAODG4,Rentme,5,26-May-13,False,This should be your next smartphone,"This really should be your next Smartphone! I have lived with Android and the defragmentation of the software releases with different versions on different phones. I have experienced the high cost of the Apple products and have seen so many friends that encased their iphone with a big ugly case. I have also experienced the ""great at first...than behind the times"" Blackberry Smartphones. Now I am experiencing the Windows 8 Phone from Nokia and I can tell you I am not going back to any of the other options. The excellent hardware quality of this phone and the additional Nokia Apps make this a super easy to use and that integrates with my desktop. Other reasons to own this phone: - The offline GPS is fantastic as I never have to worry about having a data connection to get a route (I found out that the Nokia mapping data base powers the majority of the car systems in the world and I can see why) - Nokia music is not something I would buy, but similar to mapping where you can download to your phone and then use without a data connection, this is fantastic to have a HIGH QUALITY sound mix on your phone that doesn't require a data connection to listen to. - Yup.....the camera can't be beat, especially with the Zenon flash and the Nokia Apps for the camera. - Battery charging is another goody that you have love. First, it has a feature that charges the battery up to 40% faster. Although most other new smartphones have this feature now, you really do notice it. Second, you can find the Nokia wireless charging plates for $25 and once you use wireless charging you won't want to fiddle with the plug in cable again. (I bought 2 plates and it is worth it) There are many other items I could list, but most reviewers have already listed them when reviewing Windows Phone 8.

2405,B00CQAODG4,funkyhuman,3,26-May-13,False,"928 has some issues, Verizon's service is bad","After waiting for months, I was very excited about the launch of the Lumia 928. I got this phone on the day of launch at noon time. The Verizon store told me we were the 5th buyer. I bought two, one for me and any wife. I was switching from AT&T. I know this will irk off some people because they will say the phone is good and I am rating the service...please note these phones are essentially married to Verizon. Unless I buy it at full price and then use it with AT&T... it will unusable for me. IMHO the phone and service go hand in hand. Lumia 928: ----------- The phone is very, very good. It is very fast. The UI is fluid and a joy to use. No lag or sluggish behavior like I notice in Android devices, especially noticeable on Android on the very first swipe to left of right (after the phone has been sitting). I was surprised how much faster apps open compared to my old Samsung Focus Windows phone. Screen size is very nice. The weight is just right. The shape is better than the HTC 8X, whose sharp edges digs into your fingers. Most of the apps I need are all there. Some banks' apps are missing but you can easily use their WAP website instead. For others like Disney, well you can only hope they release a Windows Phone version soon. It does however have a few problems; none of them are deal killers. I am known to be picky: 1. The AMOLED screen changes color if you tilt the screen. Dead on the screen is nice, you tilt is a little to the left or right, it becomes bluish. I compared it with my old Samsung Focus...that also has an AMOLED screen, which does not do the same thing. It may not bother you but it bothered me. It was very obvious in screens where the background is white, like while reading e-mail or web pages. Viewing photos also shows the bluish tinge and while it may not matter to the person holding the phone but if you are showing photos to a couple of people standing beside you....well you get the idea. 1.1: AMOLED cannot be dimmed easily. Now this is a serious flaw of this technology. I did not realize until I got a Lumia 920 with a regular IPS LCD display. If you like to read in bed, you will like the non AMOLED screens better. The brightness of a AMOLED screen does not do down a lot. So in a totally dark room, it will still be way too bright to be comfortably read. I searched and found that the inability to dim properly is a hallmark of AMOLED screens. My old Samsung Focus with a AMOLED also used to do the same thing. BTW, in almost all other respects, the AMOLED is better. 2. The camera button has no middle stop. Lumia 920 has a clearly felt ""half press"" to focus stop. You push down a little and the camera focuses, gives a ""ting"" sound....then you press it fully to take a picture. 928 does have that feature but the hardware button does not have a clearly felt half press. This results in out of focus pics (sometimes). 3. The flash is useless. The highly touted flash results in pictures which are too yellow. At first, the white balance seems to be very off. But if you look closely the foreground is properly white balanced but the background is not...it comes out to be very yellow. Maybe the flash ""drops off"" very quickly? To be fair, you can turn off the flash and the pics come out fine. The 920 does not have this problem. I hope a software update will fix this issue. 4. Bluetooth issues. a. Phone behaves strangely with music playback. For example, suppose you were listening to Pandora music in the morning and you stopped playback. Then in the afternoon a call comes in, you take that call. After the call ends, the music starts playing again! I did not play music, so why does the phone play music? Even weird is that at that time I cannot find Pandora running in the background (by keeping the back button held down)! The only way to stop Pandora at that time is to start Pandora again from the apps list, then stop it. Same thing happens if you use something other than Pandora, like the phone's own native application for music. None of my other phones do this. b. It starts playing music when it loses BT connection. For example, you have it paired to your car and listening to music. When you end your journey, you stop the music (actually pause) then get down from the car and walk away. Eventually you will be far enough from the car to lose the BT connection (or the car's BT will switch off). At that time the 928 will suddenly start playing music from its own speakers. None of my other phones do this. c. It drops connection with my Plantronics Voyager Legend. About one or twice a day the BT connection drops, sometimes in the middle of a call. This could be the fault of the Voyager also. d. While paired to the headset, you dial a number using the keypad, the sound sometimes starts coming from the phone. To switch to the BT headset, you have to press the BT button on the call screen...very annoying. Note that this problem does not happen all the time. e. To be fair, I hear that the Nokia 920 also has some of these BT issues. So maybe it is a Windows OS problem? But how come my older Windows 7.8 does not have this problem. Verizon: ------------ 1. Verizon's coverage was much worse than AT&T. I was getting only one bar at home (Woodbridge, VA) and none at work (in downtown DC). In comparison, I get 5 bars and 3 bars with AT&T, respectively. Maybe AT&T's signal penetrates building more easily? They say Verizon's coverage is the best but that was not the case in my experience. Having no connection at work was a deal breaker. 2. Voice quality of Verizon is significantly worse than AT&T. I was surprised how bad it sounded. Even the ringer sounds bad. It sounds like a very low bitrate MP3. People sound garbled inside my home, where I get only one bar. I was having difficulty understanding what the other person is saying. When I dialed 611 to complain to their customer service, I had to tell the rep to repeat again and again...I simply could not understand what she was saying. To be fair, none of the people I called said that they were having any trouble...so it was only on my side. At first I thought it was the lumia 928 but I went to their store and made a couple of calls using Android devices, the sound quality seemed to be the same. I am sure I am being nit-picky here. I am an audiophile at heart. But why does AT&T sound so much better? I googled and noticed many people saying the same thing, most of them saying Verizon's antique CDMA network is to blame. As a result of having service problems I have returned the phones and have been hit with a $140 fee. $35 activation fee + $35 restocking fee on each of our two phones. I am fighting for these fees with Verizon. I have ported my numbers back to AT&T, voice quality is again clear, like a land line. I would advise anyone switching carriers to: A) Thoroughly test the device in the first 2 days B) Find a seller with no restocking fee (e.g. Costco) C) Return it within first 3 days to avoid no refund of the activation fee.",13.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

Please how do you remove all that AT & T stuff? Other than that no complaints. Update, I have had this phone for four months and I can not receive picture that are texted to me and this phone does not work with Family Mobile data plan. I have downloaded updated and turn myself inside out trying to figure out what am I doing wrong. This phone although stating unlock can not be used to almost any but talk text and music storage without AT&T. I left AT&T because they are so expensive and in Chicago calls are dropped constantly I did not want to go back but here I am crawling back to AT&T buying a more expensive and limited data plan just to make this stupid phone work. This is not unlocked as stated and will not work well with other wireless plans with web and pictures don't waste your money.",4.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
2297,B00CQAODG4,Russell Weisfield,3,26-Jul-13,False,So close - but it drops the chalupa,"The Lumia 928 seems to epitomize the saying of being close but no cigar. There are a lot of good things in the phone that are more than praiseworthy. Yet there are also just enough misses to make it tough to live on a platform with little traction. First, the UI is sweet! There really isn't a better interface on the other platforms. Microsoft should be given accolades for finding the right mix of form, functionality, and customization. The lack of color options, however, is a detraction as the monochrome nature of the interface can cause eye strain. Additionally, although Bluetooth is available, MS has restricted the use of some devices such as keyboards. Granted the virtual keyboard is fabulous, but sometimes one just wants a proper tactile keyboard. This is one of those moments where the phone gets close, but not quite. Its got Bluetooth, but not the way it should. Similarly, the ""gloved mode"" of the touchscreen was a major selling point. Alas, by glove they mean something such as a batting glove. Winter and decent leather gloves won't work. NFC is available on the phone, but you cannot transfer files to Android devices which are far more prominent than other Windows phones. The often mentioned Kids Corner works - but is not the separate login you might think. Also advertised is that the phone comes with free music services. Indeed, both Nokia Music and Pandora are free. Pandora, however, is free only until the end of the year and the Nokia Music is no better than other services - unless you pay for the premium version. Another big selling point is the camera. This was the biggest letdown. While good for a smartphone, the depth of the pictures taken paled in comparison to the iPhone and Galaxy. The Lumia also added a bluish tint to the pictures. Nothing horrendous but certainly something distracting. Admittedly, the low light pictures were better than on other smartphones but worse than on many point and shoot or slr cameras. The Panorama mode also was somewhat frustrating as you have to match each shot with a little circle that appears. If as you're moving the camera becomes uncertain where you are, then you have to start that shot again. This can cause a panorama shot to take a few minutes to successfully shoot. Admittedly, having the ""lens"" options is a very cool feature that other OSs should emulate. Especially since there are relatively few useful lenses on the Windows ecosystem. As for the more standard functions, such as outgoing and incoming calls, the Lumia failed here. For some reason the phone would have a tendency to make the call fade in and out or add static. Someone suggested it has to do with the placement of the attena in the phone. When the static or fading didn't happen the call was relatively clear with people on the other end remarking that I was as clear as if I were on a landline. Its nice that WP8 offers caller announce. Its unfortunate, however, that there is no notification center and there won't be one until at least sometime in 2014. Browsing the web was fast with the compression that IE10 offers. Some sites, however, still don't render perfectly (whether you choose mobile or desktop version) and trying to close popups or jquery windows can become bothersome if not outright impossible. This, however, might also have been related to the problem of the touchscreen sometimes being just slightly off and having to press above the desired point rather than directly on it. It would, however, be prudent for IE to have a forward button. The data sense provided by Verizon is something that should be emulate$ every carrier on every OS. Music playback through the headphones was exceptionally clear though lacking on the speaker. Windows Phone, however, does have a problem playing aac or wav files. The speech system offerred by Microsoft is pretty good at identifying what was said by the user, although not so good at actually doing what was asked. In other words, when you record a note, it will be reasonably (not perfectly) accurate in what you say (and even keep a copy of your voice with the text). If you give it a command, however, don't expect it to actually do what you ask. Mostly that is because of the paltry number of command. This will likely improve as more apps make use of the speech functions (currently many apps skip that functionality). The apps, of course, are perhaps the biggest thing hurting Windows Phones right now. True, Nokia's mapping applications are the best out there (shows speed, can eliminate tolls/highways/etc. from your trip), Skype is fully integrated, and there is even Microsoft Office. There is, however, a very long list of missing apps. Even the ones that are present are subpar or costlier when compared to their counterparts on IOS and Droid. Many don't integrate Live Tiles. Even the ones that do, have a tendency to freeze, rendering the app to be little more than an icon on the alphabetized app list. To have a chance at unfreezing it you either have to do a hard re-boot or uninstall/reinstall. The Live Tiles and Voice integration could slay the apps on IOS - but only if companies are willing to develop them for the approximately 3% of global smartphone users with a Windows Phone. Ultimately, this is a phone with so much potential. It feels great to hold and can do many things. Its too bad that many of those things just come up a tad short.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

My Samsung Galaxy 3 couldn't even keep apps running, it couldn't recognize the microcard storage as part of its space so within a couple of weeks it kept refusing to store pictures or download due to ""lack of space"". I hated it. My Nokia Lumia is perfect. The tiles are easily to manipulate and group, storing photos and downloads and putting tiled, grouped links on the bright desktop is a cinch. I never - never - have storage problems because Microsoft knows how to program a device that includes external storage as part of the space; maybe they can send a couple of techs over to Samsung to help out.

15414,B075FL4H89,tom Larson,2,26-Dec-18,False,"decent, too many fatal flaws","This has been my only phone for the past 5 months so I feel I have a good handle on it at this point. I really really really want to love this phone, huge nokia fanboy, but a few things are stopping that from happening. I rarely write reviews, so go easy. ______________________________________________________________________________________ The good: 1) It works fine as a phone, I get the same service as my iphone, maybe even better in a few places. 2) battery life is excellent. I charge it about 2x a week. 3) small, light, dropping it multiple times has not resulted in anything bad. 4) the MP3 player works fine. The bad: 1) No group texting! Seriously. I can send a text to multiple people (but to the receiver it only shows me on the text, not everyone that i texted), but when im on a group text and someone texts me within that group text chain, the message is a lot of times completely blank. So, you can see that you have a text, and who its from, but the message is blank. In this day and age of so many group texts, this means Im simply missing out on a lot of texts from others. My nokia candybar phone from 8 years ago had group texts. WTF Nokia. 2) When texting and it does not know a word in T9, you can add a word (like the name of my daughter), which is suppose to save it in the memory so next time it remembers that word. Well, it doesn't work like that. It may remember the word for a day or two, but eventually it forgets it and you have to add it again and again and again. I honestly don't mind T9 texting, but this is frustrating. Again, my nokia candybar phone from nearly a decade ago was able to remember words when you added them to the phone memory. 3) Nokia support is truly non-exsistant. Im fairly tech savy but trying to figure out things that should be fairly simply is like cracking a secret code that requires going to 12 different websites or forums. For example, good luck transferring your contacts from an iphone to this nokia. Oh, its possible, but not in any way that is explained by nokia. Here, ill save you a lot of time https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/1479/nokia-3310-3g-usa-version-transferring-contacts 4) the phone memory fills up very fast, so you are constantly deleting text messages because for some reason the text messages cannot be stored on the SD card. 5) the internet is pretty much a joke on this thing. Fun to play around with once and have a good laugh, but thats it. All the ""apps"" on the phone just a hyperlink on the intenet, so not an app at all. Honestly, get rid of the internet nokia, people are not buying this thing for the internet. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Who is this phone for? I honestly don't know. My dad asked if he should get it for my mom who is old and has zero tech skills and just wants to call and receive calls. I told him no, this phone is much less intuitive, and way more complicated than old nokias, she would struggle too much, not to mention the tiny buttons. SO this phone is not for old people. THis phone is not for hipsters either. the internet sucks, and no group texting to share the crappy hipster photos the camera takes. Maybe the best user of this phone is someone who is pretty tech savy, likes to almost exclusively talk on the phone, and maybe only texts 5x total in a month. This phone would be good for that. Conclusion: Its sad that the nokia candybar phones i had from nearly a decade ago had MORE function than one released in 2017. I would love this phone with only a few minor changes: Give me group texting. Give me the ability to add words to T9 permanently, and give me the ability to add my texts to SD card so I don't have to constantly delete old ones to free up more space. A simple ""notes"" section would be nice somewhere too to, but now im just getting gready! SO basically, give me my EXACT nokia candybar phone from 2008 with modern 4g coverage on a GSM network that is compatible with current cell phone towers (tmobile) and I will be a happy camper.

20524,B07HD3QC65,N.G.,1,26-Aug-19,True,Fragile Faulty Charging Port - can't use it if you can't charge it.,"I wanted to like this phone. I came from a Samsung S7 and overall I was pleased with the Nokia 7.1 and the features for the price until the charging port went bust 8 months after purchase. It became very loose and wouldn't connect to the cable properly. I took my phone to a repair shop because I didn't want to send it overseas and upon researching the port issue I read a lot about Nokia service being hit or miss, mostly miss. The repair person told me that Nokia uses weak tape to attach their charging ports and they are attached in a bad location. He soldered the port on. Cost me about $100. I also found out that the Nokia port has less pins than other phones and because one of my pins was broken (which probably happened when trying to charge the phone in various positions) data transfer and charging will be very slow. A new port would have been an additional $200 for just the part, because apparently these aren't easy ports to fined. That entire cost would have been more than the cost of the phone so I opted to spend the money for only the soldering. I hated to spend even $100 but a new phone isn't in the budget right now. Hopefully the port will stay secure long enough until I can get a newer Samsung.

2368,B00CQAODG4,wmy76ram,5,26-Aug-13,False,Better than Droid RAZR Maxx HD and all the Other Leading Phones,"I'm writing this to first say this phone is the best yet and to dispel a couple of wrong comments I have read in other reviews. A little background... My last experience with a windows phone was an HTC running Win 5.XX. Not so good but I really liked the idea of easy sync with my computer. Since then I have had about 6 phones...blackberry, I-Phone, and android with my most recent the Droid RAZR MAXX HD. The Blackberry's were great but started falling behind. The Androids are fun but a little buggy, and the I-Phone and I just are not compatible. Then along came the Nokia 928 to Verizon, I love it. It is not as playful and gadget filled as others but it just plain works effectively and trouble free. It is not as ""Powerful"" as some, but it does not need the same amount of processing power because the operating system is much more efficient than Android. This 928 is every bit as fast as the MAXX HD, I-Phone, S3 and S4 The battery specs also do not match some others, but I am just going to say the battery life is just as good as what I experienced on my Droid RAZR Maxx HD, my son's S4 and the I-Phone. The sound quality on calls is every bit as good and the external speaker for music and speaker phone is definitely better. I read in one review that the NFC does not work with Android devices. This is simply not true. Maybe it does not work with all, but I know for a fact it works with my wife's S3 and my Son's S4. We have traded pictures, videos and other data with NFC. I read in another review that the pictures are not very good or have a red tint. This has not been my experience. The quality is definitely not as good as our fancy DSLR but it is as good as our small point and shoot digital. Video is also very good for a phone. The call quality and reception seems to be the best of all the phones I have owned. Even with a large multi-layer protective cover and skinomi skin. And now the ""lack of Apps."" I am not one who likes to use my phone as a level or as entertainment for my 5 year old. I use my phone for communication, keeping my schedule, music, and tracking my rides and hikes. Guess I also use it for maps and travel...I do use it for a lot of things and I have found all the apps I need...for free. And I must admit my five year old has been playing games. So In summary, this phone is better than any android, blackberry, and i-phone I have ever used. In the month and half I have had this phone there has been no freezes and the touch screen is great. Its not ass powerful or feature rich as some, but t does not need to be...it is more efficient..and better in my opinion.

I dropped it twice before I bought a skin/cell case for it without any problems or even scratches. My 1 & 1/2 year old son placed the phone in the microwave for about 10 seconds before I caught him & the only problem I ended up with was a temporary frozen screen. After turning the phone back on, I haven't had that problem any more. Plus my son is not allowed near it now. The screen is large & very clear even in direct sunlight. I like the square shape of it & the numerous color choices to change the theme/tile colors. When I get bored of one color, I quickly switch to another. The camera is of course excellent in both day & night time shots, but the video capture is even better. I have a Sony hand-held video camera that in bright sunlight keeps trying to refocus the lens & half the video comes out blurry. The video on this phone is crystal clear, very bright with vivid colors. My only 2 complaints: 1. I wish there was a ""forward"" button, not just a ""go back"" one. This would make navigation even easier. 2. And my biggest disappointment is that I can't add strings to phone numbers. With my old ancient phone, I could check my bank account balance by phone by entering the phone #, then ""pause"", ""pause"" and then the the account number.

It also has an FM radio tuner that works when earbuds/headphones are plugged in to the 1/8"" jack. The battery life is alright, not great.

It's built sturdy and sleek and has fantastic battery life - much better than any of my previous Android phones. The screen has beautiful color and clarity and the camera is amazing. I've seen others complain about the screen cracking easily but in my experience (and I'm pretty rough on my phones - 3 kids), this phone is a trooper. I've actually accidentally dropped my phone down the metal staircase in the back of my apartment without a case - from the second floor, more than once - and the screen sustained zero damage. There are so many options within this phone that you have to go through all of them to get the full experience of what this phone is capable of. It is fully synced up with my Windows 8 laptop and everything is automatically shared between the two which is extremely helpful to me. My favorite part is the internet sharing capability - depending on your data plan - you can share your data network with any other device.

You have to be looking at it and there must be light, because you need to be able to see the buttons on the side. It doesn't help that the buttons are the exact shade of black as the rest of the phone. I wish the buttons were white. Also the buttons are poorly placed so that you almost can't help but to press one just by holding the phone. Also, the phone is hard to hang onto. It's like a bar of soap.

Here are the reasons why: 1. Its a smart phone and comparable with any smartphone out in the market. Not just in the price range of $100 but with those sold for $200-300. The windows app store is not right there with apple or android app store but it offers most of the commonly used apps such as Pandora, you tube, whats app, wechat, Facebook, Google maps, etc. 2. Nice and smooth browsing experience. Its just $70 and it makes you feel like you have a high end phone. 3. The Nokia apps for GPS and music are freaking awesome. Music browsing features and associated options are very user-friendly. Nokia music app lets the user to create his own music mixes while also letting the user to download up to four mixes which can be used offline. Isn't it awesome, huh? 4. Storage: This phone comes with 8 GB on-board storage capacity, which is good for storing as many apps that a regular person could use. Moreover, it supports micro SD cards up to 64 GB, which is humongous to store loads of music. 5. The only thing i would have preferred to have is a high capacity battery. This phone is equipped with a 1430 mAh battery which could last no more than one day. I wish it had a higher capacity battery, and wouldn't have regretted paying $15-20 for that. But, given the price, battery is good too. Verdict: 4.5/5, and the deduction of 0.5 is for the lack of satisfactory battery life. Overall, i really like the phone.

3649,B00HWEMZ1E,Brian Campagna,4,25-Jun-14,True,Excellent Windows Phone Device,"I bought the Nokia Lumia Icon because I needed new service and was worn out by the persistent fragmentation in the Android Ecosystem. So far I have been impressed by this phone. It has an excellent camera, great 1080x1920 display at over 440 PPI and a speedy processor. Unfortunately it doesn't have expandable storage, but with the increasing prevalence of services like Pandora and Spotify, as well as the OneDrive integration the 32GB built in memory is sufficient. Once the phone receives its Windows Phone 8.1 update it should be even better. The only major downfall is the ecosystem. The Windows Phone ecosystem still lags behind the Google Play Store as well as Apple's App Store. There are still apps for most needs but they may not be the same quality. If you are someone who already is invested in the iOS or Android ecosystems, or if you need specific apps, then I cannot recommend the Nokia Lumia Icon. For everyone else it certainly is a high quality phone and it may be worth it to switch to Windows Phone 8.

2383,B00CQAODG4,Brian A. Wolters,5,25-Jun-13,False,An Amazing Alternative To iPhone and Android,"I won't lie, I am a Microsoft fan. From Windows 3.1 to Windows 8, I've used and enjoyed their operating systems over the years. When Pocket PC came out, I snatched it up in the form of a Dell Axim and eventually joined it together with my phone in the form of Windows Mobile. Windows Mobile, quite frankly, had issues. It was quite prone to lockups and awkward user experiences. Despite the fact it was quite customizable with ROM's and had good support for a while, when iPhone and eventually Android came around, it was outdated. So I kept my eye on the upcoming Windows Phone 7. And while I liked what I saw, I decided to go with Android and enjoyed the Android experience for a good while. I also had a worked issued iPhone5 but I just never cared for the iPhone's interface and having ""every app"" wasn't an issue for me. Enter Windows Phone 8. Just a few days with it and I am SOLD! Where to start? First up, I love the hubs! Once you are used to how the hubs work, it makes perfect sense. All of your games are in the Games hub, which is heavily XBOX connected and themed. Photos Hub not only shows you photos and videos on your phone but also from SkyDrive and Facebook. In addition, you can slide over and see any photo updates on your preferred social networks and also see any camera/photo related app. Hubs rock! I am already a big fan of Family Rooms. Create a family room and anyone with a Windows Phone can join and then the fun begins. You can share pictures, have group text messages, share OneNote's and keep things like grocery lists in sync. You can have shared calendars as well. The only thing missing are shared TASKS. You can also create multiple Family Rooms. Very nice option. The start screen and live tiles are a joy to use and while not as robust as Android, you can come up with a lot of customizations. You have three sized of tiles that you can use. Small for easy to group apps and ones you don't need live files for. The mid-size for standard functional live tiles and a third that will show the full, rectangular live tile. I use the largest for Facebook, Photos and a few other apps that I like to have the largest live tile for. Apps. Yeah, to win people over from the app heavy iPhone or Android, you've got to have apps. I once saw someone who couldn't wait to get this phone but because there was no OFFICIAL Instagram, they went to iPhone5. That said, if you don't have to have every app or official apps, you will be happy. I cannot name one app that I really miss from Android. If there isn't an app for it, the excellent Internet Explorer 10 browser works just fine. If I have to give it one negative, and it is a BIG negative, it would be media, namely music. I was a Zune fan and owned both the original and ZuneHD. While not perfect, the Zune Software was really good and I still use it often to listen to music (and sync my Zune.) I know cloud based services are the coming thing but with the big cellular providers limiting data these days, it makes little sense that there isn't an easy way to sync music. I have an XBOX Music Pass (9.99 a month for unlimited music streaming/downloads) and while it comes in handy for a quick find and listen to a streaming album (or even a direct download to the phone), there is no easy way to manage playlists. I actually have to use Windows Media Player and then download the Windows Phone DESKTOP app to sync music directly to my phone. And even then, album art is spotty (there is a great app to fix the album art problem) and music rights verification problems come up. So, if you decide to stream your XBOX Music, it is a hit and (mostly) miss experience. Album art has even more problems when playing music in the cloud and cloud based music has a hiccup on every song when there is 5 seconds left in the song. In addition, managing your cloud music is a mess. Not that Google Music was great but it was far better than this at cloud music management. Suffice to say, XBOX Music needs a lot of work, especially if you are going to win iTunes users. The phone itself is very snappy and I've had no issues with it. The camera is everything they say and it is quite amazing. I don't feel upset if I leave my SLR camera at home. As a power user, I thought I'd miss the direct file level access I had with Android. So far, I haven't. I am a heavy SkyDrive user and it comes in handy. I have to say I am now a Windows Phone fan and I don't see myself leaving it anytime soon. I don't care for the iPhone user interface and between lockups and horrible OS upgrade options with Android, I don't see myself going back to Android. If you are willing to leave the mainstream and take a chance on a phone that gives you an amazing experience, you can 't go wrong with Windows Phone and the Nokia Lumia 928.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0
1760,B00A2V7ULY,Sami,5,25-Jun-13,True,"Beautiful, smooth, high quality, the best smart phone out there","Nokia has always had the best sound and signal quality. Unfortunately, people in the US don't know Nokia well. In my opinion, a smartphone should be a good ""phone"" first and that's what Iphone and Galaxy are NOT. Their sound quality litterally sucks. If you are in a very noisy area, your Iphone or your Galaxy are useless. You should leave the place and go to a more quite place. Nokia has sophisticated noise reduction algorithms and gives you a very clear sound qulity in every environment. If you haven't had a high quality phone before you won't realize what you are missing. Exactly like driving a Luxary car comparing to a Kia. If you have never used a good car, you will be okay with your Kia or Ford. Their noise doesn't bother you. their poor suspension system doesn't bother you, their uncomfortable seat doesn't bother you. However, if you drive a good car for a while you know how bad those cars are. My wife bought an Iphone and returned it in two weeks and I totally agreed with her that the sound quality of the Iphone was horrible. It doesn't end there. This phone has the best quality camera, its display is amazing. The Microsoft live tile is very creative idea. The user interface is simply the best. It's beautiful and smooth. In fact iOS 7 is copying lots of things from Windows Phone. Apple always said they would never make a phone with bigger screens however, their next Iphone will have a 5"" display. Put a Nokia Lumia 920 next to an Iphone and you will see how outdated the Iphone looks. All these things mean that Apple is so behind the technology/design now. As of applications, there hasn't been anything that we missed in Windows Phone store.

2358,B00CQAODG4,Soner Bicici,5,25-Jul-13,False,Thinking about buying Lumia 928? Let's see if I can convince you,"Background: In the past three years, I have used iPhone 4, 4S and 5. I also used Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S3. Let me tell you from the start that I am not a loyal customer of any brand. I will give my business to any company as long as they give me the best value possible. Hopefully, this background information will be useful to you since if we are coming from different backgrounds, this review maybe useless to you. First of all, I am not a heavy user. When I had Android phones, I didn't install custom roms or anything like that due to security concerns. I also didn't jailbreak my iPhones for the same reason. I don't install tons of apps or play many games on my phones. Just to give you an idea, I probably had less than 100 apps in my iPhone and much less than that on S3 since the apps that I would want to download on Android platform would require me to accept their unreasonable terms where apps would want to access my contacts, full network access, phone storage, messages and such for no apparent reason. I log into banks and etc on my phones, there is no way I am giving those kind of permissions to apps! As a result, I am not a fan of Android. Also, I had a lot of issues with both of my Android phones. Even the Samsung Galaxy S3 had lagging, freezing and rebooting issues after only 2 weeks of usage. Plus, the build quality of the S3 left a lot to be desired. So, I sold it after owning it for less than a month and purchased an iPhone 4S. My experience with IOS was much better. I initially didn't have any lagging, freezing or rebooting issues at all. What they advertised was true, it just worked. It was somewhat boring and had a small screen compared to competitors but it was safer and it worked great. However, after the iPhone 5 launch my 4S started having performance issues following the OS updates. I am pretty sure that Apple did this on purpose to make their customers upgrade to the newest iPhone. They succeeded as well. I upgraded to iPhone 5 only to regret it later. It is light, fast and has 4g lte but other than that I felt it was the same phone as the 4S. Sorry for taking so long to talk about the product that I am actually writing a review for but whenever I read reviews, I enjoy the ones that make comparisons. I find those reviews the most helpful, so I tried to do the same thing in my review. Now that's out of the way, let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928. I will break this review down to pros and cons to make reading easier. Here are the pros: - Camera: It takes great pictures. Especially, the low light pictures are very good. IMO, Lumia 92x series have the best camera in the market except for the Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808. - Skydrive: It's similar to iCloud. You can upload your documents, pictures etc to skydrive. This phone will automatically backup your applist, settings, text messages and photos to skydrive. However, you can go to Settings -> Backup and turn backup off if you want to. I turned the automatic back up for the pictures off because when I take a picture that I don't like, I have to delete it from the camera roll as well as the skydrive. I thought I would rather upload the ones that I really like than delete the ones that I don't like from both locations every single time. - Battery Life: This phone has great battery life. However, you have to do a few adjustments to get the full potential. Do yourself a favor and search online for Windows Phone 8 battery tips and you'll see a list of adjustments you can make to improve your battery life. I just got this phone a week ago but I've already gotten 2 days out of it with moderate usage after I've made the adjustments. If you need any help, just add a comment and I'll try to help you out if I can. - Ability to uninstall bloat ware without hacking the device!. Not that it comes with many bloat ware but for example I uninstalled the Verizon navigation without any issues. Its very simple, tap and hold the app and click uninstall. Easy! - Performance: Exceptional. Very fluid, lag free. - Build Quality: Very good. Go to a Verizon store and check this phone out, you'll see what I am talking about. My only problem is the soft keys (Windows, back and search buttons have a yellowish color when lit which is not normal) When I searched online, it seems that a lot of people have the same issue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But if it's something that would bother you, just make sure the phone that you purchase doesn't have that issue in the store before you take it home. - Wireless charging: I think it's a nice feature. I welcome any type of real innovation. I believe these type of innovations are not only important for what they actually do currently but also they push competitors to come up with other innovations as well to stay competitive. In my opinion, this creates a better value for customers. - Screen: Looks great. Very nice colors. You can view the screen in direct sun light with no problems. It won't be the same as viewing it at night but it is much better than iPhones and Android devices that I've used/seen. - Speakers: Pretty good. Not on par with HTC One's speakers but definitely better than most. - Nokia exclusive apps: Nokia maps is great. It will give you voice guided navigation with street names. I tested it out once and it worked out great. The biggest plus for Nokia maps is the fact that you don't need data connection. Just download your regions map and you are set. Additionally, maybe due to the phone not having to use data to get map information, it ran much cooler than my previous iPhones and Android devices while using the navigation app which is a big plus. - Value: You are getting a great device, a fluid and stable OS, 32gbs of standard storage and a great camera for only $30 with a 2 year contract at Amazon or $450 without signing a contract. This is a great value. I seriously don't know if there are any better deals out there. I am very happy with my decision to buy this phone. I think you'll feel the same way too. Now time for the Cons: - As I mentioned before, even though this phone has great build quality, the yellowish buttons puts a dent on its greatness. - No sd card slot. I appreciate that this phone comes with standard 32gb of storage space. I also appreciate that we get skydrive for no additional cost but I would have still liked if we had the micro sd card lost so I could pop in a 64gb micro sd card and have 96gb of storage. - Notification bar. It's not a big deal and I understand that live tiles are the notification bar of Windows Phone 8 but I think it wouldn't have hurt having both. There are rumors that the upcoming update will give us a notification bar but nothing for sure yet. Not having it doesn't bother me much but I would welcome it if they added it. - Closing apps: I haven't seen anyone mention this and maybe it's something that I am doing wrong but when you have open apps in WP8, you have to close them by pressing the back button. However, if you for example open the internet explorer to browse the internet and you visit a few different links, you will have to press the back button multiple times to be able to close the app. I find that annoying. Also, to close the apps that are running in the background, you have to press and hold the back button which lets you view all the open apps in the background. However there is no ""x"" button on the right upper corners (just like iPhones do) to be able to close the apps easily. I have to open each app and press the back button to actually close that app. I think it's a big flaw and they need to address this in their next update. Again, I only had this phone for a week so maybe there is a very intuitive way of closing apps that I am not aware of but AFAIK, that is what you need to do to close apps. - Apps: As I mentioned earlier, I am not a heavy app user so I really don't miss any apps from the IOS. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people may have certain apps that they use and are not willing to give them up to move to WP8. So, make a list of your most used apps and see if WP8 has them or not. Conclusion: I really like this device. The more I use it, the more I like it and the less I miss the IOS. I would highly recommend that you give this phone a try. If you have any questions, feel free to leave comments and I will try my best to answer your questions.",11.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

Here is the truth, I don’t need my smartphone. Yes, I said that. After months of frustration over my smartphone not performing to doing the things that I wanted it to do, and having an unhealthy attachment to my smartphone, I started to ask myself, “do I really need it”? There were things for work that I certainly needed, but I have WiFi at the office and a tablet. I can work around this. What can I do though? Here comes the Nokia 3310. I had the classic Nokia 3310 back in the early 2000’s, when all that was available was this for a cell phone and loved it. For $55 dollars, there was really no reason to not try it out, in the name of science if nothing else. What I have found in the 3 days I have had the Nokia 3310 is, I don’t need a smartphone! With the combination of my tablet in WiFi, I am able to work through all of the things I needed a smartphone for my job. What the Nokia 3310 has forced me to do is make more phone calls, which I should be doing anyway, and being more attentive to the people around me. The biggest challenge that I have found so far is texting and navigation. The texting piece is as above; I need to make more phone calls anyway. For navigation, that just tells me I need to know the lay of the land better. Forward thinking, I can download a map into Google Maps on my tablet and have the ability to navigate offline. If there is an emergency where I need navigation, I guess I can make a phone call. This is not a smartphone! It’s frustrating to see someone compare this to an Android or iPhone. That’s like comparing balloons to tissue paper; they are not even close.

15478,B075FLG6MV,Metal_Chips_85,5,25-Jan-18,True,Hail the creator!,"Before i took the plastic wrap off or even turned it on, i was very impressed by the weight and feel of the Nokia 2. Weighing in at 162 grams, she's got some Gravity in her! It feels good. I bought this phone because; I have owned two Windows Nokia Lumia's. before, and both were excellent! (The Nokia 2 being no exception =D) The advertised battery capacity. A ""Pure"" android operating system. Nokia delivered just that and more! The build quality and feel is beautiful. I bought a white model, and the two tone black metal bezel to the white body is very smooth. The screen, for a 720x1280 res @ 296 Display PPI, looks very good. Nokia states that this is an energy efficient screen. It looks good compared to a Samsung. The performance of the phone is slow. Not fast. Again, Nokia stated that this is an energy efficient CPU. I am a very demanding performance enthusiast! I like fast cars, and Fast computers! That said, i am not disappointed by the phones performance at all. It is a quality Snapdragon CPU, so i am sure it will churn through many tasks very steadily. Using this as a daily driver, along with a more powerful tablet, might be a good strategy to consider for power users. Just saying. I am writing this review about 24 hours after the unboxing, and it is above half battery life since initial charge. And i leaned on the camera and downloaded, installed and configured almost 100 apps. I will be pushing this phone. It accepted a 128gb micro sd card. So, mem is not an issue with the initial 8gb and the Clean and Bloatware Free Android Os allows you to control where you store what. Device could very easily be bootloader unlocked and flashed, if that's your thing. I might try Lineage os at some time, but i see no reason as this is one of the cleanest Android OS's i've ridden so far. Camera doesn't seem to be on par with previous Nokia's with the Carl Zeiss Tessar lens. No problem, its still a great value. And i have yet to get a feel for it. TBD. . .

1483,B00A2V7BA4,Adam B,5,25-Jan-13,False,Updated Review 3/3/2013 - My Lumia 920 is running perfect now,"See the updates under my original review. Original review: The Lumia 920 is a great smartphone. The tiles can be resized and moved so it was easy to customize my start screen to suit my needs. I like getting updated information from the live tiles. I hope more apps are developed to take full advantage of the live tiles. I plan on getting one for my mother because her bad eyes can easily see the medium resized tiles on the OS. The camera takes very clear pictures most of the time and there are camera apps that add more functions to the camera like multishoot and panorama. There aren't a lot of camera settings but there are enough for most users. The wi-fi is able to pick up signals from most of my neighbors and our houses have a good bit of space between them. The wi-fi signal in my 920 is stronger than my desktop's wired connection. Speedtest shows my 920 getting 3 times the speed of my wired desktop connection at the same distance from the router. Having access to all my documents and mobile MS Office on my phone is very useful. I can just load my documents onto a skydrive and access them anywhere and on any of my devices. I have my skydrive loaded with my SNES games, school documents, and work documents. It's free but it's limited to 7GB total storage and files can't be above 2GB. The screen is large and displays images beautifully. I've watched a few movies on it and the large screen is a huge improvement over my other phones. The large screen also makes games easier to see and control. There are tons of apps in the app store. I spent hours looking at all the different apps. All the most useful apps were free and there were a lot of free games in the store too. My favorite app is the SNES emulator. I'm enjoying playing all my old super nintendo games again. I'm very happy with my purchase. 1/31/2013 - Update: Avoid Battery Apps I began having problems with my Lumia 920 freezing, overheating, and the battery draining a little faster than usual. After reading similar problems and solutions I was able to elminate those problems by uninstalling a battery app that I downloaded from the app store. Battery apps don't come preloaded on the phone. It's best to avoid them so they don't cause problems. 2/17/2013 - Update: Constant Crashing I'm having problems with my Lumia 920 again. It's constantly locking up and forcing me to reset it. There are many apps that can cause problems so I disabled all of them. I also disabled the built in automatic clock updates because it can cause the Lumia 920 to crash. After about 10 mintues of playing any game on the phone it crashes, even when background apps, bluetooth, and auto clock updates are all disabled. It also gets very hot. I've tried to play games with my protective case off to see if that was causing it to overheat and crash, that didn't help. I regret buying this phone now. I paid full price through Amazon Wireless so it was a very expensive mistake. The constant crashing is the only thing I don't like about the phone. If you don't play games or use apps then this phone would be a good choice. If you use apps and play games on your phone then you should avoid the Lumia 920. Consider a different model Lumia or a Windows phone from a different manufacturer. 3/3/2013 - Update: My Lumia 920 is running perfect now After uninstalling more apps and updating everything my Lumia 920 is finally running without crashing. I think my problems were fixed by the new HERE Drive, HERE City Lens, HERE Maps, and HERE Transit apps that replaced the old versions. I've been adding apps back onto the phone and I've been using it a lot more than usual for testing purposes and it's running smooth. Now I can recommend this phone to my friends and family. The freezing issue was the only flaw the Lumia 920 had, now it's flawless.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

3607,B00HWEMZ1E,Amazon Customer,5,25-Feb-15,False,"Buy it, have reasonable expectations, and you mght just love it.","Upgraded to this phone from a Lumia 928, and glad I did. I had an iPhone for a while as well as an Android. While many have pointed out that this doesn't have as many apps as the other two OS's, that really doesn't bother me too much. The preloaded apps are great and all connect to the general Microsoft ecosystem. With my Microsoft account I can access MSN News, Finance, Health and Fitness, and so on, and have live updates delivered straight to my home screen. The downside of Live Tiles is that they are not as functional as widgets; e.g. you cannot have music controls on your home screen. Instead, you have to open the application or use the built in music controls (by pressing a volume button to bring it up). That being said, the live tiles blow iOS out of the water, since all live updates on iOS (that I know of) are delivered by the drop-down notifications bar, which is severely limited in its options. Thanks to more recent updates the background of all tiles on my home screen is customizable, escaping from the classic ""choose your color and deal with it"". In addition, app folders allow for many more apps to be stored in a smaller amount of space. the customizability of tile sizes is a huge advantage over iOS, since it allows me to more easily access the apps I use the most, such as messaging and internet. Even Android is lmited in that aspect, since widgets are not available for every app, and as far as I know the only option for increasing home screen area. The Music application, while sometimes slow to load, is comparable with that found on Android, in that its very highly editable, its alot easier to create a playlist and add songs to it on a windows phone or an android than an iPhone. It also syncs up with Windows 8 computers and tablets, similar to Spotify, so my music is accessible anywhere. With an Xbox Music Pass (similar to the premium version of Spotify) I can add music to my phone and cloud collection for no cost, and no ads. Both cameras are great. The rear 20 MP is very solid for taking pictures outside, but in low light interior conditions its slightly worse than the Galaxy S5 (from my own testing). If the lighting is good. it takes some of the highest quality pictures I've seen on a phone. Meanwhile, while I'm not a big selfie fan, the front facing camera has great color and performs well even in low lighting. The battery life on this phone is simply amazing. Any time I spend time with my friends, they are often reaching for a charger because their battery life runs out by the end of the day. I hardly ever have that problem. And while the battery isn't replaceable, I've found that these Lumia phones (my moms 825 and my old 928) take a very long time before the battery life starts degrading, Most Lumias also have the option of wireless charging (built into this one) which removes the classic problem of having to plug and unplug every single time you use the phone at night. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, but its something you DEFINITELY NOTICE once you have had wireless charging for a while. I bought this phone used or refurbished on Ebay for $225. It was well worth every penny. If you can get over not having every app (and the windows app store has replacements for most) then this is a great purchase to make. Summary: Pros: -Great cameras -Highly customizable Home Screen with Live Tiles -Integrates nicely with all Windows products, especially Windows 8 computers/ tablets -Great preloaded applications including Music, Internet Explorer, MSN Finance, Health and Fitness, etc -Unbeatable battery life with built in wireless charging -Reasonable price Cons: -Won't have all the apps you want, you might have to settle for 3rd party replacements -Less popular ecosystem, so it doesn't go along with your friends phones as well Just like any phone, you're going to have compromises when you purchase this one. If you keep that in mind, and appreciate the things that make a Windows phone unique, then you will learn to love this phone and operating system.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

Initially I was not sure about this phone, but after some research about its features/platform and reading some good number of reviews, I decided to go with this. It has been a close to a month now and the phone never disappointed me speed/functionality-wise. Features that stood out for me (when compared to iPhone) - Nokia Drive: Built in GPS & works offline - Great!!! - Nokia Maps - Just great!!..Very much comparable to Google Maps - Office app - Word, XL & powerpoint = - 8 MP camera: This phone has a great camera, specially the lenses that you could use: Panaroma, Night mode, sports mode and group mode. I have used all these lensed and the photos came out just great. - Windows 8 - The platform is refreshing. I only selected the apps that I want and posted them on the home screen. (There are some few apps such as Chrome & Vonage) that I had in my iPhone, but these are not show stoppers- IE10 on the phone works great too. I found all the apps such as Youtube, FB, email, Netflix, Amazon, all bank apps, news related apps etc..that I needed on Windows 8.(and I see more apps being added each day...but I doubt if I will ever need them) The only shortcoming is the battery - The phone need to be charged daily even with less use. The phone just sucks the power out. Not a big deal if you carry a charging cable and also have a car charger.

I can't keep my hands off this thing. Pros: Top of the line in specs. Processor power is amazing, it even beats the Galaxy S5. Camera is fantastic. Crystal clear pictures, with a dozen Nokia exclusive photo editing apps to play around with your photos. Great size. Can perfectly fit in one hand, and your thumb can reach every point on the screen. Windows interface is amazing. Blazing fast, ZERO delay. Responds impressively fast. And much much more pros...just dont have the time to write it.. Cons: No micro-sd memory card slot. Probably the biggest problem. Much less apps on the Windows App Store as compared to IOS or Android.

15438,B075FL4H89,RobertoC_73,3,25-Apr-18,True,"Okay, but not worthy of Nokia 3310 branding","I received the phone quickly and in good condition. The phone is okay for someone with reasonable expectations from a feature phone, but the model name was just marketing playing on people's nostalgia. The original 3310 was pretty much indestructible, yet this one feels like it will break if you drop it... and you can easily drop it because its material is very slippery! The UX is okay for what it is. While it is a bit of a throwback to older Nokia Series-40 UI, it's not a throwback to the 3310 but to later phones like the 3100. I was kind of disappointed that, other than the Nokia Tune, there were no remakes of classic Nokia ringtones from the original 3310 days. The feature to import contacts from an Android phone makes a huge mess, running first and last names together, and creating multiple contact entries for single contacts with multiple numbers. Depending on how many contacts you need to import to the phone, it may be best for you to enter them manually provided you can still type on a T9 phone keypad. Speaking of keypads, this 3310 has a decent 12-key phone keypad, but the buttons that hold the Call/End keys together with UI softkeys are a bit on the mushy side, and the directional pad will irritate everybody except little kids; it isn't good for big and/or long fingers. Picture quality of the camera is mediocre, but I wasn't expecting much from a 2-megapixel camera. One thing it does well is taking selfies. I didn't have to pose in front of a mirror and got a few selfies, all framed properly on the first try. Shutter speed is extremely slow! When you press the button to take the photo and hear the shutter sound, you still need to hold the phone steady for over one extra second, if you expect to get a usable photo. People are knocking down the Snake game because it isn't true to the original, but as someone who had a phone from the original 3310 series, it didn't have the original Snake game either, it had Snake 2 which is what the modern 3310's Snake game reminds me of. I would rather take off review points for all the other bloatware and game demos you cannot uninstall. As a feature phone with (InsertRandomNameHere), I would've given it four stars but as a phone that dares to carry the legacy of the Nokia 3310 brand, this one falls short.",4.0,Nokia,Nokia 3310 3G - Unlocked Single SIM Feature Phone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 2.4 Inch Screen - Charcoal,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3310-3G-Unlocked-T-Mobile/dp/B075FL4H89,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iQ4QgMchL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FL4H89,497,54.99,59.0

Only a blank line shows up unless you delete all prior messages from the contact. When you reply to a group mms, only one person gets it back. Camera quality is horrible and I never use it. Changing volume to silent and back to loud is frustrating. You unlock and then hold the star button to access volume. Should be quicker than this. Flashlight randomly turns on in pocket and I find a bright dot through my pant pocket.

Durable and well-designed is NOT how I would describe this phone. Because it has a flat screen and doesn't fold, the buttons and screen are always exposed. There is no way to turn off the screen unless you turn the phone off. This results in the buttons constantly being pressed and making loud noises every second of the day in my backpack or my pocket. I truly hate this phone. Apparently it has dialed actual phone numbers too, which is surprising it would do that accidentally. Nonetheless, it's the most annoying irritating phone I've ever had, and that's saying a lot since I tolerated smartphones for a year and a half. It's extremely cheap, I threw it on the ground just to get it to shut up for once and the back with the battery came off.

2292,B00CQAODG4,Kindle Customer,1,24-Nov-14,False,should have stayed with droid...,I've had this phone for six months now. The first one I actually had to return because the speaker was all crinkly. This one was okay for the first 14 days. But I quickly ran into issues. The phone shuts off by itself. It sometimes freezes up and I have to shut it down. It takes decent pictures but you can't zoom at all. Sometimes I'll suddenly lose data and not be able to use the internet unless I restart. And other times the phone basically has a seizure. I lose total control of the phone while it switches from app to app and even tries to call people. The only thing that I can do to stop this is shutting the phone down. On the plus side...

I heard great reviews about the Nokia Lumia 920 but I'll break it down in a nutshell. Pros: 1. Camera is great 2. The yellow on the phone is beautiful 3. Smooth to the touch on the screen 4. The screen is nice, clear and big 5. The sound is clear and loud 6. I fell and dropped on my phone and it didn't crack. But get a case still. 7. Options to customize your phone is fun. Cons: 1. The apps are very limited and some of them hardly worked 2. Using Google or Bing was a pain. You can't even find the images options there. 3. Closing apps are just as difficult. Not like the iPhone when you can just swipe it up. 4. A lot of the notifications are just unbelievably slow. You'll get notified from Facebook probably the next day. 5. If you're an iPhone user, you'll probably get frustrated with complex of the phone. 6. This phone is not as user friendly as the iPhone. 7. You can't put any of the apps in folders.

It is attractive beyond belief, easy to use, has a much larger app base than some would have you believe, is very durable (google drop tests), and has the most fluid interface of all the platforms out there. The camera is superb and the battery life is amazing. At first I though the battery sucked but that is because you have to turn on the battery saver mode in settings and turn of NFC function when you are not using it. After doing that this phone easily lasts 24 hours with very regular use. The sound quality in calls and on speaker is the best I have ever seen and the pre-installed apps such as Nokia Drive, Maps, Microsoft Office, and One Note are fantastic. All apps work amazing, never any glitching that I have seen and that goes for all Windows phones (Microsoft is very particular about their app development).

2266,B00CQAODG4,Geebox,5,24-May-13,False,Great Phone for the Price,"A User Review on the Nokia Lumia 928. Got my Nokia 928 a few days ago. First, overall the phone is GREAT and I would recommend it to anyone. IMO it is the Best Windows Phone to date. I will also say that in comparison to the other Operating System's; Android and iOS, Windows Phone 8 OS is better and faster in my opinion. Of course that is Subjective. Everyone has his or her preference as to the features, apps, size, style, color and specs of a phone that work for them and that's just fine. My sister likes the iphone 5 and it works just fine for here. My younger brother likes Android ICS and it works fine for him. The point is, I nor anyone else has to convince each person that they should buy a particular Phone. Having said that this is just a review for anyone not sure of Windows Phone 8. The Pros and the Cons. Pros: 1. The Operating System: The Windows Phone 8 OS is smooth fast and responsive. It runs faster on a lower processor than a newer Android's faster quad processor. The point is, it doesn't have to have 4 or more processors to run smoother and faster. Though I have not had it longer the 8 days as of this review I nor the persons I know who have a WP8, have not experienced the lags, bugs and many reboots I have had with Android Phones and Tablets. I didn't like the Windows Tiles when I first heard or seen them in pictures, but expect for the plain colors (you eventually get use to them) they work great. The Live Tiles update you on all the info you need on one screen without having to click on a bunch of different apps Mail, Facebook, Weather, Agenda, Calender, Messaging are all updated right on the front screen. You can customize the look, size, color of your Tiles and change them with ease. 2. The Camera: This has to be one of the best cameras on a Phone. You will not be disappoint on the pictures it takes in daylight or low light. Nokia is hyping up this Camera and I have to agree. The Camera alone is a good reason to get this phone. 3. Call Quality is good: Both calling and receiving. The speaker on it is loud and clear. 4. The Display is great with the AMOLED Display. It makes the screen sharp and clear and great even it sunlight. The Size at 4.5 inches is also a nice size, not too big and not too small. 5. Xenon Flash: Brighter and better Flash as found on some standalone cameras. 6. HD 1080p recording with great noise canceling mics. Also has front Facing 1.2MP camera. 7. 32 GB internal storage 8. 4G Network: I haven't had the chance to fully test it yet, but my pages load super-fast and my downloads are fast as well. 9. Battery: Battery usage for a smartphone is Good. It also has wireless charging. 10. APPS: There is a lot of criticism with this OS and lack of apps. This area is where people have to put things in the right prospective. Yes iOS and Android has more Apps than WP8. I have to laugh a little when this argument is brought up. First who downloads that many apps? Second putting thing in the right prospective, iOS and Android is 5years old. Developers have had plenty of time to make apps. Windows Phone is going on 3years old with Window Phone 8 being only 6 months old with over 145,000 to date. Most of the top apps or equivalent is available right now on the WP store, with more being added as the months go buy. The point is, it took both Android and Apple years to get to the app count they have now. Besides most of the apps on those system or useless apps that don't say on a phone for long yet alone even make it to ones phone. Again my point is most of the main or equivalent apps that people use are either on the store or in development. If Windows Phone 8 sells great(and I think it will) more apps will come faster. Anyway Nokia has a set of apps that make this phone stand out itself, Nokia Music, Nokia City Lens: Nokia Maps, Nokia Drive. There are plenty of other apps that make this a great pick. Cons: 1. No External Storage. I think Nokia made a mistake here. Even though it has an internal 32 gig storage( 23G usable) they should have made room for external storage. I like having my music, videos and some data on a storage card so I am not tied to a computer or downloading data on a cell or wifi. I almost didn't get the phone because if this. 2. No removable battery. I am a heavy user, both personal and work. I like having a couple of charged batteries to throw in when I just can't charge. 3. Lack of Apps? I put this here because in comparison to the other two OS's, WP8 does have less apps, however I think I make a good point above as to why this is not a good reason to not buy this Phone. 4. No FM Radio: other Nokia Phones have the radio turned on. Though I heard that it can be turned on in a firmware update. 5. No Etiquette: My own personal preference; a feature that mutes the phone when you face it down. 6. Wish it had a stylus for notes: My own personal preference 7. No Swype Keyboard: My own personal preference 8. Unless I am wrong, No Video output to TV.

I still have few of the old Nokia Lumia era Qi- chargers around which are now back in service. Phone is really good looking though slippery without cover. So for ""show offerers"" you need to remove the cover to be able to ""show off"" the good looks of the phone. I got it $599, that's a good price for this workhorse. Camera is really good, the depth pics are truly remarkable and you can get cool pics out after re-focusing. The colors are very close to true and not over exposed or saturated like other top phones images on the market. If you like over exposed, sharpened and saturated colors you can make them look like that. But you can first enjoy almost DSLR quality images. Also the monochrome is really cool as it is real black and white photo. I'm not pro photographer but have been using DSLR for anything important, but with Nokia 9 I don't have to always drag the big bag with me and still can get great photos. The processing is not an issue as you can take as many pictures you want and the processing happens background. When you use DSLR You need to work with the pictures on your computer anyways. With Nokia 9 you can edit the pictures on the phone, even waiting the processing still much faster than DSLR and PC editing. You can share the edited (if needed) high quality pictures in a minute.

4918,B00O15MWOM,Moniker,3,24-Mar-15,False,Don't think of it as a phone with a camera / think of it as a camera with a crappy phone attached,"This phone has issues. It's hard to get the ringer and alerts to turn off. When you do get them turned off, they will turn back on unexpectedly. I notice this most when I'm at work because it drives me and those around me CRAZY. I'll turn the volume down to vibrate, but it rings anyway. When I get a text it is a horrible loud chime. I can't turn the chime off. I need to turn the phone off if I'm in meetings because it's embarrassing. The music player is XBox and it's alright, but kind of quirky. I leave it on random play but it seems to play the same songs, then will decide to stop playing songs. I don''t understand the player I guess. I'll usually hear the same 100 or so songs when it's set to random play which is weird cause I have thousands of songs saved to this phone. That's the nice thing about this phone, it has tons of space. The camera is pretty amazing. The video comes out wobbly but the pictures look great, especially when you use the onboard touch up effects. The recent OS update was a total flop: I work as a web developer and we have a mobile version of our site. Since the update, a lot of the functionality on our mobile site doesn't work on this phone. I alerted branding brands who hosts our mobile site and they said not to worry about it since windows phone accounts for 0.7% of our traffic. Also since the update, there is this annoying app-thing called cortana that is supposed to keep you company like Hal from 2001 Space Odessa.

I really like it, so I am so sad to say it does not work with T-mobile, at least in Seattle, Washington. I called T-mobile and spent well over an hour talking to multiple people and trying every option (changing sim card, settings, location, etc). I even went to the t-mobile store in person because I wanted this phone to work. The problem they tell me is that the towers in my area have been upgraded (August last year) and no longer support this phone. They report if I am in an area that has not been upgraded that my phone may work. So I guess it was not false advertising that it worked at one time with T-mobile, but you would have thought if it were a new phone that they would have made it compatible with the latest technology.

4195,B00KM10ITK,Mathew D. Zemek,1,24-Jun-16,True,Don't Risk It,"I have had two of these devices. The first lasted about two weeks before the primary side button, used for turning the phone on and off and for unlocking it, stopped functioning entirely. I was only able to unlock the phone at that point by plugging it in to charge. This was, as you can imagine, fairly impractical. The replacement phone lasted six months before facing the same issue. During the months in which the replacement was working, I also faced the issue of the phone losing its ability to connect to wifi networks. It originally was able to, but at some point began experiencing an issue where it would see the networks, but could connect to none, regardless of security type. This was only solved via a factory reset. Again, not exactly practical. There have been other minor issues - Google Maps is locked out (probably Microsoft's fault), the browser crashes moderately frequently, and I can't uninstall all of the apps which I don't want - but those would only be enough to bump it down to four stars without other problems. At this price point I don't expect much, and an LTE capable unlocked phone at $50 can get away with a lot of annoyances before it's not worth the cost. Still, at any price I do expect a phone that works, and sadly this one simply doesn't. This isn't meant to be a knock against Nokia, as they were very helpful during the replacement process.

13972,B071ZDQ6MV,Petros Electric,2,24-Jul-18,True,Nokia service needs some serious improvements.,"I bought this phone in August 2017 here on Amazon but it was delivered some time later (no stock at time of order). I've been pleased with the phone with one exception - every once in a while people complained they were hearing my voice garbled. About two weeks ago, the main microphone stopped working completely, so I sent it to Nokia for warranty service. It did still work on speaker phone (separate microphone for that). I received the phone back today together with a letter and photos explaining that my phone has major corrosion damage to the board near the charging port caused by ingress of liquids, which is considered abuse and therefore not covered by warranty. This phone has been in some form of case (either a basic case for the first week or two, an original Nokia flip case (since Sept 2017) or a leather flip case (since Feb 2018)), it has never fallen in a puddle or snow, has never been submerged, and has only been subject to water in the normal, unavoidable sense of a few raindrops here and there or sweat during hot weather. I took it to a local repair shop this afternoon together with the photos and letter. The first comment the tech made after looking at the photos was that the charging port is open to the inside of the case, so there's no way to keep moisture out of the phone under normal conditions, especially when the phone is cold and subjected to a warm, moist environment (like coming in from outdoors in winter, exiting an air conditioned building or car etc.) which will cause moisture to condense on the inside components of the phone. What I find most annoying is that Nokia service never contacted me while they had the phone to explain the situation or offer to repair it for a fee, so now I'm stuck for another unknown period of time with a loaner phone while I wait for a quote to repair my own phone which is less than a year old. I understand that this isn't a flagship phone, but it's not a $89 Chinese budget phone either, and it's build quality would never lead the user to believe that issues like this would happen (I've been a Nokia customer since the early 2000s and owned everything from my first basic candy bar phone to the E60, E75, E52 etc., all of which were excellent phones). I don't know whether a design issue like this is a portent of future penny pinching by the new owners of the Nokia brand, or whether it's just a stupid one-off mistake that affects this model. Either way, it sucks that customer service is so poor in communicating with the customer, not offering options for repair, and blaming the customer (and consequently denying warranty coverage) for something that can affect the phone through no fault of the user.",5.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

I use Microsoft services like OneNote, Excel and SkyDrive alot for work and they integrate seamlessly with this phone. I haven't really found any apps that I couldn't live without that were missing on WP8 compared to IOS or Android. My only complaint is that I have had to reboot the phone, due to minor glitches in apps, more often than I did with WP7.

1653,B00A2V7BA4,D. Rambow,5,24-Jan-13,False,"Nokia 920, an excellent phone including Win8","-- I have owned this phone for 1 month, and it has met all my expectations and more. We actually purchased two at the same time, and have been very pleased with both. Back in the 90's we had Nokia phones, but the last two sets were Motorolla, now it was time to give Nokia another chance, especially with Windows 8. -- So far, we have only had one glitch, and not the phone's fault. We let the phone go too low on the battery, and my wife started hitting the various buttons to get it to come back on, not realizing there was no battery power. I called ATT for assistance, and the tech was very helpful, but following the instructions, could not reset the phone. We were instructed to take it to the ATT store. We did, the store tech, said, oops, the phone support person gave you the instructions for a different phone, after a quick re-charge, he hit the three side buttons at once for 5 seconds, and the phone was back to life. All was good. -- I did learn, that some settings need to be set from ATT, where they make connection directly to the phone and make changes. I personally don't like that process, but that is the world we live in, not the fault of the phone. -- One app that already paid off, was the 'find your phone'. My wife went to an appointment using her phone as a navigator on the way home. All fine and good, but hours later, she could not find her phone. My usual procedure was to call her phone, and listen for the ring. But this time, no ringing was heard. So we called up the app on my computer, and it showed the location in our driveway. Sure enough, opened the car door and heard ringing, finally located the phone under the car seat. -- We have found the Nokia apps to be excellent, mapping and navigation is especially good. Phone calls have been crisp and clear. I tend to use mine for long business calls, hours sometimes, on speaker phone, and no problems. -- And speaking of those long calls, having the wireless re-charging pad has been great, just set the phone on the pad when power gets low, and I just continue my call. -- I have had many tell me, ""don't get a windows phone"", but then when questioned, they admit to never have seen one. And when they see the Nokia, I hear a lot, of ""it is so fast"", ""image is great"", etc. Turns out, it is very easy to customize the windows tiles, and get the apps and functions right up front that you use most of the time. -- And the camera, at 8mp, is better than the actual digital camera I have carried for years. The image is great, even in low light. I have tried several apps, one taking 5 shots in quick succession is great to get one good portrait. And the panorama app, really easy to use. Still more to try out. -- The usual apps to find restaurants, mapping, internet, email, are all excellent. Much more to try. We travel all the time, and being able to hit the find icon, type in the name of the place we are looking for, and getting directions practically instantly, is great. And the turn-by-turn voice instructions are easy to understand, and timely, as you hear the name of the street, just before you get there, not as you are supposed to be turning, like I have seen on other devices. -- I know the number of apps available for Win8 are far behind the others, but more are being released every day, and so far, I have found plenty to try out. My wife found Angry Birds right away, did the 99 cent download, and was happy to have something to do when waiting for me. -- And yes, you do have office apps available, I haven't done much with them yet, but they are there. Plus the usb hook-up to computers is easy and fast. There are dozens of help emails and such from Microsoft and ATT to help you get the most out of your phone, I haven't read too many yet, but do read the start-up guide, and you will be able to figure out most on your own. -- In my opinion, Nokia is back, with a great phone.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
20505,B07HD3QC65,Jules Mazarin,1,24-Feb-19,True,"Basic Fail: Low call volume, unless you turn off LTE","Tried calling someone with this new Nokia 7.1 phone, and she couldn't understand me because the volume of my voice was too low. I made sure I had in-call volume on the Nokia turned all the way up. I'm on T Mobile in a major US city, and I have not had such problems previously. Some further calling corroborated the problem. I could hear the other side OK, but they said it sounded as though I was mumbling. Looked up this problem, and it seems to be a common complaint for recent Nokia phones. The cure seems to be to switch off the LTE capability. Everyone says they can hear me now. Some people said to update the phone app via the Google Play Store. Did that first, but it didn't make any difference. In case people have forgotten, one of the primary reasons to have a phone is to TALK to other people. I may be old fashioned, but I still think so, anyway. Shipping phones that don't do this well is a pretty fundamental failure. I'm not sure what impact turning off LTE has on data speeds. Data speeds on cell phones have always been a murky area dominated more by market-speak than reality. For example, LTE stands for ""Long Term Evolution"". I am not kidding. Apparently, it was a ""standard"" devised to hide the fact that mobile phone makers were not really reaching 4G data speeds. I think ""4G LTE"" really means ""4G Later Than Ever"". Not sure yet if I am going to try returning this thing, or just put up with it. I'll see if my 87 year old aunt can understand me--that should be the acid test. Update, Feb 26 2019: OK, my aunt could understand me, so I guess I'll keep it. So what if I have no LTE; I literally don't know what I am missing. Also, I've invested two solid days of work making this phone's user interface look like I want it to, and I'd hate to do that all over again. On that note...Google, you suck! That stupid OK Google search bar was the last thing I (finally) got rid of. I installed the Nova launcher from the App Store, so that gave me a measure of control over how my phone looks. ------------------------------------------------------- Update: 23 May 2019: There's another problem with this phone: the interface is super-sensitive. It's so sensitive that it does stuff even when I'm not touching the screen. I hold the phone by the silicone cover I got for it, and the camera comes on. The camera is the rightmost icon, near my pinkie when I'm holding it, so I think it's sensing the mere proximity of my pinkie. A friend who has the same phone (Nokia 7.1) says it does the same thing for him--it initiates random actions, and rearranges icons by itself. Sometimes, the miraculous actions performed by the phone are consequential. I was on the phone talking to my lawyer in Germany (from the US). I switched to speakerphone, and put down the phone preparing to take notes. The Nokia immediately put my call on hold, and arranged to dial a conference call...with 911. I had to spend a couple of minutes convincing the police that this was NOT an emergency, then call back the lawyer. If I could subtract the last star from my rating for the Nokia 7.1, I surely would. The phone has done this sort of thing many times before--it spontaneously dials random numbers, especially when I'm already talking to someone. This was the most memorable incident, however. After I got done negotiating with the lawyer, I hurled the phone against the wall with full force. It bounced back to my feet, happily turning the camera on. So I hurled it two more times. Because the phone is still working as well as it ever did, I will give it an (imaginary) one star, and admit that whatever its other deficits, this is one heck of a tough phone.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

2499,B00E45043A,John,4,24-Dec-14,True,I really like it,"Nokia always made incredible phones in terms of hardware and software and I was really sorry to see them lose market share to the point of going out of business. Nokia voice quality beats anything that is out there on the market today. Microsoft's purchase has kept them alive and this is an incredible piece of hardware for the price. As many have noted, although AT&T won't like to publicize it, this phone can be operated without a Sim card. You won't be able to make phone calls or get cellular data, but it is an incredible value as a Wi-Fi only tablet, music player, real GPS with GPS chip device, email reader, camera and so much more. Insertable Sim card, replaceable battery, it's great. Given the choice between spending $600 to $900on an iPhone or $25 on this, the decision was easy for me. The only issue with this phone is Microsoft and their updates. The actual OS is fine and reasonably intuitive. However, when I plugged this phone in, it updated itself to Windows 8.1, which just like a PC easily took a couple of hours. I then downloaded maps for the entire United States for the GPS app, and that took nearly 4 hours. iOS and android Devices do not operate like PCs in this weird Microsoft your time has no value way. Now that the phone is up and running, it is amazing and I would highly recommend it.

14223,B071ZDQ6MV,Andrew D. Lossing,4,24-Aug-17,False,"Punches way above its weight (update: some issues, which can be resolved)","UPDATE, 1/12/2018: There have been a couple problems which have cropped up with this phone. Not insurmountable, as I found a temporary fix within the first day, and have a more permanent fix now, but the issues affect important apps (Android messages and Android clock/alarms) and there has been NO official help from Nokia Support. I learned to fix the problems myself. That's not a good thing for a smartphone manufacturer who sold over 10 million phones in 2017, its startup year. It turns out that, after a couple app updates in December, the Messages and Clock apps, among others, were misconfigured under the settings submenu ""battery optimization."" With the optimization turned on, messages never arrive, and alarms don't sound. Those are important issues, and Nokia Support should have rushed to provide a fix. Plenty of Amazon customers have reported the issues in reviews, and Nokia responds to most of those with a generic message, so I know people from Nokia actually see the issues. The fix is as simple as going into app settings, special access, and battery optimization and switching optimization off for those apps. But I had to learn that myself, the hard way. This is still a good phone, and I still like it a lot. I don't even believe the hardware or Nokia is to blame for the problems. But it is an issue they should have fixed in over a month's time. Also, there is a 2018 model coming out soon which offers significant advantages (faster Snapdragon 630 processor, RAM upgrade to 4GB) along with a few disadvantages (removed 2nd speaker, no Dolby Atmos, slightly worse placement for fingerprint scanner). The best part is, the 2018 model will hit at the same price point, and with its upgraded internals is an even better deal. Unless you can't wait or plan to upgrade soon, I would recommend holding off this phone for the updated model. ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS: I've been a Nokia fan for a long time, and was a big fan of the Lumia devices, which I owned three different models of during the days when Windows Phone was a more viable option (or at least when it was still alive). Unfortunately, that Microsoft deal ended up being the death knell of Nokia devices - at least here in the US - for quite a while. Realizing that HMD Global is not the Nokia headquarters of old, I came into this new era of Android phones wary of whether they'd live up to the name. After a couple days with this phone, I think they do - and at a remarkable price point. First off, the design is not as striking as the Lumia devices. Those bright polycarbonate shells were cheerful and functional, but designed to offset the clean, square look of the Windows Phone OS. The Nokia 6 is a more traditional Android device: a slightly rounded, rectangular black slab. It wears this look very well, and all of the comments on the quality of the workmanship are correct - this thing is solid as a rock, and feels like a flagship device. Once you power up the phone and start utilizing it for tasks, the ""mid-range"" class becomes a little more obvious. The 1080p screen is nice and perfectly serviceable, but coming from a fancy Galaxy Note screen it doesn't have any wow factor, which is fine with me. I would like the ability to switch color profiles, which apparently the Chinese version of this same phone has. The default profile, which can't be changed on my version, is a tad bit cool (I see no hint of cyan hue mentioned in another review). It's a solid display, with tough gorilla glass to resist scratches. Still punches well above its weight. I tested the speaker next, as I listen to a lot of podcasts on the go, often using the phone speaker when I'm multitasking at home. It's fine for voice, but doesn't sound particularly good for music at higher volumes. Still, few phone speakers do, and that's not the right way to listen to music anyway. I tried switching off the Dolby Atmos feature, and the sound was noticeably worse, so there's no reason to ever switch it off. All in all my Note had a better speaker, but you'd only notice it for music, not spoken word. Volume is perfectly adequate. I've had none of the WIFI issues reported by other users. Apparently certain routers use channels which the phone can't pick up on. Fortunately my home router is a good one (higher end TPLink) and I had no issues. I haven't had problems with any of the WIFI hotspots around town that I tend to use. Android 7.1.1 is great on the device, and runs flawlessly. If you were worried that the phone would hiccup or generally run slowly, there's no real sign of that. The Nexus 6 that I used to own, and tried again recently, runs much more slowly despite having an 800-series Snapdragon processor. Interestingly, both the Nexus 6 and the Nokia 6 operating systems are encrypted by default, with no option to run them unencrypted. While that encryption slowed the Nexus 6 way down several years ago when it was released, it doesn't seem to hamper the Nokia. I will update this review after further use, but so far the 6 proves that a truly good phone can be had for under $200. Is it as good as the $700+ Note 5 that I had previously? Well, no, but it's over $500 cheaper. I think we have been slowly conditioned to pay way too much for an everyday smartphone, and I for one am perfectly willing to make a life change and stick to a phone at this price point as long as I can get it for this level of value and attention to detail. UPDATE 9/16/17: I'm still very happy with the performance and value of this phone after using it for a month or so. I'd been weighing it against my Galaxy Note 5 and, while the Note has undeniably better components, such as camera (although not by much - flagship phone cameras have gotten a lot better since 2014), screen and processor (and an extra gig of RAM), the Nokia is STILL a better package. The biggest reason for this is stock Android 7.1. It's so smooth at this point, and Oreo will only make it better. Also the battery is so much better than the Note. By the end of the day, I still have about 50% battery. My Note typically starts begging for a charger around dinner time. The only real negative on this phone is the camera. It feels like stepping backwards to about 2011. I don't really care, as I only really need a phone camera for quick documentation, but the noise reduction smearing is super obvious in all but the best light. I really hope they update the camera app to better utilize the sensor, because I think a lot of the problem is software. I'd love to see more manual controls in the camera app, since I know I could get better performance by setting ISO manually and physically compensating for the slower shutter speed. Still the best and most elegant phone anywhere near its price bracket! UPDATE 11/7/2017: HMD Global has announced that it has bought back all of Nokia's excellent camera technology from Microsoft. If you recall the Lumia Windows phones, they had some of the best cameras around, and personally I don't think I've used a better phone camera yet than the one in the Lumia 1520, manual controls and all. This may spell great things for the cameras on Nokia Android phones, even already existing ones like the Nokia 6. HMD seems to be doing a great job supporting their phones thus far, so I'm hoping to see some advancements made in the software that will help get more out of this camera.",16.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

To start, the usb charging port was defective when I first received the phone. It only charged on one side even though usb c cables are supposed to be reversible. Then in less than a year, the phone stopped charging completely. So I contacted Amazon as the warranty was still in effect. They said to call Nokia about it because the one month return period was over. I tried contacting Nokia but none of the costumer service numbers worked. I eventually got a hold of someone through a combination of emails/live chat. It took them 4 days to essentially give me a run around of how the warranty wasn't valid unless I had a US mailing address and they wouldn't fix it even when I offered to pay for my own shipping >=\ Given how lacking the customer support has been from Amazon and Nokia, I would strongly recommend against buying this phone.

14209,B071ZDQ6MV,Zaid Q.,3,23-Oct-17,True,I really wanted to keep this phone...,"I really wanted to keep this phone. I will preface this by saying I did a lot of research on phones at this price point as there are so many competing sub $300 android phones coming from China. Pros: • 10/10 build quality. The uni-body design and the metal sheet they put inside of the phone gives it the rigidity and premium feel of an expensive device. • The uni-body premium look (mine was silver) and the slightly curved glass makes this phone look amazing. The bright screen also makes it look even more amazing. • Stock android experience with no bloatware. I also hear that there are planned security updates for this phone. This is pretty important to some people. It's also set to get Oreo! • The camera is quick and pretty decent. • Fingerprint reader is relatively quick. Although this is becoming the industry standard nowadays. • Capacitive navigation buttons (back button and multi-task button). • Slim and sleek form factor feels good in the hand. Cons: • The Snapdragon 430 shows its age in this phone. There is a noticeable lag in comparison to other phones released at the same time. It's not unbearable, it's just a bit annoying. This is what's considered a ""budget phone"" however the 430 was a wrong move. Some may not notice it but people who are expecting extra snappy performance will. • No front facing notification LED. • Speaker phone is not that loud. • I live in the east coast of the U.S. The call quality of this phone is what made me return it. You can hear people okay but the person on the other side of the call will hear you cutting in and out. The most important part of the phone is its performance in phone calls for me and I cannot have people not being able to hear me. I was able to reproduce the issue multiple times which tells me that there is a serious problem with the call quality. I tinkered with some of the settings and turned off the ""LTE enhancement"" setting at one point. That seemed to help at first but then the same problem with other people not being able to hear me persisted. Conclusion: In the end, I had to return it for the reasons above but mainly because of the problem with call quality. Such a disappointment for such a nice looking, well priced phone with stock android. I have since moved onto the Moto G5S Plus and it is a big improvement at around the same price. I purchased it at the introductory price of $229. It also has a uni-body design (the G5S Plus not the G5 Plus). It may be more expensive at the time of you reading this review.",5.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

Pros: Beautiful, solid quality build, large 6.3"" notched detailed bright HDR display, very fast (4g ram), 64g storage (expandable), gorilla glass 3, fingerprint unlock, physical button for google assistant, NFC for google pay at checkout (an often missing feature in a $250 phone), phone calls are very clear and has plenty of volume, USB-C means my iPhone family no longer steals my charge cord, Android One 9 (future OS upgrades), and installed without a hitch to my carrier with my old sim card from iPhone. OKs: Good cameras ($329 Nokia 7.2 is this same phone with really nice cameras), frame is polymer not aluminium makes for a very strong but slightly thicker phone, battery life - makes it to my night stand every night, face ID is good for people without fingerprints. Cons: Get a case as both sides of phone are glass (get a clear case because the phone is too pretty to hide), polymer frame is a little bit thick. Over time, I've gone from Windows phone to Android nougat to iPhone and now back to Android.

1439,B00A2V7BA4,Jeff B,5,23-Nov-12,False,It's alive,"I received my 920 3 days ago and I'm not sure I've put it down since. OS - After tiring of the endless pages of icons ala IOS for 2 years, I was hooked on Windows phone once 7.5 came out. 7.5 was peppy. Windows Phone 8 absolutely screams now that it supports multiple core processors. This is a first class mobile OS in my opinion and has no problem competing with IOS and Android. Plus, it feels alive. Live tiles make the screen jump out at you and it's true, a lot of times you don't even need to fire up an app to get the information you need. But it only (?) has 125,000 some odd apps or so to IOS's 700,000. I've yet to find an app I need that I can't get on Windows Phone 8. It may have a different name than you expect, but this ""app deficit"" you hear about is nonsense in my opinion. Every major app I can think of is here. Web browsing is awesome. IE on Windows Phone is a million times better than IE on your desktop (they should just use it there too!). All the apps just seem to work together and the integration is fantastic, i.e., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, it all shows up for your contacts. Hardware - You could hammer a nail into a 2x4 with this phone. It feels like it's made of aluminum or magnesium. It's a pleasure to hold and looks amazing. The matte colors especially (blue & black), I'm not a huge fan of the glossy ones (white, yellow, etc.) but that's a matter of personal preference. Gorilla Glass 2, wireless charging, NFC, it's all here as well. It is heavier than an ultralight phone? Yes, in the same way that a Honda is heavier than a Yugo. Is it made of plastic? Yes, in the same way that a bullet proof vest is made of plastic. If you haven't, go look up how this phone does in drop tests / durability tests. You'll be very impressed. One thing about the battery, and I've also read this elsewhere, the first charge runs out abnormally fast, just a few hours, but then it's fine. The battery seems to need to be primed. When you get the phone, fully charge it, then let it fully drain through normal use (I got about 6 hours of charge). Then fully charge, let it drain completely again. By the 3rd time, my phone lasts well over 24 hours on a charge with everything including NFC turned on and plenty of use. So just be aware you need to fully charge / fully deplete the battery a few times. Cons: I'd have to force myself to find some. I noticed Nokia Drive (beta), which is a great turn by turn navigation app exclusive to Nokia, seems to get tripped up a bit when you don't follow it's directions exactly and can take a few seconds to catch up to your actual position again. But otherwise it's great, it has several voices you can download and also lets you download maps ahead of time on wi-fi so you don't have to do it over cellular while you're driving. If I think of any others I'll put them up here. Summary - Pure awesome, highly recommended. You'll love your phone again. UPDATE 11/24 -- After many more hours playing with this phone: The start screen is absurdly customizable. It's literally a blank canvas and you create whatever layout suits you. Whoever came up with Windows Phone 8 was saying ""YOU should figure out what your phone should look like, not us"". As far as the battery goes, I keep fully charging, fully discharging it, and I'm easily getting a day and a half on a single charge now with everything turned on and quite a bit of use.

One of the main things I love is having Netflix on my phone. I was very happy to see that Netflix is available for WP8 and works great.

2357,B00CQAODG4,Adam B. Claar,5,23-May-13,False,I love this phone.,"Just the background...I got this phone as an upgrade on Verizon Wireless. I was previously using an Android based Thunderbolt (first LTE android phone for VZW). I had watched a buddy use her Lumia 920 so I had a decent idea of how Windows Phone 8 works. I have never previously owned a Windows based phone. 1. Speed. Initially I was worried that this phone would be slower than it's 4 core Android counter parts. This phone only has 2. I was honestly surprised. It is as fast as any of my buddies Note 2s and even their new S4s. Speed to use this phone is really fast. 2. Camera. This is best thing about this phone. I would suggest going to Youtube and watching some HD test videos (user videos...not Nokia commercials). The camera is truly amazing. The Xenon flash is great at night but just the day to day video and camera work is awesome. I love that I can just touch the screen where I want the camera to focus. Nokia has given you some really great applications like the panorama application which basically guides you through taking 3 photos that it stitches together to make a panorama shot. Applying a filter like Instagram is quick and easy. I also like that you can upload to SkyDrive automagically. You don't have to but you can. The 100GB storage is $50 or $6 a month if you need the maximum. It is the least expensive of the large capacity cloud storage solutions. *NOTE: There is a dedicated camera button on the Lumia 928 that takes you directly into the camera. 3. Battery life. I finally have a phone that I can go through the whole day on one charge. I can charge it at night and that is all I need for the whole day...whether I am surfing the net or my daughter is watching Netflix. YES!!!! 4. Nokia Here/Navigation. This took a little getting used to. At first I was frustrated with the maps because they weren't up to date. I then realized that you could download the maps directly to the phone in case there wasn't a data connection (nice to save on bandwidth). After downloading the new map for the US everything worked beautifully. *NOTE: If you leave Here turned on Nokia is smart enough to know what the speed limit is and will ""ding"" at you if you are going over the speed limit. This sounds trivial but I have to drive through several school zones on the way to work and occasionally find myself 2-3 miles an hour over the posted 25mph speed limit. Instead of having to watch for kids and also my speedometer...I just get a handy ""ding"" from the phone that lets me know that I need to slow down a little. Limitations... 1. Apps. If you are an app geek you will be disappointed in the selection of apps. On the plus side you can load up your apps and still get the same speed out of the phone vs. an Android phone. My daughter likes the way games look on the Lumia 928 better than on my old Android. I would say that is just the hardware upgrade. For a limited time if you buy a Lumia 928 you get $25 from Microsoft and Nokia to use towards apps in the Microsoft app store. ...overall...I am extremely happy with this phone. It is the first phone I have owned and really liked in about 4 years.",40.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

19378,B07DD71K4D,M. Potter,5,23-Mar-19,False,The value seems to be there,"I've owned mine for a month. After an iPhone and two Notes, I decided I wasn't going to spend a week's pay on a mobile. Wirecutter's review of phones basically said that the Nokia 3.1 is as low as you can, still getting a good phone. I found a discount mobile service giving away three months of service with the purchase of a phone. The 3.1 was among them. I'm now a month in and very pleased. (Will revise review if performance deteriorates.) Let's get the one bad thing out of the way. If you're old enough to have had a cheap Kodak camera from the 60s or 70s, this is worse. With an app like Snapseed, you can make most of the photos that come out poorly into something fair, or good enough, but not good. With enough daylight, outside photos turn out well. Otherwise, it's hit or miss - and I haven't yet been able to reliably predict when it'll be good. So the camera gets a D. It works, but quality is erratic. I was afraid I'd sound like I was in a tunnel (or others would). Fear not. Call quality: A. Twice in a month, it's gotten to the point where I restarted it because it got sluggish. Otherwise, have had many apps running at once, no problem. (My only game is bridge, so I'm not taxing it like you youngsters may.) I do stream video and audio - so far it hasn't buffered (a la '00s) or gotten glitchy once. Even with VPN, it's quick. Once again: A Once or twice the battery ran down faster than I liked. Every other time it's done incredibly well. I'm getting into the habit of charging every other day. Something I couldn't do with my other smartphones, even when new. A The sound is poor, like every other mobile I've had. Because Nokia includes a pair of earbuds at this price: B People rave about Nokia's build-quality/solid materials. I think it's good. Probably better than the other smartphones I've owned. But I still put it in a case. Still wouldn't want to drop it on a sidewalk: B. I realized very quickly that, with as little I do on a mobile, I'd need to put in a memory chip. It was an extra $20. Maybe it was a way of keeping the price down, but it doesn't really seem right to sell a phone with only a third or a fourth of the memory left. Though Nokia does give a slot for the memory chip, which is more than many: C+ The value is where it really shines. If I'd paid $1200 for this phone, I'd be ticked. For the price, I'm pleasantly surprised. For anyone who thinks four figures is an absurd price to pay for a mobile; for anyone who just wants a good phone at a good price, I highly recommend it.",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - White - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DD71K4D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rmi1HiNQL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DD71K4D,64,109.0,0.0

He even made the SIM card up, installed it, and tried to get it to connect to their 3G network -- no dice. I'm sure that this issue will only become worse as 3G grows smaller and smaller in the rear-view mirror of network infrastructure, so I can't recommend that anyone get this phone. I've started the refund process with Amazon, hopefully I can at least get my money back. I don't know why Nokia wouldn't just integrate 4G into this phone if they intend on selling it.

It has always been a bit loose, but I was able to charge the phone with no problems until one day out of the blue I couldn't. Cords won't seat properly in the port, and the phone will shut down and power up constantly on its own. I'm at the point now of trying to find replacement parts because repair shops are all telling me they cannot fix the phone because they don't have parts (I'm in the U.S.). I contacted Nokia about warranty services, but after a couple of hours, I gave up. I basically have a really nice looking brick at this point. I wish I had done more research prior to purchasing this phone. I know a lot of phones have charge port issues, but this particular phone has been the worst that I've had as far as charging goes.

To soft reset the phone (just a restart without erasing any of the information on the phone): Press the Volume Down + Power keys at the same time for about 10 seconds. To hard reset the phone (deleting all the content and resetting the phone to like new status): Press the Volume Down + Power + Camera keys at the same time for at least 10 seconds. If the phone becomes stuck on the screen with two gears turning, follow the following instructions to successfully start the phone to the welcome screen: Normally, it takes only 30 minutes at most to hard reset it. In the event that it would take longer you can press and hold both on the volume down button and power key for about 10 seconds then the phone should reboot. Make sure that you try this while the phone is charged. If the phone would still be stuck to spinning gears, here is a hardware reset that you need to press: Input these keys on the following sequence, press them one key at a time BOTH during the Nokia logo screen and the AT&T logo screen: Volume up Volume down Power key Volume down The gears will continue to spin for about 5 minutes, but then the phone should restart back to the ""Welcome to your phone"" screen. Success! ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Original Review: First, let me say that I am a huge Microsoft fanboy and I generally love their software and devices, even if there is a small glitch or deficiency. I have owned three different generations of Windows Phones over the course of nearly 2.5 years. I bought my first generation Windows Phone 7, the Samsung Focus, the week they came out. I never had any problems; it was rock solid, both hardware and software. My second Windows Phone 7.5, the HTC Titan, the week it came out. Again, I never experienced any problems; the hardware and software were without bugs, glitches, or defects. Needless to say, I was stoked to buy the Nokia 920. I followed all of the press events and unofficial leaks for months before its release. I bought three 920s the first day they were available (one for me, my Mom, and my Dad). Before I explain all of the problems, let me share some of the positives. The camera is superb. The screen is beautiful. The stereo speakers on the bottom are loud, clear, and the best I have ever heard on any cell phone. The call quality is superb on both speakerphone and earpiece. Nokia Music, Nokia City Lens and Nokia Drive are really unbelievable. Nokia Maps leave a bit to be desired, but they are better than iOS5. I truly wish these phones weren't ALL DEFECTIVE as I would really prefer to have kept it for the next year or two. As I describe in the following, the problems continue to mount on all four folks I know with the Nokia 920. The first week I had to exchange mine at the ATT store because it would not charge; although, later, I learned that the Nokia 920 is very finicky about getting a high amperage charge when its battery is very low. So, the first phone was not defective, and ATT store reps did not know to instruct me to use the OEM Nokia charger or a high amperage charger when the battery was very low. I also later found out that I could use a Belkin 2.1A car charger when the battery was very low; therefore, it was apparent the OEM charger is not necessary, but a high amperage charger is. That was the first return. In the second week, my Mom's phone began glitching when receiving text messages. Her phone would freeze and lock up with the text notification bar at the top of the screen. The fix was a soft reset, by holding the volume down + power button for a few seconds. But this happened several times and was not acceptable for a new phone. So we took hers back to the ATT store and exchanged it for another. This made phone #4 for us. Within a couple weeks I contacted Nokia Care to inform them that our phones were not outputting a sufficient volume and were not driving our external speakers around the house that we were familiar using with our other phones. We all purchased in-line headphone amplifiers to use so that we could get sufficient output. Luckily, an update released in December fixed this volume issue and we no longer needed our $30 worth of headphone amplifiers. About 25 days after purchasing, my second phone began having problems playing video podcasts. It was stuttering during playback. I contacted Nokia Care and they suggested I hard reset the phone, which deletes everything and returns the phone to like new status. When I reset the phone through the option under settings, reset your phone, it became stuck on the Nokia logo splash screen. I called ATT to get help and they said to soft reset the phone. It then rebooted and became stuck on two gears turning (boot splash screen). I called ATT back and they advised that the phone was ""defective"" and I needed to return it for warranty replacement. I had to pay $15 to get overnight shipping for the replacement. This was now my 3rd phone and #6 for the three of us in the family. Now just day before yesterday, I began experiencing the video playback stuttering with video podcasts. I tried deleting and unsubscribing the podcasts, then re-subscribing and re-downloading them. Unfortunately, the phone still stuttered during playback. I contacted Nokia Care and they advised me to soft reset the phone. It still stuttered. They then asked me to hard reset it; unfortunately, this would be the fourth time I had to set this phone back up from scratch. Although Windows Phone 8 does have backup and restore functionality, it is limited and does not restore the application data, login information for applications, podcast subscriptions, or the layout and setup of the live tile start screen. On reboot from the hard reset, the phone stuck on the gears turning splash screen (just like the last phone) and stayed there for nearly 15 minutes. I was still on the line with Nokia Care. They advised I do a soft reset. Again, it stuck on the gears turning screen for another 10 minutes. They then advised me to send my phone in for troubleshooting and warranty repair. They said that it could take up to 10 days for me to get a phone back in return. This was inexcusable considering the problems I had already experienced. I spent around an hour with Nokia Care with no resolution. I then called ATT again and was fortunate enough to get Jill who put me on hold as she contacted a supervisor. Upon my insistence she offered me the option to get an HTC 8X which I refused. She asked what I wanted and I said an Android phone. Today I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 out for delivery and I really hope to have a positive experience with it as it is my first Android phone. While on the phone I pointed out that my Mom's second phone is getting stuck on the notification bar, requiring a soft reset. It is also sending and receiving blank texts instead of the text that was part of the message. Her friends and family have experienced this with her phone many times (luckily not me or my Dad). The ATT rep suggested we exchange her phone again through free warranty (this will be her third 920). If Mom has more problems, hopefully ATT will give us exceptional support and allow her to exchange for a different OS and manufacturer. As a side note, I talked one of my friends into upgrading from her two year old Samsung Focus Windows Phone to a new 920 in November too. Hers froze on the Nokia splash logo on the highway on her way to a week out of town. She had to deal with a warranty replacement on vacation. Her second phone has gotten stuck on the Nokia screen once since the replacement. It stayed stuck on the Nokia logo until the internal battery ran out. Luckily the next morning, when she plugged it in to charge it, it restarted normally. She still continues to have problems with it occasionally freezing and restarting on its own. She is not happy with it and says she wishes she had kept her two year old Samsung Focus. She does concede that she loves the 920; if only it worked all the time. With all of these problems, the 10+ hours I have spent without a working phone, with Nokia Care, ATT service, warranty service, and researching issues on the web, I have become disgusted with Windows Phone 8. This is very sad considering I have always been Windows Phone's biggest fan and traveled through all three generations of the software and hardware. ADD 1/28/13: I reset Mom's phone before sending it back to the AT&T warranty department. It became stuck on the gears rotating splash screen and stayed there for over two hours. I soft reset it twice, letting it 'spin its wheels for over an hour each. It never left the gear rotating screen. It never restarted back to the OS. So, this makes the third Nokia 920 that has bricked on that screen (four if you count my best friend Barbara's phone I talked her into buying). :(",12.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1454,B00A2V7BA4,M. Dipaola,5,23-Jan-13,False,A beautifully awesome phone!,"Having had in the past HTC's, Nokia N81 unlocked(which was my favorite and in my opinion the most advanced at the time, expect for iPhones keyless keyboard) iPhones and Samsung galaxy2. I was in the market for an upgrade. Judging from past experiences and researching and reading reviews...I knew I didn't want another iPhone, as many have said not much innovation thru the years(my Nokia N81 had video calling 6yrs ago even thou no carriers in the USA provided the service)yes some tweaks here and there, yes they are lighter but most definitely more fragile. I see many people walking around with cracked screens especially iPhones and galaxy 3s, the one great thing about the iPhone 3GS was it's build and quality it can take a beating and not break. I was very close to purchasing a galaxy 3 nice looking screen good sound better than iphone 5 in my opnion, but something about the build didn't quite convince me so I decided to wait for the Nokia Lumia 920 and check it out (wasn't ever interested in Samsungs Note 2, way to large). I'm glad I waited for the 920 It feels like a premium device it reminds me of the iPhone 3GS great quality, the screen is beautiful, the color options are great(got a yellow one), Windows 8 OS works great for me the live tiles are a breath of fresh air you run you finger along the screen everything has a smooth feel, great speakers, the Nokia apps are great Nokia music pretty much unlimited music, Nokia city lens is an innovative app, Nokia offline GPS app and on are all free. NFC, Yes finally wireless charging, I lost count of how many chargers I've purchased for my Iphone. Last but not least...the camera it's awesome in dark light conditions its like magic you can't believe it, and it shoots great videos as well with image stabilization...having kids this phone is great don't have to worry about carrying a separate camera. Some people say the 920 might be on the hefty side, but if you put a case on your phone the weight is about the same, the 920 doesn't need a case checkout the YouTube videos out there. The App Store doesn't have nearly as many apps available that you can get on a iPhone or Android stores, but I have most of what I need. The OS is new so more apps will be available soon, I can see the difference in the month I've had the device they've multiplied.

First, I do not think it is new because it was not in original packaging. It was in a Lumia 900 box, but the phone was not secure in it, just kind of banging around inside. It did not come with headphones, and the manual looked photocopied, so that was not original either. So if you think you will get something like if you bought it at the store, you won't.

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but I really wanted a Lumia 900 so I took the chance. So far, so good. My seller was DealInABox, I think it was. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because it did not come with headphones and it seems to be used or refurbished and it had already been unboxed, as indicated by the phone just banging around inside the box and not being secure, as well as the photocopied manual, and missing headphones.

1798,B00A7F57EM,Someonereallyimportant,5,23-Dec-13,False,Love Hate Relationship,"I used to work at Microsoft and I can remember overhearing conversations at lunch where launch teams were laughing at how their new program was going to market with a 33% fail ratio and it was a major part of the applications that come with Windows when you get the full version. So, basically, they considered it a success that only 1 out of 3 attempts to use this software only worked. Imagine if Boeing were to adopt that sort of thinking? It would not be good. So, knowing this, I was skeptical about jumping into line to be one of the first to own a Microsoft Windows Phone. I had been an Android customer primarily for shear economics. The iPhone is a polished elegant product and they have so many great apps. The Apple product sells for so much more than, well, just about everyone else. The Android has some phones that were better than others. Some were real junk and others were very nicely done. My last phone was the Droid Incredible and I thought it lived up to its name really. It never seemed to run out of memory for tons of texts, emails, and photographs. I was pretty heavy into all of that. My phone was an extension of me, as it is with most people these days. I recently had to go 2 weeks without a phone. Can you imagine? I was constantly reaching for my Android to save the day. I wondered how high we were in mountains, I remembered my altitude app and reached for my phone. Oops, not there. I was at a garage sale and trying to communicate with someone from Russia. No worries, I had this great free app that they could speak into and it would tell me aloud what they said now in English, then I could flip the settings in reverse and answer them with confidence, but not this time. My phone was being replaced and in the mail. We jumped in the car to go for a drive and the last couple of minutes of a great old song was playing, so I grabbed my Android to use Shazam which can listen to any song for a few seconds and then tell you the name of the song, the album, the song writer, producer, and singer. It would tell you when it was produced and released, show you photos of the album cover, provide you with a link to the Artist's Webpage, and show you the best prices online and locally, based on the GPS info that your phone already had. But not that day. These smart phones in general are amazing and incredible. Can you imagine the reaction you would get a mere 100 years ago if you popped out an iphone, fully loaded with all of the best apps? They would probably have you burned for worshiping the devil or for witchcraft. The big question has been there since it all began? Should I buy an iPhone or an Android? Well, we weren't even done with that huge debate and now there is a new contender in the ring. The WINDOWS PHONE. It hit the market with all of the pizazz of a damped firecracker on a winter day. Microsoft should be ashamed of such a pathetic introduction to the world. When it was first released they didn't even have a compatible install of something as basic as Instagram. I am having Vista flashbacks, or even Windows 95. Well, it was mine and I had about 10 days to decide if I was going to keep it or send it packing back to Verizon. The lack of applications was really painful and I wondered how long it would be before MS Got it together with their beloved updates that we all detest so much on our computers. They are a necessary evil, but it would be nice if they got a little closer to getting it right to begin with. :) Looking beyond the app issue, I liked the feel of the phone. The screen was large, bright, and very clear. The software was a bit confusing since it really didn't look like anything we had ever seen on anything before. The live tiles seemed odd at first, but after a few days, I began to get it. I learned how to customize the screen and how to determine what is visible in all aspects of the phone's operations. Then there was the smoking gun. This phone had one thing that I personally hadn't had in such a long time that It frankly shocked me. This phone had a Minimum Rated Talk Time of 900 minutes and a Minimum Rated Standby Time of 480 hours or 20 DAYS. That was it for me. This brand new Windows Phone may not have had all of the bells and whistles just yet (apps), but it looked great, worked well, and had the most amazing battery life I had ever seen. It had a slow start, but the latest reviews are indicating that the sales have doubled in the last year alone and that Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone lost market share in every country reported by Kantar except Australia and Spain. I recently spoke with a Representative at Verizon who advised that the latest word from Microsoft is that they are approving approximately 100 new apps per day. They are adding them as quickly as they can screen and approve them. Its just a matter of time before they not only catch up, but possibly even dominate the market. Step aside iPhone, you may have a serious fight on your hands this time.

Battery life was excellent I could get 3 days of what I considered normal use on the phone. I had installed a SD card with a few MP3s and was able to sync it to my bluetooth devices with out a problem also was able to take calls through bluetooth. The troubles I had was due to the inability to handle group MMS. The phone was able to send and receive text just fine and even photos to individuals but once you started to send messages in groups it wasn't able to. I would not receive images that were sent to me via a group message also any reply from groups. It would show as a line in the senders thread but no actual message could be read. Then the messages would have to be cleared due to the inability to store any significant number of messages. I do have to give it props for being a cool conversation piece and everyone wanted to play snake.

1608,B00A2V7BA4,Amazon Customer,1,23-Aug-13,False,Save yourselves! Don't even look at this phone!,"This phone seems cool at first glance. The construction is definitely solid, the screen looks great, and it feels nice in ones hand. Once you start using it, however, you will realize it is actually like a Ferrari that has had its engine pulled out and been filled with garbage, manure, and raw fish scum. First, there are no apps for this phone. None that you would want to use anyway. The apps that do exist are poorly made and barely work. For example, the map application couldn't direct its way out of a paper bag. If you try to go from Atlanta to Charlotte using this application, you'll probably end up being held hostage by a Japanese street gang. Another example is the battery app. The makers of this phone thought it would be too predictable to put a way to tell battery life on the home screen itself, so you need to get a third party app. Lets say you're going to bed, and want to decide whether to charge your phone or not. You look at your battery app's live tile, and it says 76%, so you decide to just place it on your night stand. Inevitably, the next morning, you wake up an hour later for work with a dead phone. No alarms ever went off, and wonder what the hell happened.

1432,B00A2V7BA4,Tarikh Jumeer,5,22-Sep-14,False,A Rolls Royce.,"This Lumia is my first step into the Windows Phone world. And I must say that it blows away Android and iOS. The WP is simple and people who don't like the sometimes childish approach of Android or the boastful attitude of iOS will immediately love it. The Lumia 920 is a serious phone, reminiscent of the business concept of the E series. Apart from being gorgeous, it feels very solid. Ergonomically the phone is a masterpiece. Even the loudspeaker(s) is(are) conveniently located and are loud. I won't reproduce the reviews of others but some comments about the screen, camera and battery. The screen is a marvel as long as you are indoors. Because visibility is very low outdoors even under a cloudy sky. This has a repercussion on the camera. With such low visibility outside, you cannot see anything when you take pictures. It seems the camera has some trouble to focus on some subjects such as flowers or bushes. However once inside and in bright light it is stellar. Close focus is a pure joy. Almost a macro lens. The battery life also leaves to be desired. Otherwise this phone is a wonder. UPDATE: I updated the software to Lumia Cyan. You can now see clearly in bright light via a setting. It feels just like a 930. The camera is secondary if you are used to digital cameras instead.

It is a good value, and Nokia clearly focused on making it very practical, as they cut cost in areas that don't detract from the phone's usability in any way. The battery life is fantastic, no random reboots or any other problems you might expect in a cheaper phone. Even the screen, albeit being 1080p, is a gorgeous one. You can really feel the engineering that went into making this thing. In summary, this is a solid device that ""just works"", and should last a long time.

19388,B07DDD8PNQ,Seany,4,22-Nov-18,True,"Fantastic build quality, clean Android os. Buy external storage!","Nokia has a superb record with build quality and this phone is no exception. Yes...admittedly it's not the same Nokia of yesteryear; but their commitment to quality, thankfully has not wavered. The phone comes with ""pure"" Android, so no bloatware. And for the price... The screen is ""in my opinion,"" above ordinary. It's an 18:9 aspect ratio. So more vertical space. It may be a tad bit small to compete with 2018 phones, but if you've got small hands...it's perfect. One handed operation is effortless. That being said, there are a couple of, let's say nuances. Firstly, like many slim electronic devices, it's form factor makes the phone slippery at times. It's light and without a proper grip, the phone just slides right out of your hands. I don't like cases, (the phone is truly beautiful, to waste a case on)… but if you're one of those people; do yourself a favour and buy yourself a case. Secondly, this is not a flagship phone. So don't expect it to blaze through everything you throw at it. Keep multitasking to a minimum. Speed should be compared to it's price - don't buy a Honda and expect Ferrari speed. It's not the fastest but it works. It's never crashed on me once. Lastly, and perhaps a possible deal breaker for the uninitiated. The phone does not have a lot of onboard storage. As stated before the phone works well... But you absolutely will need to factor a micro SD card into your purchase. It comes with 16gigs of onboard storage; 7 of which are reserved for the OS. Two apps later and you're out of space. And like most Android devices... The phone will slow down due to overcapacity. Although, once you stick in a decent sized micro SD card, the phone works perfectly. The camera works well... But it's no Nikon. Daylight pictures range from adequate to lovely. Night time photos, as expected for the price of this phone, are not great. I hate using a flash... So photos can be a bit washed out and over processed. But you get what you pay for. Phone call audio is excellent. Music playback quality, sounds like every cell phone ever. The speaker is the size of a penny... What do you expect. Otherwise it works as intended and at times the screen exceeded my expectations. And it's a really handsome device.

20677,B07HD3QC65,G.W.,4,22-Nov-18,True,"""Good Phones Getting Cheap""","I needed a new phone for my mother since her old one, the HTC One M8, was barely holding on (could no longer open gmail app!). Among the phone selections, I was stuck between the Google Pixel XL, Oneplus 5t, and Nokia 7.1. A phone with stock android like experience, decent battery life, headphone jack, USB-C, decent camera, at least 4gigs of ram, and less than $500 to spend. So I decided to give Nokia 7.1 a chance. To start with the pros, I was pleasantly surprised how well this device turned out. This is pure as stock android is going to get as it being Android One. There's only one nokia app that's not at all intrusive, just a support app. The android version it came with is 8.1 oreo. After initial test setup, the October security update immediately came up. This certainly shows the promise of timely updates for 2-3 years. Physically, the look and the feel spells out premium. The size can easily be handled by one hand. The screen size is bigger than my Pixel XL. While the display is LCD panel, it looks almost looks like an AMOLED display, which is a very good thing. The camera is surprisingly decent. The picture quality is on par with the OnePlus 5T. Spec wise, it's a snapdragon 636 along with 4gigs of ram, overall good performance. Apps uninstall wicked fast! 64gigs of internal storage that's plenty, but also microSD card expansion slot as an awesome bonus. Speaker located in the bottom is fairly loud when playing media content. Most importantly, in the trending times of many phone industries getting rid of the headphone jack, this one has it! Big props to Nokia for that inclusion. The charging port is USB-C thankfully, enabling fast charging. Battery life is above average as long as you don't game or watch videos for hours. I was worried about the tiny earpiece on the notch but rest assured, call quality was clear and loud enough. Wifi calls do work. Earphones are included in the box which is a rare feat nowadays. Finally, that price. For $350, this phone offers more what you would expect. For the cons, mostly minors. The one major concern I had was the durability on the glass. The material it uses is gorilla glass 3 which is quite dated considering how the Oneplus 6 uses gorilla glass 6. I guess they had to cut corners somewhere. Definitely get a tempered glass screen protector and a case for better grip and protection. For calls on speaker phone, the volume is quite low. While the phone's performance is fast overall, there are occasional stutters here and here. Hopefully these issues will get fixed in the next android update. The power and volume button placement is odd. Power being on the bottom of the volume. Why not have the volume rocker on the other side of the phone? That will be less confusing for users. The notch is ugly and a disgusting trend, but oh well, guess we have to deal with it. The speaker is unfortunately located on the bottom. There's room on the chin to have a front facing speaker, so rather than a Nokia logo on the chin, why not have the speaker there? On the notification bar, there's no way to enable a battery percentage. As for the battery size itself, I do have to wonder about the longevity since it's only about 3000mAh. Forgot to mention, very little water resistance. So try to avoid spills and dunks as much as possible. I'm glad I made the decision to go with the Nokia 7.1. It's a worthy budget device for an average everyday phone user. I bought this for my mother and she's been quite satisfied with it. Phone calls, texting, some web browsing, GPS, and email checking are her main uses. The carrier she uses is AT&T and there's been no problems with calls and data reception. I'll continue to update this review as time goes. Also whenever Android Pie update comes out, I'll address things that are fixed. UPDATE: Just wanted to give an update after several days of getting Android Pie installed through OTA. Some things have been addressed such as the battery percentage on the notification bar even though it's tiny to see the numbers. Performance wise, while I didn't play around with the phone as much, my mother didn't notice much difference overall but the one slight difference I noticed is the speed of opening apps has gotten a little faster. Battery life, not much changed although we have adaptive battery feature enabled so we'll have to see if things improved there as time goes. The best thing about the update though is getting rid of the notch through developers option. The notchless option is brilliant as it implements the design of having notification status on the notch level with black bars but keep the apps below the notch. This is still a phone worth getting for the price.",6.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

1502,B00A2V7BA4,Mike in SJ,5,22-Nov-12,False,A Work of Art,"Hardware: Very modern, elegant and yet functional polycarbonate exterior. I don't think you need to put on a case unlike some other phones out there. It feels very solid and comfortable holding it. A little extra weight compared to others doesn't bother me at all, especially when this Lumia offers several innovative features (see other reviews for a full list) you can't find elsewhere. Software: WP8 UI and UX are fantastic and very fluid. Of course this is no surprise to people coming from WP7 like me. I must say, however, I'm pleasantly surprised how much faster this feels compared to my two year old Samsung Focus which was one of the most fluid performers back then. It's a day and night difference. To serious photographers like me, I think this phone's camera alone would be enough reason to buy. Light gathering capability is simply unmatched due to the optical stabilization (OIS) and the f/2.0 lens. iphone 5 has a f/2.4 lens and Samsung Galaxy III has a f/2.8, both with no OIS. (For those who don't know, lower ""f"" number is ""better"" for light gathering.) Check out pictures posted on Flickr to get an idea. Indoor and night photos are groundbreaking for a phone camera. I can finally ditch my point-and-shoot camera and happily use this phone for daily snapshots when I don't have my Nikon DSLR around.

It's easy to fall to cliche and say that it is better than the iPhone, but it TRULY is better than the iPhone in my opinion. Despite being a locked AT&T phone, there is extreme elasticity in terms of being able to personalize the device. From endless free apps, to absolutely seamless xbox live/facebook/twitter/email integration, this phone has surpassed all expectations. To boot, the phone was $50!(And before the 21st of April there is a rebate for $50 to $100 on top of that! The hardware is absolutely magnificent, feeling like the $500 phone that it really is(unlocked) and feeling like the supreme quality that has become associated with Nokia over the years. Furthermore, there are things like Nokia maps, Nokia drive, and Nokia transit that will give you voice directions on how to get places by car, public transportation or just plain maps(FREE). NOKIA MUSIC, wow! The coolest feature of nokia music is that you can download radio stations like on pandora but you can listen to them OFFLINE!!! Also, obviously, NFC and wireless charging. Wireless charging works fantastically. NFC touching works too. The voice recognition software is by far the best that I have ever used in my experiences. Not only did it understand me, but it understood my heavily-accented dad's accent! You can even send a message by only having to press one button. With it, you can also search the internet, call a contact, open an app, etc. -Far better speech recognition than Siri- The three dedicated buttons are absolutely fantastic and crucial. One takes you back one screen, one takes you to the home screen, and one takes you straight to searching for whatever you want! The speed of this phone is insane, particularly with the 4G feature which truly is faster. Between screens, opening apps, etc.l, this phone is enormously fast. In comparison to Lumia 900, it is much more attractive. Also it is more beautiful and the Windows 8 interface is extraordinary.

1456,B00A2V7BA4,Grizzly Creek Fly Fisher,5,22-Nov-12,False,I really like this Phone,"Had this phone for a couple of days, and really like it. Previously I was a user of the previous generation Windows Phone (7.5x) but wanted to switch to AT&T and this phone has so far been even better than the previous HTC HD7, which I also liked. I like all the features I have tried so far, with the included Microsoft Phone 8 feature set, as well as some of the Nokia value added features such as Nokia Drive Turn by Turn navigation (Included for free!!), and the other features mentioned in the other reviews, etc. I really like the fact that you can pick what states GPS data you want to keep on the phone, so easy if you are navigating in a place that has no data signal, you can keep getting accurate directions, and its easy to add or delete other geographic areas when needed, or you can just add a whole country. In previous phones I had to pay extra for voice turn by turn, but its included with the Nokia 920. For me the large screen, and size are perfect, and the ""weight"" mentioned by some reviews is no issue for me, but suggest that anybody contemplating purchase should try it. The touch screen seems fast and responsive too. I was able to reinstall all of my Windows 7x applications with no issue and just by using my same Windows live ID, all of my setting seem to migrate with no issues encountered. The only real negative that I can think of, is that my Microsoft Zune PC software (and my collection of MP3s purchased over the years) is not as easily managed from my PC to this phone, because my desktop PC Zune software does not sync directly with the phone nor my playlists from within Zune desktop software (or I have not yet figured it out), but rather I have to use a different Microsoft Application within my main PC to Copy the music folders\mp3s to the phone. I actually transferred the files over to the Nokia 920 very quickly, but it is not yet a smooth way to manage multiple music tastes within a family as was the direct syncing that Zune provided..........I am sure Microsoft will improve this, but it is the only negative I have seen so far....",6.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

That's with the battery saver option on. Also the Google Asst button is annoying bc it's too easy to inadvertently push when you don't want to. But I've learned you can disable the button altogether so that's helpful. And for some reason you can't install the Amazon shopping app on this phone, it says it's not compatible? I haven't found a case that doesn't obscure the power button's light so unless you plan on using the phone with no case, don't plan on utilizing the notification light. Of course you could get a clear case but it yellows over time..eww. I ended up returning and got a Moto G7 which I love. Battery lasts forever and it's a faster phone with a huge display. Observations: The screen isn't very bright unless you have it all the way up, like 85% . The camera has a delay before it actually takes a photo. Annoying when you're trying to take pics of kids, pets, etc. The photos look pretty decent though. The fingerprint sensor is placed lower than it should be so it's not very practical. I've just been using the pin to unlock since it's faster than face recognition. I do like the Google Assistant button on the side, it's pretty handy.

I'm a business man and approaching 50 and I am not interested in all of the ""cores"" and ""settings"" and ""custom ringtones"" and all the other stuff people seem to spend hours playing with on their cell phones that they think is important. I've gone thru that stage and gotten it out of my system. I used to love to geek out on my phones thru XDA developers. Been there. Done that. Windows 8 is fast, fluid, gorgeous, eye catching, intuitive, functional and easy to learn. This phone syncs my multiple emails, multiple calendars, backs up documents, photos, apps and texts to the cloud, streams music, has free GPS voice guided navigation, a monster camera, Photosynth, Sky Drive and Microsoft Office. It has over 100,000 apps as well. The phone feels good in my hand and is built better than any phone out there. There are videos on You Tube of a guy pounding in a nail with his Lumia 920. You can't break this phone by dropping it. The home screen and live tiles are very customizable, the WiFi is excellent, the apps I need are there and the Nokia suite of exclusive apps makes this phone better than any other Windows Phone out there. I just saw that Verizon is getting a version and that the cases will be brushed aluminum. Those are going to be really nice. I actually got a Samsung Galaxy S3 last year and tried to forget my Lumia 900 I had prior. I thought that, based on all the hype, that the Galaxy would be fine. it wasn't. There were settings for setting within settings and the battery couldn't go 7 hours. I used it for 2 months and swapped it for a Lumia 920. Windows Phone is just cleaner, faster and smarter an OS than Android. Well, I think so at least. So go into a store and check out the 920 and do your research and compare.

899,B00836Y6B2,ellen in nj,3,22-Jul-13,True,Want to love it but...,"I want to love this phone because there is a lot to love. But, two things have me very frustrated. The first is that in the picture it did not indicate a carrier- but when I got the phone it is for AT&T and it has a ton of their stuff on there (I am a T-Mobile customer). I cannot send pictures via text and think this is an incompatibility issue with T-Mobile and the phone being programmed for AT&T. As you can probably tell, I'm not a techie. I get nervous when I want to use the navigation app, for example, and it comes up talking about AT&T's data plan. If I use it, am I going to get charged for something even though I have a data plan with T-Mobile since it's an AT&T app? I also have trouble getting my emails, at times, but not always. Don't know what that's about. It will frequently say it is having difficulty getting a Wi-Fi connection- never had this problem with my last cheap (but T-Mobile) phone. I have googled the texting pictures issue and clearly I am not the only one having this issue. However, the ""fixes"" some techies identified have not worked for me- or some others who were having the same problem. My son also got an unlocked Lumia (710 vs. my 900) and he can't text pics either. He spent hours on the phone with Nokia but they couldn't figure it out. The T-Mobile people gave him a new sim card but said if that didn't work, it's a phone (Nokia) issue not a service issue. His new phone also doesn't get incoming calls (they go straight to v/m) although he gets regular texts and can make calls. Nokia couldn't figure that one out either. My other son, however, got an unlocked Nokia (also a 710) but it has the T-Mobile logo on it- he doesn't have any of these problems. So, now, I don't know if I should return it or keep it. I know I will end up costing me to return it. And it's a beautiful phone in every other way. I really love a lot of it's features. But, I would never buy another unlocked phone unless it has the T-Mobile logo on it (and they seem to be hard to come by. Probably will get harder now that they don't have contract any more).

Most phones, you are stuck with whatever apps they load for you and you can't get rid of them. Not a problem on this phone. Also, this was my first experience with an on-screen keyboard.

I was able to receive within 5 days the replacement but again the same issue, doing all soft/hard resets which annoys but with no resolution. I called Nokia, the support people told they are not aware of this issue, which was surprising to me as there are couple of forums on web which discusses about voice distortion issue in Nokia 920 and Nokia is telling they don't know.. Somehow i have a question whether it is windows issue or Nokia issue, please rectify it. Maybe it is an antenna issue.It is really annoying.

If your primary use of your smart phone is to text, e-mail, search, keep track of your calendar and play games, you will probably like this phone. If you actually use it to make calls, you might find it aggravating. I did use the Skype app, and the sound quality from the video call was considerably better, with very little delay, and the video from it was clear. That being the case, I don't know why the Lumia 920's call quality was so poor. It could be Lumia or it could be the OS.

As soon as I did the initial setup and connected to wifi, a whole lot of updates got installed (maybe about 6-8 of them), one after the other, requiring a reboot every time. Was a pain, but I would rather have too many updates than not have anything at all. Great thing also is that the OS is mostly clutter-free, and very few trash application in there. Initial problem I had (I have since moved on to an S9 when I got one on a deal, and this is truly a back up phone) is that it is slow. I haven't used very many phones this cheap, but I am a fairly light user. I dont game or run benchmarks 3 times a day. The only reason I buy more expensive phones is better camera (and not the fastest processor or huge RAM or tonnes of storage). Even with that light usage, I thought this phone was slow. I can get by with it, to be sure, but the sacrifice is clear. It also has very little internal storage - that 8GB runs out quick. I started installing my apps, and about 10-15 apps in (none of them a game), it told me to remove something else before I can install another one :( One thing I have to give it though - the call quality is FANTASTIC. People often used to say my voice is breaking up with my oneplus5, but with this Nokia it never happened. And I could feel the difference myself. Battery lasts quite a bit.

2269,B00CQAODG4,Prometheus A.,2,22-Apr-18,False,"Just a phone, nothing more","The phone: It functions like a smartphone, it can call, text, and use the internet. The physical body is thick with sharp edges, I personally like that but most phone addicts hate it since you can't hold it for hours at a time. In the package was the phone... that's it, no charger or anything. It had a small scratch, hair thick, 2 millimeters long. There are 3 buttons, camera, volume, and power. Its camera is old but still works well, the flash will blind people. The amoled screen type has no angular distortion of color but if you display a color too long or frequently it can ""burn"" the screen. Charging port on top and a headphone jack too, yay, screw you apple! The Operating System: It's WP 8, upgrade-able to 8.1. The app store is barren and most apps for this OS are no longer maintained or functioning. It has a lot of trouble with VPN connection due to the dev team being from microsoft, microsoft + mobile = worthless abandoned trash. It still uses Internet Explorer, no longer has security updates and since it has malware designed for it, you will forever be vulnerable to it. What can it do: It can call, text, use windows store apps (only), use the internet, connect to most microsoft services, etc. What it can not do: You can not effectively transfer files between this device and a PC, it does not have mass storage mode enabled, files put onto the phone this way will not be seen by the phone or visa versa (You have to transfer over bluetooth). You can not unlock the bootloader or obtain hardware root. This modal can not do that yet, and given its age, it never will. Other modals like a 520 or 920 can be unlocked through crack tools (so you can put a custom ROM on it) but you have to make the drivers and ROM yourself, no one wanted to make images for this, not even the Linux teams. Summary: This phone, as of now, is a mobile phone that can use a browser for music, searching, videos, and a few other things. If you want to torrent on the go, you can, but if you are THAT kind of torrenter, the fact a VPN drops constantly will be the end of you.

Great piece of hardware held back by a poor Android OS. One of the biggest complaints on my side after using it for little over a week is answering phone calls. Basically I end up missing 90% of them and have to call the person back. This is what happens. I hear my phone ring, i reach in my pocket to get it, while trying to get it out of my pocket my thumb usually lands on the Home Button which unlocks it, for a brief second I could see the Answer button but when the phone unlocks, that option disappears. I can hear the phone ringing and vibrating, but there is no way to answer it. It's just stuck on the home screen ringing with nothing showing that there is a call coming. Tried clicking on the Phone button hoping that would work, nope, does not. If i just let it keep on ringing, after a while a Answer/Decline menu will pop up from the top, but it's too late as it showes up (when does show up) on the very last ring and by the time I can answer it the call already ended and went to voice mail. Camera, takes good pictures if mounted steady on the tripod with very good lights, otherwise, well, 16Mp of blur for the most part.

The phone came brand new sealed in a box and it has no AT&T logo (upon boot or on the case anywhere) and it worked flawlessly as soon as I put the sim card in. I was previously using an iPhone 5s before I switched to this bad boy. This phone can do as much as any other smart phone (even if it's not high end). I'm a heavy phone user (specially call and email) and the battery still lasted about 2 days. Pros: - LTE works flawlessly (I'm using AT&T) - Emails were quite easy to configure (similar to the iOS) - Love how you can associate an image with a contact and it pops it up on the screen along w/ the caller's information (name, phone nr, etc). I know this is a feature on the iOS too, but, I like this one better. - Long lasting battery - Fluidity between switching apps - Good microphone, speaker and camera - Decent size / big screen - Cortana is a great feature. I've been using the iPhone for a long time and I have never used Siri. But Cortana is a different story - Has all the necessary apps (I am unsure why some people complain, because I found all the apps I was previously using on the iOS). Cons: - Gmail is a bit slower than the other emails, but that's fine - Not powerful enough to run Windows 10 (I installed the preview build for a few hours and then reverted back to 8.1) Truthfully this is a very reliable phone. It may not have a frontal camera, or an extremely expensive screen, but it does the job.

My last phone was a Nexus 6 that lasted nearly 4 years (as it should have, given the name). I loved that phone dearly and was sad when Google stopped making Nexus products. I'd basically resigned myself to a Pixel until I discovered this phone and the fact that Google was bringing the Android One phones over to the states. This is exactly what I wanted: a pure Android phone with a guarantee of updates directly from Google, and it's about half the price of the comparable Pixel phone. My only complaint is the size. Rather, the really tall and skinny aspect ratio the Nexus 6 was a 6"" screen that was nearly as wide as it was long. By comparison, the Nokia 7.1, which boasts a 5.84"" screen, is as slim as the HTC Evo I'd had prior to the Nexus. I consider this a step backwards. I don't even mind the notch, which I thought would annoy me most of all. The fact that the entire phone is made of glass is a bit weird to me, but since I never use a phone without a case, it's not that big of a deal.

1466,B00A2V7BA4,DelSegno,5,21-Nov-12,False,Amazing Phone -definitely a rival to the IPhone!,"I have been a committed iphone user over 3 generations of iphones, and I have to say that I am impressed with the Lumina 920 and I am glad I switched to this phone. I am not a fan boy of either of these platforms and I made a very considerate decision to switch Things I like about this phone: - Amazing Camera: Many pictures I take are in low light conditions (at home, out about with friends at night) and this phone camera is quite astounding. The video the camera produces is quite free of the hand shaking that I was quite used to from my iphone - Gorgeous Large Screen: I love the screen, it has excellent resolution, looks sharp, bright and crisp. Watching videos on the phone is a joy and due to its slightly larger form factor the video watching experience is less of a squinting excercise than on the iphone - Great Nokia Apps: * Nokia drive is awesome and free - you can download maps of any area of the world and use the phone (in offline mode!) as a class leading GPS turn-turn unit. * Nokia's Transfer my data is a great way to get all your contacts from the iphone into your Lumina, no Mac/PC connection required, within a minute or 2 all my contacts were transferred over Blutooth from my old iphone * Nokia music is a great (and free) way to discover new music * Nokia ships a number of awesome (and free) games - The phone is blazingly fast, animations are crisp, apps seem to load as quickly or more quickly compared to my IPhone - I really enjoy the Xbox LIVE enabled gaming and XBOX LIVE avatar and gamerscore integration. If you have an Xbox this phone gives you a great way of continuing to play in the Xbox ecosystem on the go. - Speaking of Xbox, I love the (again, free) smart glass app for Xbox that lets you control Xbox settings from your phone! - Great email client in general, including a very smooth integration of MS Office documents and the ability to pin specific important email folders to your front page of the phone - Solid build quality, unlike many reviews the phone does not seem too heavy to hold or carry around in my pocket (and I am not a giant either...) - Curved screen feels better for screen border touch interaction than the iphone - Have used the screen with gloves and it works quite well - I find the windows phone UI very intuitive and switching back and forth between the ios UI and windows phone UI the IOS UI feels slightly more antiquated, at the very least I have found the real time status update in email and social networking tiles very helpful and intuitive and advantage over IOS (yes you might get an aggregate new email count, but I dont know of a way to pin an important account or email subfolder to the main UI in IOS). Furthermore, the lock screen (start screen) can be customized to give you a status count of new emails or status updates. - A word about the apps: I have looked for some niche and not so niche apps (chromatic instrument tuners and metronomes, library of classic chess games, NYTimes reader etc) and have found what I needed at low prices or for free. I only occasionally play games, but since I have an Xbox I much prefer to play Xbox LIVE integrated games and increase my gamer score and the games on offer more than satisfy my occasional gamer streak, games on the large bright crisp screen look great - You can uninstall vendor installed apps Things I didnt like: - A bunch of redundant or overpriced/subscription based ATT apps, ie why would you want to pay ten dollars a month to subscribe to ATTs GPS app when you can use the excellent Nokia app which comes free? Same with ATT radio, ATT family map etc - most of the ATT apps on this phone are designed to be an added monthly money drain (unlike the excellent free and well written Nokia apps) - The rear camera is close to where my index finger usually lands when I hold the phone - Cant get into picture taking mode right from the lock screen (as is possible on IPhone), though there is a single touch photo button on the lower right corner of the phone which allows you to enter photo mode at any time after you entered your pin (if you have set a pin for your phone which you really should) - Wasnt immediately clear to me how to uninstall an app (click on the start/windows icon, swipe left to get into the app list, tap and hold the app then select and confirm uninstall) - Of course there are fewer accessories available for this particular phone compared to the iphone if that is important to you",2.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1173,B00836Y6B2,Burkay,1,21-May-13,False,Smart Phone with Issues,"UPDATE: MMS function is broken. The phone can neither receive nor send images and videos via text. I've tried troubleshooting it using every trick I could find on the internet including the official forums of Microsoft, Nokia and my career, with no result other than wasting almost an entire morning. And I am very tech-savvy (seriously, I've hacked all my kindles so far. I use Linux. If I can't solve the problem, not many can.) I deduct 2 stars from my 3-star review because this is kind of a big deal for most users. Come on MS and Nokia, how do you expect to survive against Apple and Android with a problem like this? UPDATE: Zune constantly causes trouble. Every time I need to connect my phone to my Win 7 pro pc, I need to troubleshoot manually from the device manager to get the PC recognize the phone. If this happened in 2004, I would understand. Back then, our standards of plug-n-play were much lower. Now, they are high and especially because THIS IS A WINDOWS PHONE CONNECTING TO A WINDOWS PC. How would the people who buy iphones feel if they connect it to their macbooks and it fails to even recognize the device? Dumb right? So, I take a star off. Still good phone for the price, but if you can afford a good android, go for it I say. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this phone new on another website (woot.com, affiliate of amazon) for 199.99, it was a great bargain for the price. I would consider buying at Amazon.com's price too. Pros: 1- Very responsive touchscreen. I can't tell the difference between the latest iphone and Lumia 900 in this regard. 2- Light. 3- Sleek look. 4- Unlocked. (T-mobile doesn't list 900 on their compatible phones list but everything works including 4g) 5- Great price. Cons: 1- Zune. To connect it to a computer you have to install Zune. Windows 7 doesn't even recognize the phone without Zune (which is ironic, because it is after all a windows phone), I don't like producers shoving down clinger-ware down my throat just because they can. The device has 16 GB memory (12 available after OS and updates). So, why the hell not install the communication protocol on it and don't make me use Zune as interface. 2- The landscape mode is a bit glitchy. It keeps going back to the portrait mode when you enter a new contact to your phone book. You have to turn and twist it a bit to get it back to landscape. 3- Not as many apps. Most app developers consider windows platform a dead-duck. So, if you want to use the newest apps, stick to apple or android. In-betweens: 1- Camera. It works well for a phone camera but nothing to write home about. 2- Sound quality. Works well. Again nothing special. The speakers can get very loud, do you really want to use your phone speakers to listen to music? Verdict: Solid smart phone for the price. It is near unjustifiable to pay triple for the newest Iphone or Android machine unless you are crazy about the apps.",9.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0

I was a bit wary of the BLU products, although they seem popular. I bought the first one used from the Amazon Warehouse in ""very good"" condition. The AT&T box was a bit worse for the wear, but all the parts were present and in like-new condition. I installed the battery and turned it on only to be greeted by the blue screen of sadness/frowny face. Some Googling showed how to do a hard reset, which solved the problem. Borrowing a friends T-mobile sim verified that it was indeed unlocked! So I ordered the second one which arrived in similar condition but without the blue screen. Unfortunately, it was still locked to AT&T and completely useless to me. So I ordered a third phone. This last phone had no problems, and was unlocked. The second phone, which was locked, will be returned soon. So the locked vs unlocked proposition seems to be hit and miss. As for the phones, they are quite nice considering the price. They do feel a bit cheap compared to the latest apple and android offerings, but I think that is to be expected. There is a surprising lack of cases made by recognized/popular manufacturers. I only find unfamiliar names with mixed ratings. I only plan to use these for in-country calling and texting.

Over-sized fonts used thematically actually works. * Wireless charging is great (costs extra for the charger) * Memory management is good, it will auto-close background apps if it needs more memory Cons: * Heavy * Big * Light color as theme doesn't look good; text doesn't turn black * Glass is not perfectly flat across middle of phone (edges are nicely beveled), noted dimples in middle of glass (not sure it affects the image but I would imagine it has to) * Bezel is large, same size phone as Galaxy S4, but 1/2"" less screen. Use/design -------------------- Pros: * Ability to change size and location of tiles is nice * Sounds are pleasant * Larger keyboard is nice, making it easier to type * Voice recognition seemed pretty good at first, more testing needed Cons: * Tiles being all one color (stock tiles) is disappointing * Keyboard space is very large, leaving not that much room on display when typing * Sometimes difficult to get keyboard to go away * Spell check isn't as smart as iPhone (not just common typos but nearby letters on keyboard) * Live Tile for email (Linked Inbox) does not update if the new mail was deleted on a synchronized account * For multiple email accounts there is no way to setup a default account to send email from Battery life -------------------- * Minimal built-in info > Good app available to show history and time remaining * Decent life on LTE mixed with 3G (18 hours) * On strong LTE signal (minimal use) all day battery life is closer to 8 hours :( Bluetooth -------------------- * Nice search features via voice * When a txt message comes in it offers to read it to you, or you can choose ""ignore"". You can also reply via voice. * It gets annoying when it's constantly chattering at you though! * It does stop/cancel it's voice prompting if you actually click on the txt on the phone. (good) Phone -------------------- * Phone history doesn't show call duration & no good apps to add feature * 2 click process to answer phone, a little annoying * Randomly seems to drop between 1X (cell signal) and 3G and LTE within a few feet (in a weaker signal area) Camera/video -------------------- * Greens appear saturated (in daylight) * Low light camera white balance is off sometimes. It appears to use a low-level red light to improve picture which causes the color to be off. * Low light (indoor) video is very poor. Illumination light does little good, typically causing distracting reflections. Apps -------------------- * No keyboard (replacement English) or spell check apps * Calendar: pretty poor implementation; > no week view > month view shows # of items but no words, even in landscape view * Nokia Maps app could not locate a gas station within 15 miles, but my GPS showed 2 within 2 miles. * Can't edit excel cells opening from SkyDrive Random Thoughts -------------------- * Some traffic from phone actually interferes with nearby computer speakers (this has not occurred iPhone4, 4S, 5) causing crackling noises.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

15272,B07579T83L,Alex A.,4,21-Jan-19,True,Works great.,Phone works just as it should with my provider. I don't have too many complaints about the phone. It's a Nokia so expect a Nokia. Its got about 3 or 4 games on there including Tetris. The one great feature I love about this phone is it does not break easily. I have dropped it a few dozen times. The most severe damage to date is the back cover pops off. I now have the huge inconvenience of putting it back on. It rarely has some signal problem where the calls cut out a little but I;m not 100% sure its my phone.

1666,B00A2V7BA4,Scrambles,5,21-Jan-13,False,The Lumia Experience is Like no Other.,"Let me first start by saying, I've used all the different major phone OS' (Android, IOS)for extended periods of time as a heavy user and now Windows 8 Phone. This phone is AMAZING, 5/5! but it may not be for everyone. But it's pretty dang close to it. Each person has their own preference on the OS/Brand(s). Android with overlays such as TouchWiz, Sense, Mytouch, and the Pure Un-adultered Nexus/Google experience. Than there's Apple's IOS with it's ""mac-like"" experience. Lastly there's Windows Phone, Microsoft's long push into the Smartphone market that functions similarly to Windows 8 on desktop. Windows Phone 8 OS: Strength #1: Seamless Syncing with Skydrive for ANY content between your W8 Devices. Strength #2: Smooth, Smooth Smooth! I've never used an OS so quick, fluid, and seamless. 920's screen also is the first phone with 60FPS(frames per second, how fast the screen refreshes when scrolling or moving between different apps) for the screen. No Screen blurring or smudging..EVER. Strength #3: Business. Office, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, etc. Strength #4: All apps are streamlined with the OS. You won't see an app that doesn't Feel like WP. (My major critisism of android; it's Too diverse in it's apps, in quality, design, and functionality. I'm personally sick of my apps on android not working how they should, and having to sort through tons of others that MIGHT work accordingly.) Strength #5: Windows has great support for updates and fixes. I've yet to see ANYONE complain about their windows phone becoming slower or having issues because of this, yet I hear it day in and day out with android. Android reqs far too much memory to run all their background apps and the excessive new features they add with every update and make you feel like you require a quad-core phone. Ridiculous. My Android phones ALWAYS get worse with an update. (Reminds me of OLD windows; works fine? Don't fix it. Main reason why this is a problem for android: Samsung, htc, motorola; all of them like to throw their own OS Theme ontop of android bogging it down and making it harder to near impossible for them to keep up with the updates coming out; aka: the interface and the design suffers and so does the end user; if you want android please buy a nexus; don't deal with the BS of the manufacturer's.) There are more strengths but I think I covered the major ones. Now here's the one two weakness' of Windows phone that may or may not set you on your way. Weakness #1: APPs. Just like advertised there are not as many apps as more hardened OS out there. *However all the major essentials are there; news apps, maps, gps, trailers, office, Internet Explorer 10 which can run the Desktop Versions VERY Seamlessly. (Auto screen calibration for size, WP type interface, etc.) THE main reason for this is because it hasn't garnered as much attention as the other OS till now. Some Business' are flat out ignoring the users to build an actual app for it. W8 is a huge push for microsoft since with the actual new W8 OS for desktop and with everything coming into fruition with cloud services everything will be synced together and it'll be a true ecosystem. Microsoft has the biggest lead with this over any other Company. Mainly because of Xbox. Xbox is Microsoft's key to success for a ""W8/Xbox Home."" with W8 Desktop, W8 Phone, W8 Surface/Tablets, and W8 XBOX. [WORK(office), COMMUTE(skydrive), PEOPLE(skype,facebook,email, etc. All goes into my Text messaging folder and I can reply to all of them in one interface easily. I'm in love with that. It's a big deal., ENTERTAINMENT (xboxlive, youtube, xboxmusic/xboxmovies,netflix etc. it's all there.] Microsoft Has You Covered. I didn't have high hopes for Windows 7 or anything before w8, but I've always seen the potential and they're in a major shift in how they do their business and I'm sure if they proceed the same way as they're doing , w8 and all their devices will be a major success. It just takes some adoption. Cause face it; if you want a true Seamless ecosystem. Microsoft is the only company who can truely deliver that to you in the next couple years. * Weakness #2: It's not nearly as customizable as android. No live wallpapers, (Live tiles instead with actual information however which is very practical rather than just static icons which was actually one major reason why I made the ""Switch"".) You can change the colors to suit your mood or style/preference/whatever, that's all I really care about. And if someone picks up your WP and sees the screen they can tell in a sense who you are. You have Office, Facebook, and ... whatever else on your main live tiles. Ok so you can than assume that person is yadaydyada. Same as you would an android in a sense if you see their live wallpapers and widgets and main apps. Like any other phone it's in a sense an extension of yourself and this and can be felt with windows phone as well as any of the other OS out there. (w7 didn't garner my interest until than, having 4 smaller apps is the same as android or ios , 4 apps per row, perfect for an actual phone for thumb reach, etc. Bigger ones for widgets, or whatever else, it works, just as how i'd want a phone to work. *5/5*. Now with the main specs: CAM: 8.7MEGAPIXELS WITH OIS - FLOATING LENS IMAGE STABILIZATION (There's no camera better, even the upcoming sony model with 13mp couldn't beat this beaut) This is the main differentiator for the 920. Processor: 1.5GHZ Dualcore - Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8960. [For android users: If you need more than a dual core to run a phone smoothly/efficiently for multi-tasking, I'm sorry your battery life will suffer as WP has no hickups as many of my previous android ""High-ends"", and I've yet to have any of my apps freeze or crash on me] It just works. Ram: 1GB [1gb is more than anyone would ever need for a phone; I so far have run 6 apps running simultaneously with that with no lag or issues and little battery drain when doing so] ""HardDrive"": The Lumia 920 sports a 32gb of onboard memory space for music, songs, apps, etc. About 2gb will be used up from the OS itself it seems. 32gb is A lot. 99% of users will never need more than that. Bluetooth: 3.0 (Although I heard a firmware update could update it to 4.0, but not too sure on that) NFC: Yes. (Near Field Communication) All of the newer high end models should and will be taking advantage of this relatively new technology. (Japan's been using it for years for Everything. Card payments, forms of ID, checking into locations, sharing content easily, etc. etc. etc. U.S. is just an emerging market so give it a couple years to take off) Wireless Charging: YES! This is a feature you may not see as majorly important but once you get used to it the convenience is amazing. I've adapted one of nokias plates to a car mount, and I use bluetooth to stream music while using the Nokia Drive GPS. The Wireless plates or QI Certified so any other wirelessly certified charging device from now into the future should be compatible with it. The pads/stands needed etc. won't just go to waste once you upgrade your phone in 2 years. Sweet! *Oh only downside with wireless charging is it that it doesn't allow for Hard-Wiring into a computer or other device. So you'll still want to use a micro-usb for transfering a lot of content to and from your phone if you choose not to use sky-drive. [Future versions of plates Should be able to get this built in; however many apps for streaming content are and will be more widely available to different devices making hard-wiring a near-dead feature besides having One for your main Desktop or PC.* DLNA: Yes. (Like stated above, this is for streaming content directly to other devices like photos, videos to a smart tv compatible with dlna or a computer) Music: Equalized by nokia built in, and it's ITUNES compatible. You download a WP program when hooking up your phone to your CPU, it downloads it for free where it'll pull all or any of the selected itunes media into the WP program. It's extremely easy, quick, and painless! Screen: 4.5' inches Resolution: 768 x 1280 - 332 ppi (yours eyes can't perceive past 300, so it's a ""Retina"") Type: IPS LCD - PUREBLACK technology. The blacks are true blacks, not grayed out like similiar LCD screens like HTC. I could be deceived into thinking its one of samsungs Super Amoled Screens but that it doesn't distort the colors. (blue-tones added ontop of all images for Samoled but not lcd) Outside: ok YUP, best phone I've ever used outside. Can see it easily even on the lowest settings, no glares or issues. Awesome! Dmg: Scratch Resistant, gorilla glass 2. However it can still be scratched! It's still glass. Get a screen protector or a Lipped-Case (makes it so the screen doesn't lay flat on surfaces). I received a tiny tiny scratch that I have no idea how it got there 3 days after use but if angled right you could see it but not at all during use. But I'm a perfectionist so this kind've surprised me. But I just put a Armor Shield screen on it cause the InvisiShield brand feels too ""Clingy"" to your fingers unlike armor which feels like almost like the screen itself and with it on the scratch isn't noticeable whatsoever, armor shield appears to have the same durability and resilience if not better than the invisi-Shield brand. BATTERY!: Standby time is ... like any other phone i've used; and microsoft is apparently getting started on working on making a Sleep Mode for their W8phones. When screen is off ONLY the major apps like text, calls, will go through and whatever else youd want to customize. As of right now it still will give you email updates, calls, texts, news updates if youd like etc. 2 days of Standby Time with some calls and texts here or there. Battery Heavy User: I work with phones and I'm constantly showing them off various OS and phones to consumers including my own 920 for WP8. Apps, movies, games, etc. I get about 10-12 hours of heavy useage. My htc rezound with an extended battery would give me 2-4HR with a new battery and if lucky. And... For people concerned about the Confined Chassis. It's not Impossible to remote to exchange a battery down the road. There's 2 screws you take out so you can peel off the back and than you have to just remove a few of the connectors that pop right off with the right tools. (Find youtube videos on it; a basic battery replacement should be fairly easy) Anyways.... I hope you enjoy your Lumia 920. or any other WP that you decide to get. (Their speeds and performance will be nearly identical; the only differences will be Camera, Screen size and resolutions, battery mah, weight, colors, etc.) Oh.... I can actually teach my technology Illiterate family how to operate a WP easily without having to show them, they love it as well. And we all stay in even better contact than before due to all the integrations between skype,facebook, messaging, etc. into one messaging inbox. ^_^",14.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1493,B00A2V7BA4,rvarghese,5,21-Jan-13,False,Great Phone,"Bought this phone directly from ATT last week as they were offering the wireless charging plate along with it. Compared to my husband's SIII this device is definitely a bit more hefty (I just had to find something to complain about). But in all seriousness I love this phone. The call quality is great and the camera is just Amazing. Now it did take a bit to get used to the tiles and overall navigation but now that I have used it for a few days, I think it provides more of a richer user experience than Android. The Nokia Maps that can be used offline for navigation purposes are a plus. As a mom I also really like the kid zone feature as it helps control what my kids can access when I allow them to play games on the phone. Did I mention I am able to charge my phone wirelessly. Even though the build quality is great; I would highly recommend getting a case and a screen protector especially if you have kids that love to play with your devices and accidentally drop em. Wish I had purchased them while at the store but I did not get them as I thought the accessories offered were plainly overpriced and there was not much to choose from. Anyways have ordered a screen protector through Amazon (was def less expensive than the ones being offered at the store, will most probably receive it sometime tomorrow...will share if it is worth the buy).

15306,B075FL4H89,kati powers,4,21-Feb-18,True,I love my Nokia 3310,"If I could, I would have reviewed at 4.5 stars. I love my Nokia 3310. I mostly use it for snake, text messaging, and phone calls. Sometimes I like to take crappy photos with the camera just to show off how un-smart my phone is. I don't need a nice camera on my phone. I have a nice camera and now that I don't have a smart phone I actually carry it with me. I'd attach my blurry nokia photos but I can only send them through bluetooth. Don't get me wrong, I love having the camera in case of emergencies. The texting was a bit to get used to but all of the necessary options are there. I really like that you can switch between text function (T9, #, ect) easily with out going to a menu. My only complaint is that if you have long conversations with a person it sometimes takes a minute for everything to load. I have heard that some people erase messages for more memory but I haven't gotten there yet. The phone calls work pretty well but once again it takes some getting used to the functions. I've had it for over a week now and I finally looked up how to hang up the phone call. (Those big square buttons actually have multiple functions depending on the location that you tap - or look at the illustrations on buttons). Snake is better than ever with the endless mode. I really enjoy that you can switch the controller style. (I prefer the old school up,down,left,right) but there are many other versions that may suit different game play. The phone has a timer, calculator, unit converter, flashlight, and voice recorder (you can make your own ringtones) My students love to give me crap about my ""trap phone"" so I brag any chance I get. Today I told them I only have to charge it every 3 days (unless I'm playing snake) and then I threw it on the ground and told them I didn't have to worry about dropping it. A student asked me how much it was and I said less than $60! I told them that I have internet everywhere I go and I simply do not need a smart phone distracting me from my everyday life while in public and also I don't want to get hooked in the cycle of spending over $500 for a cell phone. I think I'm teaching them about the finer things in life. Edit: I dropped it again to show off its durability and when it hit the ground one of the tabs on the outer case piece bent in and would not immediately snap back in place. However, I bent it back and it went back on with ease. Edit 2: The screen will not survive being ran over by a Dodge Mini Van.

This Nokia 2 is by far the best one yet for signal strength and connectivity, WiFi calling and MMS/SMS messaging over WiFi (a must have for me). Usually a T-Mobile APN or Ultra Mobile APN (the owner of Mint Sim) will work, this time - the Ultra Mobile APN worked perfectly on the Nokia 2. I'm a big fan of stock android with the monthly updates and no bloat (it's identical to a Pixel, without fingerprint or pricetag). I think it's a great deal at $98, I did add a 64G SD card and formatted it for system use for extra performance. The phone does lag as you add more apps. The rear camera is blurry. My cheek while talking on the phone puts people on hold and activates speakerphone sometimes. Apps can act a little strange at times.

1068,B00836Y6B2,Shawkins,3,21-Feb-13,False,Nice phone with issues,"I purchased my phone new at an AT&T store, not through Amazon. This phone is not as intuitive as others. Granted I'm used to the Android system and iPhones and have never used a Microsoft operating system on a cell phone. First disappointment was that some apps are completely inaccessible, including Amazon mp3 which I'm sure isn't the most popular app out there, but if you've invested any money in purchasing music throught it, it's a pain to no longer have access to that music through that app. There is no place to access downloads. Once something is downloaded, it is filtered into what the phone decides is an appropriate place. Bank apps download into the ""Wallet"" app installed on the phone. Others of my downloads have simply disappeared into the phone somewhere and I've had several people search for access to them to no avail. This includes apps and documents. I've had this phone a week and already it is doing.. odd things. Today it decided to randomly fade the screen's brightness from well lit to almost invisible (regardless of the amount of time since I'd last touched the screen and on a full battery) and then fades back to normal, repeating the fading in and out multiple times. On other phones I've used, when you use the internet and then close out to do something else.. take a call, use another app, check a text, you can open the internet back to the page you were just viewing... not with this phone. It goes back to your starting bing, google, whatever default page and if you hit the back button it just closes the internet. Also, if you receive an incoming call from someone not in your contacts and want to save the phone number to your contacts, there is no way to do so??? I'm not completely incompetent.. I've selected every possible option and there is no way to directly select that phone number and save it into contacts. It requires you to select one of your contacts' names from your newly created hotmail account (unless of course you already have one) to save the number under. If this person isn't in my hotmail account already, then what? Too many mandatory steps linking to hotmail. I'd rather just have the ability to synchronize without having to manually do it every time I want to do something simple like save a phone number. These things may be able to be worked through, but with hassle. The phone looks great. It's operating system is just, like I said, not intuitive and even during this first week of being on a new phone high, I'm already becoming disenchanted with the phone. The reason I chose this phone is for the Microsoft Suite's amazing functioning on this phone. I've tried using Word and Excel with other phones and it was possible, albeit annoying.

(kind of getting off topic here) camera is excellent, especially with beauty mode; photos are sharp and bright;fingerprint sensor is super quick and very easy to use; battery life is great; phone is made of aluminum and glass, so feels very premium; due to this, recommend using Nokia's TPU bumper to prevent damage; USB type-C connection is super convenient for charging and data transfer; love how it still has headphone jack to offer alternative to handsfree; upgraded flawlessly to Android 10 a few days ago; Snapdragon 636 makes for a virtually lag free experience minor complaints: 1. just a one speaker; don't get why Nokia didn't put in a stereo setup with two; this makes for a pretty average audio experience if not using headphones (only makes me love it more though as its my little audio invalid) 2. the microphone for loudspeaker mode lacks sensitivity a little at certain angles some of the time; not sure if its me holding it wrong or some obstruction around microphone or what",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

Although I haven't done much with it yet, it has amazed me. I'm living 40 miles from any major city, and I have 4 bars, using Straight talk. My router is in another building, and again, 4 bars of WiFi. The camera is amazing, and shows things I can not see with my own eyes. I've taken pictures in the dark, and of intricate things, and the zoom after taking the picture, is comparable to a low zoom microscope. I haven't done much with the storage yet, but while I put my SIM in, I noticed one SIM slot is blocked. The SD slot and SIM are in the same tray. I haven't dropped it yet, so can't say how durable it is. The battery has lasted me over 24 hours, but I haven't been charging overnight, and I also use an offbrand magnetic charger. I also like that the notification light is in the power button, speakers are loud, and I have had no glitches, restarts, or freezing. For just over $300, it can not be beat.

15397,B075FL4H89,ernie,4,21-Dec-17,True,"Does exactly what a ""dumb"" phone should do","I bought this phone to do a partial digital detox, wanting to reduce my reliance on my iPhone. Pros: lack of constant notifications, long battery life, fits well in the hand, it works well enough as a phone, and snake is surprisingly decent Notable limitations: * No physical volume buttons - It takes holding the # key, unlocking the phone, and them using the d-pad to change the volume. I miss being able to just quickly switch to vibrate or turn the volume up. * Took a while to get used to the buttons - the upper left and upper right are actually two buttons (the top and bottom halves have different functions), and the d-pad in the middle is awkward to use. I've got pretty small hands, and I still find myself having to use my nails to avoid accidentally navigating/clicking. Makes me wish the trackball from the Blackberry Curve. * No emoji support - while I knew typing on the thing would be worse than on a smartphone, getting text messages where I'd just see boxes made trying to guess what the other person was saying a bit interesting. Not an issue if the people you text with don't send you messages that are just emoji :P * Low res screen - I didn't think about how often people send me various pictures and what not, but there's no way to zoom in on images or anything, so you can only see it in 240 x 320 glory * Import issues - looks like the only way to import contacts is from an Android device. I happened to have one around, but when I did the import, I only got some of my contacts. Not sure what the limit was or what didn't import, but even at almost 3 weeks, I'm still getting messages from stragglers that I haven't saved the contact info * Long text messages don't display properly - These often only show one line, and I have to go back to the main menu and back in or some other voodoo to try and see the whole message. I've even got some messages that only show on the preview screen and not the conversation view. * There's only ~32 MB or so of internal storage available. Not a huge deal, and it's got a microSD slot, but surprised me as I thought I'd copy some of the podcasts I listed to it then realized I couldn't do so. It's amazing the little things you miss - the lack of automatic brightness adjustment has become pretty noticeable when I groggily reach to the phone to check what time it is, and then am blinded by the display that's way too bright in the dark. As for the digital detox, I ended up still carrying my iPhone and using wifi for various functionality. Using the 3310 definitely curtailed my reliance on it, and I've gone through and disabled most of the notifications. Also helped me build a better mental map for walking/driving instead of an over-reliance on GPS based navigation. On the other hand, I'm looking forward to again having a keyboard and autocorrect, calendar, email, ability to use ride-share and car-share, two-factor authenticator, etc.",8.0,Nokia,Nokia 3310 3G - Unlocked Single SIM Feature Phone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 2.4 Inch Screen - Charcoal,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3310-3G-Unlocked-T-Mobile/dp/B075FL4H89,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iQ4QgMchL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FL4H89,497,54.99,59.0

This was the first windows phone me or my wife had ever had in our lives and I mainly got it because of Cortana. Cortana is amazing btw (even though google now has caught up), the user interface with the tiles are really neat and you can organize them any way you want including the sizes of the tiles. With the live tiles on, they update automatically and instantly when something comes up instead of just a notification that pops up at the top. The phone itself is well built and meant to take a drop or two and pretty sleek on the design so it has alot of plusses that me and the wife like.

18,B001GQ3DJM,AM Radio,4,21-Dec-08,False,Good basic phone for the money,"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

19401,B07DDD8PNQ,Nate,2,21-Aug-18,True,"Wanted to like it, but I'm less than happy","*EDIT 2018-11-30* - ...aaannnd we're back to no updates since 8.1, still running September updates on Nov 30. Nokia still doesn't engage with users on their ""community"" forum even after a redesign/relaunch. Feels like they're abandoning the phone already with the launch of the ""3.1 Plus"" in October. *EDIT 2018-09-21* - I finally got an OTA update (28 days after the issue was ""fixed""), and can now run 8.1 with September's security updates. I haven't tested background app functionality yet, but have seen reports that it has been improved. Alarms seem to be behaving now. Night Light functionality is present as well, which is nice. There are even more Evenwell system apps now, but I can disable those (I'm fine with a ""stock"" experience and have yet to notice any loss of functionality). I'm bumping the rating up to 4 stars pending discovery of any new problems, and writing off my initial issues as a rocky rollout and budget phone limitations. *end edit* *EDIT 2018-09-10* - Dropping the rating, since I'm still stuck on May's security updates in mid-September. It's been 17 days since Nokia claimed that I'd be getting a patch ""any day now"". I'm going ahead and disabling all of the Evenwell app overlays for whatever good that'll do & replacing apps that shouldn't have web access (calculator, keyboard, messaging, etc) with alternatives, and I guess I'll just live with being yet another unsecured Android device. Maybe Nokia will eventually patch me or the Pie upgrade will come through, but I'm not holding my breath. *end edit* It's a budget phone, so I didn't expect the world from it, but even with that in mind, this phone has issues. Incredibly aggressive process killing for third-party background apps (doesn't seem to matter if you disable battery optimization for an app & let it display its notification, it'll be killed within a couple of hours - it did this for multiple apps, even when run one at a time). Somehow my alarms in the stock clock app have become vibrate-only despite a valid sound being chosen and sufficient alarm volume showing in the volume selector. There are a ton of telemetry/'customer manager'/'device control' apps & apps by unknown third parties (Evenwell, which when you google them you get reports of their apps sending device IDs & data to unknown Chinese servers even with the 'product improvement' options disabled) - some of them you can disable, some of them you can't. The bootloader can't be unlocked, so you're stuck with whatever version of the OS they eventually push out, if they ever do. This thing feels rushed out the door. ""Android One"" appears to be a sad joke, as I'm still on the Android 8.0 May update in mid-August, and the OTA update check in Settings always just says that I'm current. And yes, it did that before I ever started disabling apps. Multiple people on Nokia's forum have this problem, btw. Oh yes, Nokia/HMD has a user forum, they just don't seem to use it themselves so it's just users asking users about problems. Supposedly Android Pie support is coming this fall, but if I don't even get updates for the current OS, that doesn't do me much good. Finally, while this is a knock against Google/Oreo more than Nokia so there aren't any stars off for it, just be aware that several apps requires Play Services to be enabled even if you haven't set up a Google account - want to send text messages, or even just *type* without your phone talking to Google? Too bad, the SMS app and even the keyboard both need Play Services enabled. For what? It's creepy.

15267,B07579T83L,Amazon Customer,4,20-Sep-17,True,Pretty Good Phone If All You Want Is A Phone,"Let's be clear here. This is not what I would even call a feature phone. This is a dumbphone, sometimes in every sense of the word. My 4 star rating is not to be compared to the best phone in the world, but to other ""feature"" or ""dumb"" phones. People purchasing this should be expecting to only receive phone calls and text messages (TEXT MESSAGES, NOT GIFS, IMAGES, ETC.) There is no browser, no camera, no bluetooth, no SD card expansion, no mp3 player (there is radio if headphones are connected). Let's review those features. This phone works on GSM networks: so only T-Mobile, or one of the MVNOs that use their towers. This phone only supports 2G and there is some concern as to how much longer carriers will support it. AT&T stopped their 2G services at the beginning of 2017. For being a phone...it does pretty well. You can save contacts to either the phone or the sim card. The contacts are presented as an alphabetical list. Using T-mobile towers (US Mobile to be exact) the phone quality is ok. Remember that this isn't capable of using HD Voice or compatible technology as that requires LTE. For text messaging....this is where is lacks. While I'm comfortable with using a numpad for typing texts, it requires too many extra key presses just to send a message. Example: you receive a text, you go through the menu to text messages, click to read text...there is no reply button. Instead you have to click Opt, then reply, then type reply, and then when you want to send...it asks you to confirm the number you are sending the message to. A small thing but instead of 2 clicks it is 5....for every reply....think about that. All in all I like the phone as it gets the job done with minimal cost and distraction. It can be good to do a detox from your smartphone, good as a backup phone for emergencies (30 day stand-by with 15 hour talk time!), good as a first phone for young kids, etc. I would say this is NOT a good phone for seniors unless they have decent vision, finger dexterity, and are pretty good with technology already. This is a small phone (a plus in my opinion) with small buttons and somewhat small font on a 1.8"" screen.",54.0,Nokia,Nokia 105 [2017] TA-1037 Only 2G Dual-Band (850/1900) Factory Unlocked Mobile Phone Black no warranty (White),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-TA-1037-Dual-Band-Unlocked-warranty/dp/B07579T83L,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QNnygel4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07579T83L,133,34.99,0.0

My wife's no longer charges reliably after 8 months. You'll have to angle the cord in just the right spot for it to charge. After googling the issue it appears very common with nokia phones.

1638,B00A2V7BA4,LCQ,5,20-Nov-12,False,In a League of Its Own...,"I don't review much unless I get a product that really stands out. The 920 is that product. I own the Red 920 and actually owned a Windows Phone prior to the Lumia 920; it was the HTC Arrive on Sprint, which was WP7. Now even though that was a fairly decent phone, HTC makes cheap products so it ended up breaking in multiple areas because it was made out plastic and poorly shaped aluminum. However, the 920's unibody framework is sturdy. You can tell how well built it is when you hold it. There is not a single area that feels like it's going to break or bend or give any form of trouble. The edges are smooth and its curves make it a beautiful phone to look at. The Windows 8 Operating system is the best on the market. Anyone can say what they want but, when it gets down to it, this OS is fast, functional, efficient, and effective. Even though the App's market could use some growing, many of the apps that you would need or want on an iPhone and/or Android device, comes native to the Windows Phone Operating system. Thus, all other apps are pretty much geared to entertainment--which is, at least in my humble opinion, what a phone should do. Now to be fair, there are a few aspects that do need attention but they aren't deal breakers by far. For example, although the phone comes with Microsoft Office Suite, it only has Microsoft Word and Excel within the suite. OneNote, which is my most used and favorite app by far, is its own separate app instead of being included in the suite. Now this is a minor annoyance to me because in WP7 everything was in ONE suite/hub. Either way, its more of me being picky than anything else. The battery life is Insanely good. I can go up to 17 hours straight without needing to charge and that's with fairly heavy usage. If anyone has owned a smartphone before, you know that that's an admirable feat. My last phone barely did 10 to 12 hours. My Palm Pre+ barely got 7 hours. My wife's HTC Thunderbolt is constantly dying multiple times a day. The only other phone that'll match it is the iPhone in regards to battery life that is. Now, if you are planning on getting Windows 8 for your computer or are going to purchase a computer with windows 8 on it, then this is most definitely the phone to have (or any windows phone for that matter). It syncs up like nothing I've ever seen before. Between Windows 8 and skydrive, moving files around couldn't be any easier. I was lucky enough to get the 25gb skydrive that MS was handing out with WP7 so it's even better for me. Nonetheless, anything over 5gbs is good enough for documents and pictures. I say this because I literally have hundreds of pictures and documents (including work documents) and I'm not even close to hitting 5gb in storage. So believe me when I say its plenty enough storage. The best feature of the phone is definitely the Camera. Nokia went out of their way to create a beast of a camera. It literally takes the best pictures I've ever seen any phone take. Nearly every picture looks professional even when you're hardly trying. The low light pictures are bar none the best on the market as well. Couple that with the exclusive Nokia apps in the App Store and you'll feel like a photographer no matter how little skill you actually have. Add the fact that it's a floating lens which reduces shaking and blurring, and you can take incredible pictures that rival stand alone cameras. The ONLY con I've seen in regards to the camera is that while taking Low-Light pics, you have to be really, really still. It's the only time that movement will ruin the picture. This is because the Lens ""aperture"" has to stay open longer when in dark environments; thus, any movement will cause a blurring/streaking effect. Other than that, you'll notice more pros than cons. Rather than babbling on I'll say this...Go to any store that has the 920, play with it for a bit. It'll seem a bit alien at first but as you use it, the more it'll grow on you. After giving it a whirl, use any other phone i.e. Android and/or iPhone and you'll see the difference. If you want to have a phone that gets you what you want and how you want it as fast as possible then Windows phone is the one to have and the Lumia 920 is definitely a great choice. If the 920 isn't your gig and you'd want something more mid-range, then the 820 series are pretty awesome as well. Windows has really put thought and effort into this platform and they're leaving their competitors in the dust. Nokia is the premier manufacturer as well so the two together is like a peanut butter and jelly haha. Seriously, try one, hold it, use it...but make sure you use it as you would in real life and you'll see the difference. if you read all of this, then thanks! I hope it helped and I hope you enjoy whichever phone you choose!",53.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1665,B00A2V7BA4,Codeware,5,20-Nov-12,False,My choice Lumia 920 or iPhone 5,"So, I got on the iPhone bandwagon the day after Christmas 2009; I remember this so vividly because my mother upon seeing me pull an old ratty tiny (non-smart-phone) from my pocket was in shock. She asked if that was my cell-phone to which I boldly answered ""YES""... Her next statement had me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes; ""don't you ever let a woman see you take that phone out of your' pocket, it does not fit your' life-style"". My parents are the LEAST tech savvy people possibly on earth.., well close to it. So I figured if my mother thought that way about my phone I better do something about it, so off I went to the Apple store as I already owned a Mac Mini (now I own 2 Mac Minis). So here we are in 2012 and I am the owner of an iPhone 3GS an Apple Magic Mouse and Track-pad and 2 Mac Minis along with a Kindle Fire (2011 version) and a first gen iPad 32gb/wifi. I like Apple products if it is not apparent. My 3GS is a bit long in the tooth (I know), but honestly I didn't see anything in the 4 or 4S that would make me want to part with cash or own it. Facetime...don't care; Siri, Perhaps it would have been fun to play around with and I may have even found it helpful. I decided to await the iPhone 5, surely it would be something to become excited about. So I go check it out and I am not the least bit impressed, well, that is not entirely true I think the build quality is great but the interface simply looks like more of the same thing I have lived with since 2009. Faster yes, sharper image yes but I mean come on... to quote Al Pacino (movie: HEAT)... ""GIVE ME ALL YA GOT""!!!!. My 3GS was never painfully slow anyway. So the choice was the Galaxy S3, the Lumia 920 or the iPhone 5. I chose the Lumia and boy was I nervous about that choice. As I stated my iPhone simply works and does a good job at that. But I was yearning for a newer GUI (graphical user interface) experience and the 920 with W8 delivers impressively. I love the live tiles and the way the latest information is delivered automatically and all I have to do is glance at the phone to see said information. I read a review where a pundit wrote about why the iPhone is better without NFC and wireless charging. I found it to be complete bunk... his and others thinking suggest that you're still tethered because the phone had to be placed on the charging pad so whats the point of wireless charging. Well guess what; I always use a Bluetooth for talking (Jawbone ERA or B&O EAR 2). I love the fact that when I arrive home I can just set the phone on my nightstand (on the charging pad) and walk away.., Bluetooth still in ear as always, only now I'm not fumbling with tiny connectors. Say what you will but between multiple Bluetooth units, Kindle Fires and an iPad one less device to plug in is welcome in my home and on my desk at work. I love how the author of that review tried to spin missing feature into a ""+"", please! Now as for NFC, true it is not ubiquitous but I have seen it popping up in my neck of the woods (Chicago) so why not? The battery on this unit is herculean and I have noted that by the time I arrive home from work (typically leave the house a 6:30am and return around 6:30pm) the phone is still at least half full and that is even if I don't charge it through the day. Bottom line: Apple makes great products and I own some of them and may even buy a Mac Book Pro (retina) but I see no real innovation with the iPhone 5 and so I passed it over. My former 3GS is now used as a remote control and for my music when at the gym and I can still use most of the apps I purchased where I have a WiFi connection (I have a Clear Hotspot). The Lumia 920 at this point is the best phone I have ever owned (eliciting excitement reminiscent of the iPhone when I first purchased it 3 years ago). And yes... I have used the 4S phone multiple times (friends own it) but again, save for a few things I saw nothing that made it desirable in fact I thought the restyling to a rectangular brick was lacking imagination and a step back from the original iPhone. Not saying I wouldn't go back to the iPhone but they need to step it up. I am a software consultant developing for Windows and iPhone. Either way you can not go wrong; I think they are both top products but for me the styling, NFC, wireless charging and Live Tiles sealed the deal.

1518,B00A2V7BA4,PK,5,20-Nov-12,False,Gorgeous hardware with a much improved OS (update),"The Nokia Lumia 920 feels like the premium smartphone it is when you pick it up. I liked the shiny finish more than the matte but that's obviously subjective. The first thing you'd notice is the brightness and the responsiveness of the display. The high resolution combined with the fast OS make it a pleasure to use the phone. Even some of my iPhone-carrying friends made comments that the display on the Nokia Lumia 920 was very attractive. The static pictures seen on websites do not do it justice. You need to play with a live unit in a store to really get the sense of how good the display is. Both the front and back camera's are very good. I took some panoramic pictures and they came out very well and were easy to take using the guidance provided by the camera system. NFC works well although I have not found many places where I could use it. The Windows Phone 8 OS feels very fluid and engaging. The Windows Store has most of the apps I needed but lacks one or two key ones. I guess they will show up soon since the OS seems to have good reviews and support from phone manufacturers now. The OS lacks a few features, such as the richness of BlackBerry profile customization or the ability to touch the connectivity icons such as WiFi or Cellular signal indicators to go to their setup. However, it is a piece of cake to use custom ringtones compared to what the iPhone requires. Overall, I'm happy with the phone and the OS. Still waiting on my free wireless charger from AT&T so nothing to report on it's pros and cons yet. (Update) Received the wireless charger and it works like a charm. The color of the charger and the wire match the phone and looks great on the counter-top. I have recently had first hand experience with the mechanical strength of the phone. While I was holding the phone in my hand in a store, it got knocked by someone and fell about 4-5 feet on to the hard tiles. No damage except a tiny dent in one corner which is barely noticeable. The phone continues to work as if it never fell.

1704,B00A2V7BA4,Talvi,4,20-Nov-12,False,Dare to be different,"I've had two Lumia 900s, both suffered drops that cracked the screen (though they also made it safely through quite a few drops, I am a klutz). So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it. It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I'm loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900's vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go. Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps. I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history. The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. There are still some problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the battery life is still not great (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it's hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down. All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has. PROS *Form Factor: it's different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter. People want it, or want to try it. *Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn. Sharp. *Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction. It is also impressively sensitive. Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves. *Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface. I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I'm still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries. *Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it's optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It's zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported. *Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I'm cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc). *Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can't set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however. *Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker. *Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone. CONS *Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand. *Battery: Yes, it's a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but a little shorter battery life is the result. *Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline. The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people's hands while still maintaining quality. *My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone.

1445,B00A2V7BA4,Bottom Line Up Front,5,20-Nov-12,False,Traded in my iPhone 4 for the Lumia 920,"I just got my red Lumia 920 after it being backordered for a few days. I upgraded from my iPhone 4 which I had for around 2 years and could barely hold a charge. I'm very impressed by the phone so far. I was initially concerned that there weren't going to be enough apps in the Windows Phone ecosystem but I found that all the major apps that can be found on iOS are on this platform. When I told my fiancé that I was swapping out my iPhone for a Lumia 920, she thought I was nuts. She actually tried to stop me because we use iMessage all the time and was afraid that we would have to use text messages after switching to the Lumia. Well, I can't use iMessage on my Lumia but instead there's a great cross platform texting program called ""Whatsapp"" that's far superior to iMessage. Although my fiancé was skeptical that ""whatsapp"" was going to be any good, she now loves it and says it's better than any other messaging service she's ever used. I also showed my fiancé how I personalized my phone and is very interested in buying a Windows Phone now. Perhaps a HTC Windows Phone 8x instead as she finds the Lumia 920 a little too big for her hands. Funny thing is that she's told me that I have to always have a tile of her that's the biggest size possible. I told her if she makes me mad I'll reduce her tile size to the smallest one. haha The best part of owning this phone is how random strangers keep on approaching me and commenting on my stylish new phone. They ask me how I like it and always let me know it looks awesome. I love the fact that Windows Phones look nothing like other smart phones on the market and I can customize it with cool tiles like my fiancé's contact tile. If you're coming to the Lumia 920 from the iPhone, there are some things that run a little different that you will need to get used to. These are small things like using the back button but you'll get used to it instantly. In Windows Phone, you can have unified email inboxes but it wasn't easily apparent that you could do this. Also, if you link your phone to Facebook, make sure you filter out your facebook contacts or less you'll have hundreds of facebook friends on your phone contact list who you will probably never call. Just filter them out and you should be good to go. Bottom line: I love my Lumia 920 and I have no regrets leaving my iPhone. If you were hesitating like me about ditching iOS, let me reassure you, there's nothing to worry about - your experience with this phone will be superb. You'll love the great new features and apps on the phone (especially Nokia Maps and Drive). I highly recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for change in their smartphone.",14.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1780,B00A2V7ULY,Raj,5,20-Nov-12,False,Best Value phone,"Pros I have got the Lumia 920 yellow one. I was really impressed with the build quality and durability. The best part of this phone is the camera which took amazing pictures with different lens options. The screen is really awesome when I compared with my wife's iphone 5 this is massive and crystal clear. Maps and navigation don't require your data connection which saves our data quota drastically. This phone also has pretty good data compression, it consumes only 60% of your data compared to other phone consuming 100% for the same media content. Audio quality is top notch and this is the only phone which has Dolby Mobile with Free Nokia Music the phone has gone to the another level. Wireless charging is another feature which innovative and very useful forget about search for jack in the night just keep your phone on top of the plate it makes its wonders. My phone has two days of battery life with reasonable usage which I am really happy about. Same usage in my Nexus one and my wife's iPhone 5 lasts for one day. Note: Please disable background usage for Nokia drive to get two days battery backup. Cons 1. My Bose OE2i headphone mic wont work with this Lumia 920 - Its because different mic configuration only couple of Monster Headphones and headphone which are not mentioned as iPhone compatible would work in this phone. 2. As of now there are no much frequently used apps like Pandora, IMDB, Vonage..etc but I hope soon all of them might come to this platform. 3. Share to apps are not having social sites integration but there are ways to share. See my rating for this phone compared to iPhone 5 and latest Androids 1. Camera [10/10] 2.

I'm a long time iPhone and Android owner who's switching my app development from the iOS platform to the Windows platform. I was always fairly happy with my iPhone 4. Fragmentation on the Android platform was a nightmare so it pushed me to iPhone. But I have felt like Apple has been fairly stagnant since the 4 in terms of pushing the envelope. (That's not to say I was unahppy. I really like what Apple brings to the table). I now own both the 920 and the HTC 8X. The 920 is a phenomenal device. The screen, the camera, the Windows 8 OS - all far exceed my experience with Apple. The quality of hardware is unmatched on the market right now, in my opinion. The feel in your hand, the smooth interaction with the OS, all of these things make this phone and this platform the best on the market right now. The apps are coming. I've been developing apps for the iOS platform for years now. And I think developers see a gold rush and an untapped market with Windows Mobile now that they have some legitimate hardware in play.

1811,B00A7F57EM,aceoforder,5,20-Nov-12,False,"Absolutely beautiful, functional, fluid device","I manage mobile devices for a corporation in Rhode Island, USA and chose the Nokia Lumia 822 when we switched our account over to Verizon. I couldn't be happier. I previously had an HTC HD7 from T-Mobile, and here some some of my observations: - The AMOLED screen on this device is superb and quite possibly one of the best smartphone screens I've ever used. It is made of Gorilla Glass 2 and easily adjusts brightness to ambient light surroundings, keeping the colors sharp and bright whether in sunlight or in a dark room. Don't be turned off by the lower resolution of the 822 - it didn't make any sort of difference to me. Also, it is true that this screen features Nokia's high-sensitivity glass augmentation that allows it to be used with gloves. I can successfully choose music, tap on tiles, and even text without unnecessary effort. - Compared to my 1ghz HD7 running Windows Phone 7, this device is incredibly quick. WP7 was not a laggy operating system by any means, but the 1.5ghz dual-core in this device plus WP8 is a dramatic change. I have experienced absolutely no lag, whether I am switching apps, opening apps (the splash screens for most apps appear for less than a second, even with some video games). Alot of this is due to the OS itself: WP7 was built on Windows CE which had its own hardware and coding limits. WP8 shares the Windows 8 kernel for maximum hardware compatibility and optimization. I'll leave reviews of the actual Phone 8 OS to the rest of the Internet.... but it is elegant, beautiful, fast, capable, and very very under-appreciated in the marketplace.

1480,B00A2V7BA4,John Fieser,5,20-Nov-12,False,Nokia Lumia 920 is AWESOME!,"I just purchased this phone and it is by far the best phone I have ever owned. There are many reasons: 1) Love the physical specs and how it fits in my hand. The 920 is very sturdy, and at 6.5 ounces, I actually like the weight of it. Some folks say it is too heavy, but I think it is just right. 2) The Windows Phone 8 OS is fantastic. It allows for the most personalized home screen experience, much more than the IPhone or Android, which both seem cold in comparison. 3) Kids corner is great for folks with kids. It allows you to have a 'kids' section that allows them to play games, listen to music, whatever you decide to allow. As a parent of yound kids, this will be fantastic for long car rides. They can't get into any of your mail clients or send texts. 4) The camera is the best out there for smartphones, with an 8.7 megapixel Carl Zeis lens, with Pure View technology. Couple that with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 4.5 inch gorilla glass screen, the pictures and video are amazingly clear, especially in low light conditions. My kids play sports and it takes amazing action shots. 5) Dolby sound lets me listen to music in style. 6) Windows Phone 8 has plenty of apps, inclusing 46 of the top 50 best selling apps today on Android and IOS. 7) Too many others to mention:) I just love this phone!

20562,B07HD3QC65,Cameron Adams,3,20-May-19,True,Ok but with some annoyances and poor battery life,"I got this phone more to try out the new Nokia brand more than anything else. It's an OK phone but just that. The main issues I have with it are a really bad battery life. Basically 13 hours with 3 hours screen on time according to Gsam battery monitor pro. The fingerprint sensor is not responsive and can often take a few goes to work. I heard comments about the high quality case. Honestly it just feels light and plastic, not 'expensive' looking and not the quality I was expecting. A really big issue for me is with Google. They put an ""at a glance"" area at the top of the home screen along with a google search bar at the bottom of every screen. You cannot remove either short of installing a different launcher. I mean really google? It's my screen space and I want to have what I want there not your annoying things taking up MY real estate space. I guess the freedom of android customization is going away, google shall have what google wants. The USB C connector can also be a pain when you are set up for everything else micro USB, new cables, car chargers etc. or at least adapters if like me you can't live with just the single provided cable. In comparing this to my Huawei mate SE, it is simply not as good.

2353,B00CQAODG4,Poctor Doker,5,20-May-13,False,"Best phone I've owned. Make the switch, you won't regret it.","I had been waiting for this phone for 6 months, as ATT had an exclusivity contract with Nokia for the 920, and I must say that it was well worth the wait. This phone is fantastic all around. I can't tell you how many android and apple users have stopped me to comment on my phone, picked it up to play with, and sighed with regrets that they just renewed their contracts picking up a new Galaxy or iPhone. A brief breakdown by area: Hardware: Nice size and weight, not bulky or heavy despite some biased reviews out there, and is certainly lighter than the iPhone once its been ""Otterboxed."" Smooth and curved on the back for ease of holding, squared off on front. Easy to reach the whole screen with my thumb despite having small hands for a man. Wireless charging with the basic charging pad is quick and simple. Very satisfied to not have to struggle with micro-usbs anymore. Can't comment on durability because I haven't dropped it yet. Interace: Sleek, smooth, feels very high end and hi-tech, making the iPhone and Galaxy feel dated. Screen quality: Beautiful. Slightly dimmer than the iPhone at top brightness. Good visibility outside in sun. Battery Life: Pretty good, with heavy use you will likely need to recharge at least once daily. Apps: This is the big gripe point with WindowsPhones in general. There are fewer of thost ""must-have"" Apps, most notably instagram, dropbox, and personally for me HBOGO, however, these are the only Apps I find myself missing. There are decent 3rd party apps that can do the same. Lomogram for instagram, SkyDrive for dropbox. No 3rd party HBOGO app, but Netflix and Hulu are available. Pandora and Nokia music should keep you happy on the music end. Built in email interface is far more robust and streamlined than the android version...as a Gmail user I was very surprised by how much better Microsoft was able to manage Gmail than google based android. Facebook App is more than adequate. The App situation should improve substantially, particularly in light of the 928 now available on Verizon, and T-mobile getting their own flagship 925. Camera: Best available in the market. I have not picked up my Nikon DSLR because the shots I get off my 928 are comparable if not superior, particularly in low light. I took a photo this AM with family in pitch-black closet, and the quality is phenomenal with the xenon flash. Low light shots without flash are quite good as well. Very cool photo apps like SmartShot(takes rapid burst of pics and you pick the best one), panorama, and an animated-GIF app. Video: 1080P, better than real life quality. Can't do much better than this. Sound: On full volume(30/30), the sound can fill the room, although can be tinny at highest volumes).

This phone took forever to transfer information from one phone to the next even having a text savvy person doing it.

After transferring all my information that I needed to the new phone my memory was full mind you I have a additional storage card. Oh yeah the speed of the phone was like dial-up if you don't know what dial-up is just sit there for 5 minutes and do nothing because just accessing a message or anything on the phone would take forever!

However, since I have cursed this phone out at least 3 times per day since I started using it, I figure it’s time. First of all, I should have paid more attention to the “one star reviews” from actual victims....I mean users of this phone. I was too busy reading the good reviews of cheap phones from techies about the fabulous battery life and nice body of the phone. Durability. I completely ignored the innumerable warnings about how S L O W this phone is. I’m not ADHD or anything like that, but I am a senior citizen and I’d like to accomplish some things on this phone before I can’t remember how to. Like how to return to a call in progress if I hit any key on the phone with my face and wonder why the party I was conversing with hangs up saying “where did you go!” Or the good old days on my cheap $30 phone that lasted for years would light up when a message came in. Or waiting eternally for the home screen to come back so I can go on to something else I need to do. I have decided to give up and get another phone.

20673,B07HD3QC65,K. Burke,5,20-Dec-18,True,Best Android phone at this price point,"I am not someone who believes that spending $750-$1000 or more on a flagship smartphone is a good investment. Sure they're got the top specs, but they don't really do much that a budget phone like a Moto G6 doesn't do for a fraction of the price. That said, I was looking for something a little higher quality and better specced than an average budget device, so this Nokia caught my attention. And my experience has been that at this price point, I'm getting 90% of the experience of a flagship for 50% of the cost. That is a GREAT value. First, the pros/cons: PROS: - Build quality is FANTASTIC, this device looks and feels like a flagship quality device, and I am really stunned that they were able to accomplish this at this price point - Android One is what an OS should be; the device upgraded to Pie (9.0) right out of the box during the setup process, and I have had absolutely none of the problems previously reported with the OS. It is butter smooth and problem-free for me - Screen quality is very good, despite not being AMOLED. You will only notice that it's not AMOLED if you put it next to an AMOLED device and scrutinize it; in day-to-day use the screen is very crisp, and video/gaming looks great on it - Call quality on mine is noticeably better than it was on the G6; I can hear everyone clearly and others report that they can hear me more clearly - Signal strength (cell and wifi both) appears to be good in all of the areas that I've used it, which should be expected with a more recent SoC like the 636 - Performance is good despite what some other reviewers are saying, more on that below - US warranty - not to be overlooked when buying a new device - Size / form factor; this phone is the perfect size to me, with a good-sized screen yet easy to use one-handed CONS: - This device is VERY slippery. The glass design is beautiful, but it makes the device very slippery. I hate to cover up such a good-looking device with a case, but I'd rather do that than drop it - No wireless charging; more of a disappointment than a con, but the device doesn't do wireless charging despite the glass backing. It charges fairly fast with USB-C though - Other than the slipperiness and lack of wireless charging, I really haven't found any yet. I've been looking, too. MEH: - The battery is average in my experience. Not great, but not bad, and it gets me through the day with moderate use (a few calls, texting, some gaming). I'm typically getting home from work with over 50% battery remaining, which is good enough for me - Camera; for me so far this is average - again, not bad, not good. I am going to play around with the camera app some more, and maybe I can improve it some, but if the camera is super-important to you then you might want to look elsewhere, this implementation is just OK in my experience This is my first Nokia device, and I can say that I am tremendously impressed so far. I'm coming from a LG G6, and while that device may be more powerful on paper, in actual use this Nokia blows it away. Why? Well, mostly because of the software. Bad software can really put a damper on the parade even with a high-specced device, and this is the main reason that I was seeking a replacement for the G6. The skin/UI just ruins the experience, and I was looking for something that wouldn't have that problem. Android One will keep you updated for a minimum of two years, with security patches up to three years. But beyond that, it's a very light OS - this is how Android is supposed to run, and the Nokia 7.1 runs it very well. Navigation is buttery smooth, and I haven't encountered any stuttering or lag at all. I really can't overstate what a joy it is to use an Android One phone. You don't realize how much bad software is negatively affecting your experience until suddenly it isn't anymore. Which leads to performance. I've seen people complaining about that aspect, but I am not seeing anything at all to complain about. For starters, the Snapdragon 636 powering this device is obviously not going to be able to match an 845 device, but for a device that's half the price it's silly to expect that it would. That said, it performs very well in my experience. It easily outpaces my LG G6; that device has an older 821 that *should* still smoke the 636 on paper, but in real-world use it doesn't. Much of that is because of the OS / software, but it's also because the 636 is a newer SoC with a newer architecture. On my device it's clocked at 1.8 ghz on 4 cores, and 1.6 ghz on the other 4 cores, and while that sounds underwhelming, it's actually perfectly fine for nearly all applications. For example, I play Rise of Civilizations, which can get VERY laggy during battles, and I am experiencing noticeably less lag than I did with my G6. I've played some PUBG as well, and despite an occasional stutter it's easily playable on the Nokia 7.1. Shadowgun Legends runs buttery smooth with no lag or stuttering. If I can run those games well on this device, then that's good enough for me and a $349 price point.Given that and the ultra-smooth Android One experience, I see absolutely no reason to complain about performance about a phone at this price point. It's actually quite good for a mid-range SoC at this price. So where does this leave it vs the competition? In this price range, you've also got the LG G6, Moto X4, OnePlus 5/5T, Essential phone, Moto Z3 Play, and perhaps the Moto G6. For various reasons, I looked at all of these options and chose the Nokia because of its combination of build quality, modern SoC, size/form factor, price, and (most importantly to me) the Android One OS. Like I said, this was my first Nokia so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but so far this phone has blown me away. At this price point, I really don't think you can beat it.",10.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

The performance was so much better than his old LG. But in the last couple of weeks he has run into issues that are not insignificant. First off when charging this phone overnight it will shut itself down to the point that the power button alone will not turn it back on. It is necessary to use the power-volume up combo to get it to power back on. The first time that happened almost resulted in this phone being returned. Now it is constantly rebooting. Several times a day, in a seemingly random fashion. He has looked but can't find a firmware upgrade. This is terribly frustrating as it happens in the middle of doing things with the phone. What if he were on an emergency 911 call and this happened? So I am afraid that this phone will most likely be going back. It is a shame because we both thought that this would be a decent phone with Nokia's name on it. One day later...asked to return this unit. The above mentioned problems were bad enough. This morning the phone had lost all the accounts that had been stored on it. It came up looking like it had been set to factory refresh. That is it. I am through.

15327,B075FL4H89,Phred,1,20-Aug-18,True,The single worst battery powered anything I have ever owned,"It is not possible to believe that the Nokia TA-1036-C 3310 3G Factory Unlocked Phone is as bad as it is by mistake. The only possible reason for this phone is to wipe out any hope for a decent simple cell phone and thereby promote the sales of more expensive models. It may be that this is an ok emergency phone, but I am not that impressed with battery life. If this is your reason to own, make sure it is off and not just screen display off. The original Nokia 933 was one of the best cell phones ever made. Good battery life, even if you had occasional cell phone calls. The keyboard was the old 12 button type but the keys were reasonably large. Bottom line, it was a good phone. It did everything I wanted a cell to do and very little that I did not want a phone to do – and had good battery life. When I first read Nokia was reintroducing a 933 variant my thirst for this old beauty overcame my read of the cautionary reviews. My mistake. The screen: is slightly larger and has more pixels per inch. So what? It is still too small for any purpose. You get to see a tiny picture that may be what you thought you were aiming at, but until you move it to a larger screen it could be your shoe with a blob of paint next to it. Because the screen is slightly larger, the keys are proportionally smaller. The lettering on the keys are nearly invisible, esp in medium lighting. This is critical because the screen is unreadable in good lighting. Again because the keys are small it is very easy to hit things like the delete button unintentionally. OTOH it is very hard to delete, for example a message while you are reading it. In fact the overall organization of functions makes no obvious sense. Even the organization of the ‘aps” on the Ap view is counterproductive. The screen clicks off, locking the key pad fairly quickly even if you are a tad slow between keystroke. This can make it hard to copy or read information from the screen to another person or to a note pad. Butt Dialing OTOH the locked key pad automatically allows certain keys to be pressed. For example 911. Even if it takes you 10 hours to key in all three numbers the key pad will not go blank. It will also accept 191 and other like variations, but the idea is when you use the Nokia you have limited time before lock out, but your ‘191’ emergency can take 10 hours to unfold. You are always good to butt dial. Since the screen is too small for pictures: Why so much bloatware? Bloat ware that cannot be removed. Around the net there is some indication about ways to remove this bloat ware, but I think these are for earlier versions. Pretending you do want to fiddle with this … Stuff, not only is the screen small the internet connection is slow. 3 G . Tiny, slow loading pictures, what a fun way to shop/play/burn up battery life! Perhaps peculiar to my provider, the default settings for text messages do not allow the loading of any attachments. My provider was very patient with me first on line and then via phone, but I still cannot see attachments, .mms or anything of the like. I was very happy with my old flip phone and would be just as happy going back to one like it. As I see credit card companies, insurance companies and even state licenses going to phone displays over hard copy, I know I will eventually have to go the way of the oversized, over complicated only coincidentally a cell phone. Until then I will make sure everyone knows that the Nokia TA-1036-C 3310 3G Factory Unlocked Phone is terrible.",9.0,Nokia,Nokia 3310 3G - Unlocked Single SIM Feature Phone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 2.4 Inch Screen - Charcoal,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3310-3G-Unlocked-T-Mobile/dp/B075FL4H89,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iQ4QgMchL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FL4H89,497,54.99,59.0

15490,B075FLG6MV,Cameron Dollinger,1,2-Sep-18,True,"Slowest, most frustrating phone I have ever owned in my entire life.","Don't buy this. Seriously. You will regret it just like I currently am regretting owning this phone. Allow me to explain. The phone has less than 900 Mb of memory. This means it has difficulty running many apps with higher requirements. I literally can't download some regular apps that shouldn't be an issue for a phone, because those apps require a gig of RAM. 1 gig of RAM is not some hefty amount at this day and age. This phone cannot run multiple apps at the same time without 1 or more app crashing completely. Want to use spotify while you also have maps going on a drive? Nope, the phone closes 1 or the other because it can't handle both apps at once. Want to have maps running in the background? Nope, not with this phone. If you exit out and let it go in the background, it simply closes your map and directions. Want to show a friend something on youtube or send a snap with a cute filter to your significant other? HAHA! Joke's on you nerd! This phone takes a laughably long amount of time to even LOAD snapchat or youtube, and many times half way through a video or through applying some filter/sending a snap it will simply crash the application. This phone is infuriating. I honestly have to fight the urge to throw it across the room into a wall every day. The only upside to this phone is the low price tag, but the low price tag makes sense when you realize you are paying for a piece of trash phone that should be sold for 50 dollars, not even 100.

14155,B071ZDQ6MV,dan,5,2-Sep-17,True,Fantastic Premium Smartphone at value price.,"I bought mine in silver with the clear plastic cover. It looks like an $850 iPhone with great screen,beating iPhone 6 in display by some pro reviewers and loads apps faster. It is the perfect size, big but not painful with my smaller hands. The phone works great in my area and speaker is loud. Outdoor viewing in great, just take off auto adjusting screen settings. Not loaded up bloatware and if you keep an eye on open apps the speed is good enough as with all Android phones. Too many open apps slow down phones. I loaded Nokia Z launcher and a few other apps to keep it simple and professional looking. I like how Z launcher handles the looks of widgets. All and all, you can't ask for a better looking phone for this price and it was a coin flip between silver and copper. The phones overall quality is excellent and I have no regrets picking this over my other choice, Moto G5 plus. If you want a great looking phone comparable to iPhones, this is it. Great pictures also, just as with all phones, picture quality is dictated by if you hold your phone still. That's why pro's use tripods and seriously don't use flash. Nokia made me a happy customer. Update: Sept.10, I think Nokia updated the camera software because these pictures are much better, sharper and more color.

13963,B071ZDQ6MV,Tony Flores,4,2-Sep-17,True,Possibly the best phone NEW at this price point.,"How did I end up picking the Nokia 6? Well it was never my first choice. I've been using a Sharp Aquos crystal for almost three years. I've watched the flagship phones come and go, and nothing made me want to jump. Until now that is. With the Mi Mix 1 and 2 ready to drop, the LG V30, Sharp S2, Meizu 7 I've been itching to move up and get something really nice. My Crystal phone had other plans. It died, so I planned on getting another budget/midrange type phone to hold me over for work until I get a flagship type device. About 250 was the max. Yes I could have gone with a LG G6 used, V20 etc. But for one reason or another I passed. Nokia ticked most of the boxes at the right price. I've had the phone exactly one week. Thanks Amazon for the free ONE day shipping! So I'll start with a list of pros and cons. Keep in mind I'm coming from cheap phone and giving pros and cons based on the price of 229 US dollars. PROS: 1. Milled from a solid piece of aluminum. Love the sound when I set it down on a glass table or tile counter. 2. good screen size at 5.5 inches, decent blacks, usually good color (more on that later) 3. Single speaker, but it sounds good and sounds full and deep for such a tiny thing. 4. Call quality is good 5. reception is good over cellular and wifi 6. Android 7, stock so virtually no bloat. 7. Dual sim, but only one sim if you choose to add a memory card. 8. Camera is pretty good at this price point, but can't hang with a flagship. 9. Still has a headphone jack. 10 LED light is pretty strong and color temp is on the warm side. 11. Good battery life. Not great but good. CONS: Or why no five stars 1. No indicator LEDs for notifications or charging. LAME! 99 dollar android phones have this. 2. No USB-C still the old micro USB. Not a huge deal at this price, but still. 3 sleep/wake button is RIGHT next to volume up/down. Guess what I keep hitting when I try to lower the volume? You get one guess. Stupid. 4. Morons at HMD/Nokia decided to curve the glass just enough so glass protectors won't work right. This sucks. Film type protector installed for now. 5. Great screen, brightness, and color when displaying pure primary colors, but whites and certain colors have an annoying green/blue cast issue. Orange-y type sunset photos sometimes have that pee yellow look, not good. 6. Those bezels! Come on phone makers, you can do better. This phone has a sweet rear with face only a mother could love. The face is very 2012. Some general thoughts. I don't mention chipsets, or gaming because I'm not a nerd looking for high end gaming from a phone. I can use a proper desktop or game console for that. I also don't watch movies or TV shows on my phone. It's the occasional phone call, text, and social media and web surfing a little boom beach and music with my ear buds from time to time. My old cheap phone did all that just fine so I don't get too caught up in phone specs. Moving on. I knew about the lack of LED indicators for charging/notifications, still have to blast Nokia for this stupid move. The Chinese version of the Nokia 6 has this. Trying to save pennies here is just plain mind boggling. My next gripe is the curved glass. Another dumb move. It's not curved in such way that they did it for style, because you can't really tell it's curved. Try to put a flat glass protector on there and it's just a disaster. Haven't found a pure glass curved protector for this phone yet. Installed a film type protector for now. I like the navigation buttons are off screen and illuminated, I hate the virtual screen ones that steal screen real estate. Phone screens are small and I need every square inch. The camera sensor and lens are pretty good. Even low light is decent at this price point. It's snappy, and focus is pretty quick. The LED ""flash"" isn't the best. it's a dual tone style, but rarely gets the color right. Video is nice, but nothing to write home about. BOTTOM LINE: Even with all my gripes this phone should be on your list of budget/midrange phones. The fit and finish is great, call quality is solid, the speaker is good with decent camera as well. 32GB is decent too. After installing the apps I had on my old phone and a few more I have 14GB left. Keep in mind I don't have many photos, and only some test videos. And best of all it's not a Galaxy or iPhone. Sorry but can't rock a phone everyone has. If only HMD/Nokia would remember the greatest phone ever made, the mighty Nokia N9. That phone that did things some phones can't do now, and that many other phone makers copied features from. Where is the N10? Sorry the Nokia 8 ain't it.... On an off topic.. if Nokia made a flagship that was inspired by the N9 I'd buy it, no I would pre-order it. Photo attached was taken by me on day one with a FujiX100 before any case or screen protector business.

I have enjoyed using the android and Apple systems, but in my opinion the 928/window 8 OS takes it to the next level of function and ease of use. An overview includes: 1. The new Windows 8 OS is intuitive, well presented visually and very easy to use. My favorite yet. 2. The app's that I have used in the past are available in Windows 8, so I do not see either Android or Apple having any real advantage. The Nokia app's for photo, maps and music are actually top notch, unlike most of the bloat that comes under most suppliers branding. 3. The camera is a standout feature of this unit. Coupled with the photo programs available through Windows 8, this is a true ""takeover"" camera for all but the better SLR's. 4. My battery life has been over 24 hours with moderate use 5. The signal pick up of the Wi-Fi has been a pleasant surprise. Areas of poor reception on my Android and Apple handsets come through with solid signals and amazingly fast performance. Nice! 6. I live in a poor reception area for Verizon and would see one bar or 3g a lot, especially with my Apple. Not so with the 928. For the first time with a smart handset, I have great clarity throughout the house. 7. The screen clarity is also an impressive. At least on par with my Apple 5 and with it's slightly larger size, it's a nice improvement. 8. Self set up through Amazon was a 5 minute, painless affair.

At the beginning, I thought it was awesome. I particularly liked having a windows platform as I had had an apple iphone, so it was very nice having MS Office always in my hand. However, I have a few issues with the device itself. First off, it always drops calls (I know everyone says that is due to carrier, but I could always get clear calls at home, work, and school.) even though it has full bars. Second, the call quality is very poor when you do get through. My boss and coworkers complain that they have trouble hearing me (hence, the fat check I am about to write to get a better quality phone mid-contract). Third, it freezes 1-2 times per week (I am not a heavy user. No games, but text, phone, email, and internet). Fourth, headphone jack is very poor quality. It stopped working, the housing started to break. Fifth, picture quality is terrible. While I understand that a cell phone won't have great pictures, anything larger than viewing on the phone itself it is grainy and fuzzy.

Things I like: the round keys make txting incrementally a better experience, incremental improvements are huge! I like that messaging is in a conversation view, its great to be able to easily scroll through previous conversations. The txt memory is huge, it took two weeks until I had to delete txt's to make room for new ones. My previous phone was every other day (what a chore!). This phone is fashionable, people see it and compliment it. I like that I can make phone calls again (my previous phone stopped working except for speaker). I use the calculator, calendar and speed dial and contacts most, this phone has them all. And they work just fine (hard to screw that one up). I love that this phone has a flashlight, thats new to my world! I also like the FM radio, though I wish it worked without headphones. I can't stand headphones, I want to listen to the radio out loud. Downsides, are kinda big. This phone does not support group MMS messaging. This is taken for granted in this day and age, thats such a big deal that I may go back to my old phone that only works on speaker phone. Txt is more important than voice calls anymore. I can send photos and receive MMS, but only sort of. I receive photos and some MMS messages, but others I can't see at all! It gets old telling everyone I don't receive MMS very well or group conversations at all. I wish the directions (left, right, up, down) key was bigger. Its razor then and I slip off it too often.

1755,B00A2V7BA4,ME Wilson,1,2-Mar-13,False,Not worth it! Get something else!!!,"Too many issues! First, it scratched immediately! I had my Droid 2 for *two* years before I got a scratch on it! I've been more careful with the 920 but it has multiple scratches from careful handling- poor!!! I have other devices with ""gorilla glass"" and they haven't scratched. Nokia's gorilla glass is sub standard! No apps! Bing Maps is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! Worse than useless!!! Volume in calls and speaker phone- too low! Cannot set specific volume for incoming call ring, incoming call volume, or notifications, etc. How hard is this? I don't want every text notification super loud but I don't want to have to turn up the volume each time someone calls. Can't set your own notification sounds. And at first you couldn't even hear the ring tones or notifications tones to choose the sound! No cursor while typing. You have to retype the whole word! And since it adds a 'b' everytime the space bar is hit, that is a PAIN!!! Battery randomly just completely exhausts itself. Same environment day& useage after day, one day the phone is 50% by 5pm, next day dead. No predictability! No good warning the phone is low either! The phone is slippery! It tries to slide out of pockets! I've caught it but one day it will fall... wonder if it will survive that and how many scratches the ""gorilla"" glass will have then.... Won't turn sidewise for larger keyboard in many apps like Facebook. Syncs poorly with email. To avoid data issues I have to choose the sync every 15min instead of constant and it doesn't even keep all my email on the phone. If I want to go to a folder, I have to download that specific folder! Really? Why don't I have acces to my email like I did with Blackberry and Droid?? If I'm typing an email, text, or Facebook post and the phone goes to sleep, the text typed is lost :( Did I mention the no apps?? Seriously, no good shopping list, can't use Google maps, the Calendar app is weak with minimal ability to adjust events no ability for multiple reminders. Sure, they have their own Cloud but I don't want everything on the Cloud. I want things on my phone where I have quicker acces and don't pay more data useage fees. Shame on AT&T for making the phone function to increase data useage!!! Way to screw your customer. I also don't care who owns Google, Bing or whatever. I've had a gmail account for years. So have many people. All phone companies should make thier phones work well with standard emails such as gmail, hotmail... I want to access Drive easily as well. I do not want to have to switch to a new provider each time I get a new phone, or stick to one brand of phone. The propietary stuff is ridiculous, antiquated and serves no customer. Get with the program and make phones that are work for customers and don't try to lock people into one thing. All in all- this phone is *NOT* ready for Prime Time and a severe disappointment. It's 2months old, and looks like 2yrs old with hard use. Since there are no apps and so many problems/bugs, it spends more time sitting quietly than any other phone I've had so how does it look so bad so quickly.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

The Nokia Lumia 928 from Verizon is UNLOCKED by default. You DO NOT need to purchase a plan to use this unlocked device. Not only have various websites confirmed this, but I purchased the White Lumia 928 from my local Version store at full price, off contract, on May 27, 2013. I'm currently using my AT&T SIM card in this phone. No unlock code is required unlike the Lumia 920, which I had as well, to use other carriers like T-Mobile. The reason for this post and the 1 Star rating is due to Verizon and possibly Nokia blocking the usage of other carriers networks' Access Point Names, or APNs, other than Verizon's. APNs are specified carrier configurations to use network data and send/receive MMS or picture messages. I can make/receive calls and text message, but can't surf the web or send pics. Nokia released an App in the Windows Phone Store called ""Access Point"" enables you to easily manage individual operator settings for internet, MMS and internet sharing features. http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/access-point/ce3895c7-01d0-4daf-a4c3-25c10463942d This app works on every Lumia device except for the Lumia 928.

The only complaint my wife has is when she first got the phone it was perfect for her in every way then the Android 9 update came through. Initially, following the update, she could no longer sync the Fitbit One to the phone. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure this out and did come up with a work-around... Plug the Fitbit One into the charger and then press and hold the function select button on the Fitbit for 10 seconds to put the Fitbit into a reset condition. After that, the Fitbit will sync with the Nokia 7.1 phone one time. To sync again, the above procedure must be repeated. Keep in mind that syncing was not an issue prior to the update. Hopefully this issue will be fixed in some future update but for now it is what it is. Even though this sync issue exists, all the phones other functions work great and it takes very nice pictures. Would definitely purchase this phone again. Note: This phone is supper slippery. You will need a protective phone cover to provide some texture so the phone doesn't slip out of your hand.

I am a T-mobile user and have used this phone for two months, which would be not enough to review its battery life or any other durability issues. Anyway, I have been very satisfied. The phone works fine at T-mobile LTE bands, and also would have a good band coverage for international trips. I have traveled to some East Asian and Europian countries where popular LTE bands are slightly different from US. The phone covers some of the major 3G or LTE bands in both regions, and I could use them without any problem for Roaming or local prepaid SIM cards, although you MUST check bands by yourself for your travel(s). Dual SIM capabilities and many up-to-date features associated with the latest native Andoroid has been really helpful in both daily life and business as well as during international travels.

1504,B00A2V7BA4,Nathaniel H Hill,5,2-Dec-12,False,So far so good,"I recently picked up a Nokia Lumia 920... I'm extremely impressed. For me the choice was WP8 with the iPhone as a back-up if I didn't like this phone - I'm tired of Android, well at least Samsung's Android phones. The main things I considered before buying this phone was the camera and NFC - the latter more for work since we're playing around with NFC tags (so by default the iPhone wasn't included but I'd still prefer that over Android). The camera rocks and the filters are very cool. Nokia is still working on updating a few WP7 programs but I'm having a great time with the apps currently available. My wife, who has an iPhone, is constantly peeking at my Lumia as well as borrowing it to surf the web. While she likes the Lumia 920 and thinks it is a better phone overall she's still very happy that she has the iPhone due to the 4s' size - both the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 are too tall for her. Additionally, the apps available for the iPhone, that she uses (medical related) aren't available for WP8 so I wouldn't dream of trying to convert her even if the Lumia was the right size for her. So all in all, I'm extremely happy with my decision to get the Lumia 920 and I'm already looking forward to the next Lumia flagship that includes a larger sensor in addition to the image stabilization :-) If you're looking for a phone that takes really good pictures then this is it. By the way, I guess it's worth mentioning a possible downside. I say possible before it's not a bad thing for some people but for me it is. I actually don't like the matte feel because it's slippery to me. I love the look of black matte. In fact as far as artwork goes the Lumia 920 is probably one of my favorite pieces but I probably will exchange it for the shiny white gloss Lumia. For whatever reason I have better grip when I hold the shiny gloss versions of the Lumia 920. Plus the white version looks even better in the 'high contrast mode' :-) Anyways I'm glad to see all the positive reviews for the Lumia 920. I'm happy we switched from Sprint to AT&T - the early termination fees were worth it. UPDATE Feb. 16th I'm still really happy about my purchase. I love my phone. Just wanted to add that the customer service from Nokia is amazing. The grip on my phone was something that I worried about. Nokia ended up sending me a really great case to help with the grip that also does a great job of protecting the phone. Needless to say I was extremely impressed with their commitment to their phones and providing a great customer experience as well as the speed in which they responded. So just wanted to add my two cents - you're not only getting an amazing phone but you're also getting a great customer service experience from Nokia as well.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1813,B00A7F57EM,J. Rothwell,5,2-Dec-12,False,Beautiful and Innovative Phone,"Basaed on reviews and confidence in Nokia, I switched from a Motorolla Droid 2 Global, which I liked, to the Nokia Lumia 822. Here are some of the main reasons why I am delighted with that decision after having a chance to use the phone: The Lumia 822 camera is excellent; the video and photos are clearer and the lighting more natural than the droid's camera and any smartphone I've seen. The Lumia music features are amazing. Not only can you sink all of you ITunes material with the Lumia device, Nokia provides a free no-add Pandora-like service. Moreover, I've downloaded an app ""Amazing Music,"" which allows you to stream and store quick links to entire albums. Nokia/Lumia's driving and mapping services are rated as the world's best. Though I haven't taken a road trip yet, I tested it with my commute to work, which involves walking and taking the metro: It was incredibly accurate and even told me the stops in between the one I needed. The homepage is incredible. The Windows operating system lets you customize the location and prominence of your apps, and let's you pick a few for live constant updates. For example, when you ""pin"" your contact to the front page (or further down), you see his or her facebook, twitter, or linked-in updates displayed overtop the app. So, you don't even need to log into Facebook to see what your closest friends and family are posting. Indeed, the Facebook and twitter synching is the best I've ever seen. It takes seconds to take a photo, post it on Facebook, and tag your friends. It even remembers your recently used tags. It also shows pictures you were tagged in as a banner as you scroll and read upadates, which you can change if you want. Another plus is that Microsoft office is readily available, so you can edit Word documents and Excel documents, which is very useful for work. It also has a family room app that allows you to sink to-do lists, grocery lists, and anything else across phones and accounts with anyone who has a facebook, hotmail, or MSN account, or wants to create one for free. The keyboard is my only complaint, since I have big thumbs. I moved from the slideout QWERTY from Motorolla to the Iphone-like keyboard here. Still, it is larger, I believe, than the iphone board when you turn it sideways (it has a very wide screen), and the word suggestion tool is very good. I'm getting better at. The app store is a minor issue too, as developers are still getting use to Microsoft's new and impressive operating system (Windows 8). Yet, there are many excellent apps, and almost all of the apps I used with Google's operating system are available (and often look even better), including: Public transit trip planners, Gmail, white noise, chess, YouTube, a photo editor, Wikipedia, Facebook, a flashlight, bike share services, weather channel, a public parking payment app, and The New York Times. For gamers, there are an increible number of options, including Xbox compatibility, but I don't play games other than chess. Overall, these issues are minor. The best part of the phone is its elegance and beauty. The image, picture, and video quality are the best I've ever seen, and the tile colors can be easily changed to your mood or preferences. The conversation and sound quality is also superb. It is easily one of the best phones on the market and is roughly half the price. I highly recommend it.",24.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 822 16GB Windows Phone Black - Verizon,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Windows-Phone-Black/dp/B00A7F57EM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxGoYUWTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A7F57EM,62,204.16,0.0

Torres,4,2-Dec-12,False,"Great phone, new features are really great.","I am a happy Nokia Lumia 900 phone user and I am so happy to finally get the Nokia Lumia 920 (Yellow) WP8 device. Happy to see the tiles are now customizable. Fell in-love with Lumia 900's camera specially when taking videos and photos and guess what? Lumia 920 never fails me at all. We now have an option to shoot videos at 1080p (default is 720p) it will auto detect and turns the light on in low-light yes, during video recording. Aside from the tap and share photos we can now use the Nokia maps to share locations (for HTC WP8 users bing maps has this feature too). I also like the new Family Room feature where you can invite facebook friends/relatives or other person you want to add from your contact list so you can track events and recent activities of the people you know and care :) If you have kids definitely turn on the Kid's corner so you can let your kids play your phone and not mess with it. I have posted some videos on my you tube channel (teknowsit) if you want to check Nokia Lumia's 900 video on Richard Marx's recent Seattle concert. I will soon upload my videos from my Lumia 920's for future reference. WP8-PC connection is also easy now and doesn't need the Zune software. Phone explorer enables you to copy to-from PC-phone so saving/sharing stuff is now easy. You can also make use of the skydrive to keep your devices in-sync. Login to Windowsphone . com and go to Purchase History and you can re-install your apps to your device.

1175,B00836Y6B2,EightInTheNest,3,2-Dec-12,False,Not impressed with the camera!,"I was a devoted Blackberry user for the last 5 years. When the Windows phone came out I was interested, and when I won one I was thrilled! Now that I've had the chance to play with and use the Nokia 900 here are my thoughts. First, wow. This is supposed to be THE camera for those who want great pictures. YEAH RIGHT. Nearly all of my pictures turn out blurry, and if I zoom in...OH.MY.GOSH. They are truly terrible. Pixelated and just horrid. This is most definitely NOT what I expected from this phone's camera! Another huge downfall for me is the inability to choose which album my photos go to when I share them to Facebook. This is a developer issue, I believe, not necessarily the phone's issue (but maybe it is?), but it is a BIG deal to me. I don't want photos to just go to my ""mobile uploads"". I miss my speed-dial option. I used to have a set key to call my house and my husband's cell phone, I am unable to do this with the 900. :( I also found it too easy to change the sound for the ringtone and in-call while in your pocket (or purse) or while you are actually talking/using the phone. Another thing I dislike is the ability to change the calendar view permanently. I prefer month view, but you cannot get month view to stay on your calendar settings, only daily view and then you have to touch to see the month view. A minor annoyance, but still very cumbersome to me. The battery life is unimpressive. With minor use I go through my battery in less than 10 hours. I need a battery that lasts longer. Even with the battery saver turning on it doesn't do enough. Also, if you prefer to have a light background vs the dark background you will go through your battery even faster. Have a car charger available! Another HUGE thing is the inability to select text. I often want to copy text that is in an email and I am unable to do this with the Lumia 900. Huge disappointment and another reason I miss Blackberry. :/ Things I do like... I like the Windows OS. I like the Windows 8 OS better than this 7.5 Mango, but it's not all that bad. I like the ability to have multiple alarms. I like the screen, it's large and beautiful. The touch screen is pretty accurate, and I was able to transfer from the actual qwerty keyboard to the virtual one fairly easily ( I was very tentative of this). The apps that are available are great, there are plenty of free apps that are great to have. I love that I can watch Netflix on this device! I am looking forward to trying the 920 and I am hoping some of these issues have been resolved...but for the Lumia 900 all I can say is it's ""okay"".",1.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0

Now, I have to plug in the phone several times per day - The UI freezes several times per week - The phone struggles to maintain accurate information from compatible Nokia bluetooth products including the Withings smart watches. Data is inaccurate and syncing is often delayed This was nothing like the Nokia phones I enjoyed a decade ago.

This is a business phone, I cannot afford to be without the phone for even a single day. Their solution is to send it in for repair and be out for several days or more. I would like a Credit Card backed exchange but this offer is not available. Now I have to get a backup phone to cover the down time. Nokia is trying to be a major contender in the phone market again, this in not the way to get there. Love the phone but the warranty support need a lot of work.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0
22330,B07N11SM58,Garett R.,1,2-Apr-19,True,Buyer beware! This is likely NOT worth the hassle to you.,"The Good: Amazing outdoor photos with good lighting conditions in the day time when the camera works. The Bad: Literally about every other thing about this phone/camera. So I have used this phone since its launch, the honeymoon period is over, and it is absolutely deplorable for the money. At first I was impressed by the camera, until you hit the harsh 40% battery life brick wall. Once you get to 40% battery and below, the camera constantly freezes, or kicks you out immediately upon opening the camera. I have even had a few times where the camera completely locks me out from being able to open it, saying that the phone cannot connect to the camera. On top of this, moving subjects are near impossible to get a decent shot of. Another catch is that when the camera does work, it takes AMAZING outdoor pictures, however indoors is a different story, and it is a sad story most of the time. My wife recently bought a Xiaomi A2 and it takes consistently better and faster pictures indoors, and that phone is only $200. Then there is the unbearable touch-screen based finger print reader, which is already the worst on the market, but then when you add a screen protector on the phone, it will no longer function at all. But wait, there's more! This phone features a slow-motion video mode, which has a built in little editor that lets you adjust what parts you want to be slow motion and what parts you don't, however you cannot actually save this and if you try to upload the video, share the video, or do anything with the video outside of the phone, the video will only upload as a fully slow motion video. So far, if this sounds pretty bad, just know it gets worse. You will experience other random bugs that may include but are not limited to: the flashlight function will disable itself until you reboot the phone, the phone glitches when it rings and it makes an incredibly loud distorted sound instead of your ringtone, the alarm volume will randomly turn itself off so your alarm may not have any volume (not very helpful), random other apps crashing consistently, Instagram and Facebook not being able to load your pictures and instead crashing/freezing the app, and more. Nokia's response to these issues that has plagued nearly every other owner as well is that they are ""working on an update"" and that they ""hope that the update will fix these issues."" Keep in mind, this phone received an update immediately after release and it did not seem to fix any of these major issues. This phone is also a ""limited edition"" phone, meaning once they sell out of their inventory they no longer will be making this phone. If you think support is bad now, I can only imagine the support a year from now for a phone they no longer make and only made a limited run of. Unless if you just have a bunch of money to spend on ""something different"" and are wanting to avoid the Galaxy/iPhone grind, your money is best saved for something better (if you are looking for a solid camera on your phone, seach up ""DxOMark""). I made the mistake of selling my DSLR (Canon T5i) because I thought that this phone would be an adequate substitute without having to lug around a camera and being ""that guy"" with the camera all the time, now I am just a guy who is frustrated that his phone can't event take pictures half the time.",39.0,Nokia,"Nokia 9 PureView - Android 9.0 Pie - 128 GB - Single Sim Unlocked Smartphone (at&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/H2O) - 5.99"" QHD+ Screen - Qi Wireless Charging - Midnight Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-PureView-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07N11SM58,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ls1kpJJsL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N11SM58,61,499.99,699.0

3611,B00HWEMZ1E,AD,4,2-Apr-14,False,Satisfied,"I've owned this phone for a month. This is a great phone. The OS feels fresh and modern. The hardware is high quality, very classy and elegant. I have experience with the competition as well. I have an iPhone 5 for work (company provided). The Icon is my personal device. Upgraded from a samsung S4. Pros: -Never stutters, freezes or crashes. Rock solid OS. Haven't restarted it once. -Well made handset. Feels solid. Looks great. I love the beveled glass. -Nokia apps! Their maps and nav apps alone are the best I've used. -Live tiles, and GUI. I much prefer this OS over the other two. It just feels ""right"". The others seem outdated and sluggish. IMO this is the biggest pro, as the actual power of the other high end phones are slightly worse or slightly better than this phone. It's all about the experience. -Camera is insanely good. I've never been able to print phone pics before because they're too grainy. Not the case with the icon. -OneNote. Awesome note taking app from MS. Cons: -Internet explorer stinks. No back button usage if you wake the app up from the tile. Works if you open it from the task manager. -App store is a hellhole. The apps are supposed to be screened and approved by MS. MS needs better screening. All the apps I need are there and then some. But the store is cluttered with junk apps and nonsense. -Some Third party apps are not as good here as they are on other phones. Not matured is a good word. But usable. -Google and microsoft hate eachother. Therefore google doesn't develop for WP...yet. -Battery. I list this as a con because my iphone can last days without juice.

1478,B00A2V7BA4,spontaneity,5,2-Apr-13,False,I miss my Bumble Bee!!!,"With great pain and disappointment, I have to announce that I dropped my little Bumble Bee (yes, I have a yellow Lumia) and the screen is completely shattered. After frantically searching for a possible explanation why this Nokia is not like my Nokia I had 10 years ago, the one that I dropped times and times again but IS still working like a trooper, I have to come to terms with the fact that the screen is glass, no matter what kind of glass it will break if you are unlucky. I have to admit that I was fairly disappointed at first and there was this thought that I should probably search for a new phone because I'm so afraid this shattered screen will not be my first and only one. I still have my old iPhone 4 that I can use while waiting for my Bee to get fixed and see if I could switch back. That's when I realized I cannot live without my Lumia. It's almost like I took things for granted before, my life was so much easier then. The things that I miss: 1. The gorgeous and super sensitive screen. 2. The weight. I know this is a turn off for most but for me, I love the weight in my hands, iPhone is just way to light. Also, this phone can totally be a weapon if needed. :D 3. The navigation of the apps. It's so easy to find my most used apps with the re-sizable titles. 4. The back button. I can't count how many times in the last few days I keep touching the bottom left of my iPhone to go back to the screen before and then realized it wasn't there and it won't be, ever. 5. The camera. I won't say more, this has been over-discussed in many places. 6. The vibrant color that makes a statement wherever I go. 7. Nokia Drive. This GPS is so awesome it actually tells you the street names and highway names and exit numbers and in many different languages. 8. The fact that I can see how many emails and messages I have without having to unlock my phone. 9. Many other little things that I don't remember. I know that there is still a lot of room for improvements in many areas (apps store is first on the list) but it is the best phone for me and I can't wait to hold it again.

20675,B07HD3QC65,Raul,5,19-Nov-18,True,Great midrange phone of 2018! now with Android 9!,"UPDATE (Nov 28, 2018) ANDROID 9 PIE I just got the software update notice to Android 9 (Pie), so now I'm running the latest OS with latest security updates. The new OS, runs just as fast as Android 8. In the update process I had an issue, I had to contact Nokia costumer support to resolve it, here is the explanation and the solution if it helps: After getting the Android 9 update notice, the phone downloaded the new OS update (1305 MB size), after that I restarted the phone, that's when the display turned off and the phone wouldn't turn on again, I contacted Nokia customer support, and they told me to do a soft-reset, to do that, you have to press at the same time the power + volume up buttons for 10 seconds until the phone restarts, that did the trick, phone started as normal and finished the Android 9 updated. UPDATE (Nov 27, 2018) After using the phone for the last couple of weeks, I want to address some features about the display and camera that I didn't write about in my original review that I think are important: DISPLAY The quality of the display is outstanding, the HDR feature really makes the colors pop from the screen. Also the aspect ratio of 19:9 (1080x2280 pixels) is really useful in social apps like whatsapp and facebook, because it allows you to see a lot of content. CAMERA I like the detail of the photos, the setting ""Auto HDR"" is on by default and improves the contrast, you can get a little sharper images by turning off this feature, but I leave it on, as I like the overall image clarity. Portrait mode reveals some nice shots with bokeh effect. ORIGINAL REVIEW (Nov 19, 2018) I was looking to replace a 3 year old phone, I did my research and reduced my list to the following midrange phones: - Moto One - Moto G6 Plus - Sony Xperia XA2 - Samsung Galaxy A6 - Nokia 7.1 After comparing the specs and features of the phones in above list, I finally settled for the Nokia 7.1 for the following reasons: OUTSTANDING SPECS: Comes with the powerful Snapdragon 636, this is a recent mobile processor that offers great performance. It's snappy, loads apps fast, I haven't experienced any slow downs like other reviewers have said. It comes with 4GB of RAM, that's plenty enough for current and future apps. And finally 64GB of internal storage, that you can expand to 400GB with a micro SD, I have already bought a Samsung 64GB EVO micro SD card for $10, efectively expanding storage to 128GB. The battery has a capacity of 3060 mAh battery (like most phones these days), and comes with a large charger that enables Qualcomm's quick charging feature. SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE: This phone comes with Android One, meaning it is a pure Android OS, without the bloatware that other phones come plagued with from the factory. With Android One, you get security updates for the following two years. This phone comes loaded with Oreo 8.1.0. Android 9 (Pie) is in the works, Nokia is supposed to release it soon. BEAUTIFUL DESIGN: The phone feels really solid in your hand, and you can feel the quality, the edges of the phone resemble a high end phone. I really like the design. I got the blue color, but I think the gray color looks really good too. And I agree with every one in here, you should definitely get a rugged protective case, because the phone is really slippery, I guess this is the price you have to pay for getting all glass design. LTE NETWORK I did my research, you should check the bhphotovideo web site, for network compatibility in your country/operator, mine displays correctly LTE next to the network signal status, so for those that show 4G instead, I think it depends on your telecom operator, not the phone itself. That's all for now, I will try to update this review in a few weeks.",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

1604,B00A2V7BA4,funktion,3,19-Nov-12,False,"Good phone, but shortcomings in maps and music apps","While most critiques about the Lumia 920 keep talking ad nauseum about the size, weight and lack of apps, I wonder how many of these reviewers are actually spending time with the phone to see how it adds value in everyday situations. For example, I use my phone primarily to find my way around town, and for listening to a lot of music. I think the Lumia 920 is the most high quality and gorgeous looking mobile device ever made, and I actually love the size and weight -- it's a joy to hold and use. That said, I found the Windows Phone 8 OS lacking in features I've so far taken for granted on other phones. For me, the following inadequacies mar what could otherwise be a great phone, 1) Nokia Maps needs to have more data and be more polymorphic. I could type the name of a place in the ""To:"" field in Google Maps, and it will most likely find the place and give me directions. This is not the case on the Windows Phone. For example, in San Francisco, try typing ""The Sycamore"" (a popular bar in the Mission District). 2) Nokia Maps mustn't be a world unto itself. When I click on an address in an E-mail, I'm not sure why it opens in ""Windows Maps"". This is far inferior to Nokia Maps (it has no public transit directions), and I have no way of changing the default application to open addresses. 3) Nokia Maps and Transit must be consolidated -- accessing two different apps to find directions makes no sense at all. 4) Nokia Maps (or Navigator) must provide an option to access alternate routes. We're given only one route for driving (or walking) but I'm sure a lot of the time, the user wants to use an alternate freeway (or road). 5) Xbox Music is very unimpressive as a native music player. There's no way to rewind/forward elegantly (a slider here would be great, I can't go back to holding down buttons!). The Nokia Music app doesn't even have rewind/forward capability. 6) Given that the Lumia has a gorgeous big screen, it's a pity that I can't see my album art in full screen -- in the player, or when my screen is locked. Apparently the album art only loads on the lock screen if you buy the songs from XBox music. It doesn't work even if you update the album art in Windows Media player. 7) The music streaming options are very limited for the Windows Phone 8. SkyMusic and SkyDrive are quite lacking when compared to Amazon Cloud player or Google Play. SkyDrive doesn't even run as a background app, and stops playing music when you go back to the home screen!",20.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1486,B00A2V7BA4,mb,5,19-Nov-12,False,Impressive,"Just upgraded from Iphone this weekend to Lumia 920. This phone is really impressive. Features are smart and user friendly. Windows 8 live tiles are a fresh update to the icons we have become used to on iphone and all imitators. Tiles allow you design your own icons with live information. The apps I have downloaded so far are excellent. I have found several apps on this phone to be superior in function and with better features compared to similar apps I have always used on iphone. Nokia app ""transfer my data"" took a couple minutes to download all contacts from my iphone to the lumia despite AT&T saying this was not possible. Some may hesitate to purchase Windows phone because there are less overall apps available compared to iphone and android. I would highly advise to look at the quality of apps and what apps you actually use. Can't imagine there is much if anything you would really want that is not available. Camera is also great as advertised. Pictures in low light come out great. There is a Nokia panorama app available for those who care. Nokia music service also awesome particularly for those liking Pandora. You can download playlists of your choice for offline use so you do not need wifi or 4G to listen to music. Music service is also free. General features like setting up e-mail, contacts, blue tooth including car hook up are all so smooth and do not require any help to setup. Speed on 4G LTE for those who have not used yet is ridiculous when downloading. These are just early impressions since only using a few days. So far love this phone. Screen is beautiful.

1656,B00A2V7BA4,Gavin Greenwalt,5,19-Nov-12,False,Great Phone,"I'm going to be honest, I mostly use my phone for: texting, talking and taking pictures with the occasional app usage. The camera, is fantastic. It's not the second coming of Christ but it's very good for a camera phone. I didn't think a camera was that important until my last phone's camera was terrible. Now I realize it's one of the most important features. Performance is good. Reception is good. The screen is as sharp as I could imagine would be useful at that size. Battery life yesterday was about 16 hours so no worries there. Windows Phone 8 is excellent. Everything is integrated and works well. You don't need a camera app and a facebook app etc. The one photo app brings in all of your photos from everywhere as well as integrating all of your contacts. The one downside of Windows Phone though is that the app selection isn't great. If you need that esoteric tiny app made for 10 people... Windows Phone definitely doesn't have it. The great thing about Windows Phone 8 though is that I don't find myself needing apps. The core OS experience is extremely well thought out and covers 99% of my usage. I don't have a single 3rd party app pinned to my home screen. Lastly Xbox Music is the main reason I went with Windows Phone and I highly recommend it. By far the largest music selection of the streaming options and you can also download songs for offline listening. I prefer the streaming system since I prefer to listen to a variety of music which would be prohibitively expensive to own.

When you hold it in your hand it feels like a quality product and the way it slopes on the sides helps for your hand to cradle it. Also the way all the manual buttons (volume, power/lock, camera) are on the side of the phone allows for you to intuitively use the phone one handed despite its larger size. I was skeptical of the wireless charging as first, seemed like a frivolous add on, but I have to admit it is nice to just pick the phone up off the charge pad. The camera has been pushed hard by Nokia and I have to admit it takes some great low light photos and you have to work to take a shaky photo with it. Also I feel like the image quality is clearer than your typical smartphone camera. The screen is also very impressive. It does as advertised work with gloves on and in direct sunlight increased the contrast on the screen so items pop out a bit more which is great when you trying to read an email on the go. In addition I don't feel the glare from the sun is all that noticeable. The introduction of the dual core processor is an improvement over the WP7 I had, it makes an already smooth OS even smoother and very responsive.

Since that meant she is off imessage I decided to try the switch to Android too. Bought the Nokia 7.1. This thing is so great. I would prefer to hold it over an iPhone XR any day. So light. Other thoughts - Great screen. Android is pretty cool once you customize it. Camera is totally fine, and I use camera for my career. This camera is better than I expected. Battery lasts the day. Phone calls are not as clear as the iPhone but they seem to be sufficient. ""Ok Google"" doesn't work hands free on my Nokia but that's probably either a software bug or my fault. Push the button and it works. Notifications on Android are way better and more productive than in my iPhone. That's a nice surprise.

1601,B00A2V7BA4,Falling Maple,3,19-Jan-13,False,"Before buying it, read all the negatives!","I wanted to switch to Nokia Lumia 920 from iphone, was religiously waiting for it despite iphone 5 announced later but available earlier. But, now I am at times wonder about my decision. Here I am writing as someone who is working (meaning I can't be bother with apps like angry bird etc....) and not techies who like to control every details of phone usage, down to memory. I just want to use the phone for a couple purposes, make phone calls, read/edit ppt, doc easily, can check restaurants review using yelp when I am out, airlines app when I travel, texting, calendar that syn properly ... Many can talk about the pros, but here are the cons I have encountered after some use: 1. Apps: I'm not crazy about apps but only need a few one that I would use smart phone for. - No UA travel apps or triptracker. UA is the big business travel airline. Huge negative for me. I don't like tripit that grab stuff from email. - Yelp. No bookmark or log-in. Half-baked app. - Line/viber, no voice call and no magic jack. - no expedia - no Wellsfargo, may only affect west coast - adding some appointments to the calendar from website, eg. Alaska airlines, doesn't seem to work properly. But, the phone is amazingly integrated with facebook/linkedin. But, that's not the primary use of the phone for me. 2. Search *button* at bottom right. When you try to use the phone with one hand, you keep touching the search accidentally, then Bing would pop up while you are in the middle of something else. Very annoying. 3. Text input. I find typing a little bit harder than iphone, maybe the sensitivity. iPhone tends to over-correct spelling and Window phone under correct. Too many typos texting as a result. Other language inputs like Chinese, Japanese are not ideal. 4. Battery life. The battery life is horrible sometimes. Died before I came home. Definitely not as long as iPhone. I have a long train ride. The unreliable battery life is inconvenient esp I used it as a hotspot for my iPad. Seriously considering re-activating my iPad data plan. 5. In regards to the well-integrated with Facebook, you could easily post something like photo unitntentionally as u do not need Facebook app for status update. Conclusion, I wouldn't say that I regret buying it but I would probably not buy it if I don't have iPad with LTE option. Microsoft needs to improve user experience and Nokia needs to improve the battery life.

1429,B00A2V7BA4,Brian L.,5,19-Jan-13,False,Very Nice,"I've been eagarly anticipating the next Windows Phone. This Nokia is that. First, I'll list my past devices (you need to know what I'm basing this review off of) *Blackberry Curve (Blackberry) *Palm Treo 750w (Windows) *iPhone 2G (iOS) *iPhone 3gs (iOS) *Samsung Captivate (Android) *HTC Inspire (Android) *Samsung Focus (Windows Phone 7) *Samsung Infuse (Android) *HTC Vivid (Android) *HTC Titan 2 (Windows Phone 7.5) *iPhone 4S (iOS) *Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android) *Nokia 920 (Windows Phone 8) If you look at that list, you'll see a lot of different devices, but you'll see 2 earlier flagship Windows Phone devices too. I tried each instance of Windows Phone on the best one available for my network at the time. Early on, I knew this OS had promise. I'm sure its not for everyone, but I have found it to be just as stable and reliable as iOS. It is not as customizable as Android, but well more so than iOS. And honestly, its customizeable enough. No widgets, but the live tiles take care of that. This phone is faster and has a better battery life that EVERY other phone I've ever used. The processor is about average for devices of the day, so I can only assume it uses its resources more efficiently. The phone seems to always know where I am; with Android and iOS devices, they can sometimes take a few seconds (as much as 30-45) to locate you (with Android, because I turned off location to save battery life, with iOS, just because it doesn't track as well). This phone always knows where I am, right away. The mapping software is better than AppleMaps, by a lot, and as good as google maps. I haven't had issues with Nokia's voice guided navigation software, except for a few bugs in the beginning that a software update solved. I get a full 18 hours of use out of this phone if I limit my useage. If I just use the phone like there's no tomorrow, I'll get at least 10. Better than any other smartphone I've used. The screen is beautiful. Higher pixel density than Apple's Retina display, and you can tell. Beautiful. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about blacks looking gray. Not on my screen. Everything looks crisp and clear with amazing colors. Its made out of a nice polycarbonate rubberized plastic. That I like. Doesn't scratche and doesn't get fingerprints. I've dropped it a few times, still works like champ. Definitely feels like a premium phone...more so than the Galaxy S3, less than the iPhone. Still has that Gorilla Glass that's so hard to break. Camera is excellent, but more on that later. About 3 weeks into ownership an OTA upgrade improved it dramatically. Now I would say 'excellent'. No grainy-ness during the daytime. Amazing at night. Better than the iPhone 5. PHONE CONS: Its big and clunky. Switching from the Galaxy S3, its like goinging from a Ferarri to a Mercedes S500. Small and sleek to Big and Boat Like. I got used to it...I'm a big guy, which means big hands and a large frame. That means big pockets too. The size didn't bother me after a while. It'll probably bother you for a little longer, but you'll get used to it too. I was pretty disappointed with the camera when I got it. Nokia overhyped it, but primarily the camera was down right bad in daylight; downright grainy. Very good in low light, but still really disappointing in the day time. That has since been fixed by a firmware update. Windows Phone 7 and 7.5 were betas...and like Microsoft has in the past, they tossed that out into the world onto an unsuspecting public. Even then it had promise. Anyone who uses it freely with an open mind will see that. It is the only phone OS that I've used that is only as complicated as you let it be. Windows Phone 8 is excellent, still not perfect, but better than everything else out there. The appstore has some growing to do. You'll find it lacking in Games, a lot of the games are oriented towards the 'killing time' area rather than the 'killing zombies' area. I would love to see a good first person shooter. If you switch over, you can count on missing about 4 apps. They'll probably be different for you than the apps I miss. I am confident the apps will come. I was missing `Pulse News Reader,' for about 2 months. Now there's something similar, an app I can only refer to as a Pulse-knock-off. Just as good though. There are some quirks with Windows Phone 8 that are infuriatingly annoying, like not very many colors for my tiles...I don't understand why I can't have all the colors of the rainbow. Also, limited notification sounds. Also, I would say that multitasking features for Windows Phone 8 are excellent, but would be better with a full-blown notification center (something you slide down to reveal recent notifications). It's a bit clumsy as it is now. I wouldn't mind changing the font...but that's difficult on an unmodified OS for all of them. I would also like to make smaller than the smallest. I have good vision, I want small print. Anywho, its awesome, I think you'll love it. Give it a try. This was a long review. I hope it was helpful.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

15545,B075FLG6MV,gadgetguy,2,19-Dec-17,True,Disappointed!,"The Nokia 2 is by far the cheapest Android phone one can get with timely Android security updates every month. The next closest is probably the Nokia 3, but the Nokia 3 is not available with a US warranty. The Moto E4 and Moto E4 Plus, which may be the prominent competitors to the Nokia 2, do not receive security updates monthly. I would never buy either of them. The Moto X4, which is part of the Android One program and therefore receives security patches monthly, was intended partly to provide a cheaper alternative to Google Pixel models with Project Fi. However, ""cheaper"" still means a price tag of around $300 at the very least for the Moto X4. I suspect and hope there's a sizable niche of people like me, who are dying for an Android phone that receives timely security updates every month and who don't want to pay for a Pixel or Moto X4 or an Android Blackberry (not super inexpensive and from what I can tell not always super timely with monthly security patches). As a result, I was very excited about the Nokia 2's prompt availability in the US. However, I was sorely disappointed to find out that the phone I received, which shipped out on December 7, only had the September 1, 2017 security patch. It didn't even have the September 5, 2017 security patch, which patched a critical WiFi vulnerability, one that would allow the attacker to take over the phone just by being within WiFi range when WiFi was turned on for the phone. I can't believe it. The Nokia 2 was publicly announced on October 31, 2017. Surely, it should have shipped with at least the September 5, 2017 patch, if not the October 1 or October 5 patches. This is complacent and irresponsible. I haven't tried yet, but I doubt I will be allowed to update over cellular, which means that when I try over WiFi to get the WiFi patch released in the September 5, 2017 update, I'll be exposing myself to the WiFi attack. While I may have higher security requirements than most people, this is reason enough for me to be returning the phone. All the complaints about security aside, the Nokia 2 is a very decent phone. It looks very elegant, in a subdued and minimalistic way. Sitting next to my iPhones (5s, 6, and 10), the Nokia 2 looked more aesthetically pleasing than the much more expensive iPhones. As for what might not be immediately apparent unless seen in person, there are several things worth pointing out. First, the pewter doesn't look grayish as it does in the photos on the Amazon product page. Instead, in person, it looks brownish (picture brown leather shoes or a brown leather belt), but very dark brownish. Although not my very most preferred look, it looks very nice and leans towards conveying masculine. Second, it is not a lightweight phone. According to one website, it weighs 5.68 oz (161 g), whereas, for reference, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s weigh 5.04 oz (143 g) and 3.95 oz (112 g), respectively. Third, the battery life is amazing. It can sit for days (on airplane mode) without battery life dropping more than a couple percentage points or so. Initially, I hated the weight of the phone, but now I think the extra weight but might be a worthwhile tradeoff for the massive battery life.",6.0,Nokia,"Nokia 2 - Android - 8GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5"" Screen - Black - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B075FLG6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-rum+PvIL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FLG6MV,359,194.97,0.0
2492,B00E45043A,old arkiedan,5,19-Dec-14,True,Perfect for an old curmudgeon like myself and an amazing bargain!,"My wife and I are 77 and resisted owning or using cell phones until just last year when we bought one to use as a ""travel phone."" We signed-up with Consumer Cellular (phone only) and bought a very, very cheap flip phone. She's had problems using with the basic flip phone and so, when I saw this one for only $30 (along with the great reviews) I grabbed one. Putting it into service was as simple as removing the slick little sim card from the flip phone, snapping the micro sim (already performated for this purpose) and putting it in the 520. Nothing to it! Frankly, I haven't told her about it yet but, after updating the firmware and the GPS maps, I'm mightily impressed and reasonably certain she'll find it a snap to use. I'm a Linux desktop user and left Windows behind years ago but the integration of Windows 8.1 into this thing is impressive. The more I use it the more impressed I am! My Consumer Cellular plan doesn't include data but I can cruise the internet free via wireless (plenty of hotspots around). After downloading the GPS maps I can use them off-line, a plus for me. My wife's SUV has a Garmin 7"" GPS that she would never part with and I needed one for my old Chevy. The 520 will do nicely. The bottom-line: If you're an old coot like me I believe you'll love the 520 and, for only $29.95, it's a steal! old arkiedan Addendum on December 27: When the Lumia 520 went on further sale a couple days ago I grabbed another one. At $19.95 it's an ourageous steal!

That said, I was surprised at how good this phone is. Here are the things I love about the phone compared to my older phone (newer phones might also do this): - Fantastic camera - Offline maps and offline navigation. I opted to not have a data plan at all, so this was essential. Even without data, I can use the maps to get anywhere. - The wireless charger is cool - The onenote app is awesome. I used evernote on the nexus and one time it deleted something I had written (it might have been an edge case). Anyway, I like the onenote app better and it integrates with how I take notes on my desktop machines. - Little things - I like how you can lock your screen, but configure how long it stays unlocked if you've used it recently. I like how you can press the button to take a picture even if the screen is locked (I'm sure other phones do this too, but my nexus didn't). When it's charging the little icon alternates between percentage and the charging icon (the nexus just had the charging icon). - I'm not an IE fan on the Desktop, but IE 10 on mobile is pretty slick.

Though I knew the phone was unlocked, I had no clue it took a micros sim card, which I was not aware of and meant I had to go to a carrier and switch my sim card. Problem was solved in no time. Anyway back to this review. I was contemplating an Iphone purchase but I could not stand to spend upwards of 450 plus buckaroos on a phone. This cost me under 300 bucks give or take plus a few quality accessories. SO in the budget department alone, this phone gets a gold star. I have read reviews there is a lack of apps....I dispute that HOWEVER, do not expect an array of exactly what you see on android play store. There are a lot of apps for everything you need, some just not as popular. There are financial apps(Citibank, capitalone etc)missing but thats about it. With that in mind, the internet explorer is really smooth(way better than my old phone, my touch 4g slide). It has microsoft word and excel also. The interface is smooth, unbelievable this is a cool phone! One feature that is really different, the GPS navigator. Setting things up did not take long at all. You will be seduced by the sleek look. I am not done playing around with it, but i know now I made a good choice here. I dont know where Nokia has been(I had one in the early 2000s) but I have since had a blackberry and a couple of tmobile high end phones. Nokia has made a giant leap. 4/27/13 After a few more days of use I feel real proud about not caving to buy the iphone. The battery life, which with mytouch 4g was ALWAYS an issue, is really impressive. You get at least a good 10 hours if you leave it on,probably longer if you leave the battery saver option on. I discovered the sky drive(similar to icloud) on Marketplace which gives you additional 7Gigs or so free, plus available upgrades for a fee and you get to store for music or other files. I really do think the only thing that will stop this phone from blowing out the competition unfortunately, are the lack of the 'mainstream' apps. Also some apps free on Google play store(android) might not be on Marketplace(if available) But believe me unless you are one for the bandwagon, this change is worth a try, especially if the iphone or high end androids are a little above your budget.",9.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0

2286,B00CQAODG4,Doug,5,18-Sep-13,False,Best cell phone I have had,"Ok, I have been an Apple freak for years. This year I decided I wanted something different as the IPhones have gotten a little mundane and boring. Even the new IPhone5S and ios7 was looking same old same old. So I tried the Galaxy S4. Had it for about 4 months and hated it. Build quality was poor, battery performance was horrendous, and the screen was nearly invisible outside on a bright day, and totally invisible when I had my polarized sun glasses on. Gave it to my daughter who loved her S3. So I picked up the Nokia 928 Windows 8 Phone. The phone has been awesome. Build quality is far better than the Galaxy S4 and has none of the screen visibility problems of the S4. I can see the screen clearly in full sunlight and even with my polarized sunglasses. Battery life is awesome, all day and will into the next with heavy use. S4 could only make it to bedtime, well, that's when I like to play a few games/watch videos and the 928 still has the juice to get me through. S4 never could do that. As far as Windows Phone 8 OS, well it is fast and flawless. I love it and the tiled interface is fresh, new, easy to use and very practical. If Windows Phone 8 doesn't become #1 or #2, I'll be shocked. IMO it blows the doors off ios and android. Now I am not an app junkie so the catching up that has to take place with the Microsoft app store collection is not a problem for me and no doubt they will catch up and get better. So far everything I have wanted was there or there was a very satisfactory alternative.

910,B00836Y6B2,Maquisito Douglarito,4,18-Sep-13,True,Great Phone!,"I ordered this phone about a week ago. And its been really great since. Positives - The colour display is amazing on this phone -It has a single-core 1.4GHz, that works GREAT! _ - Even though it is a Windows 7.5 (up gradable to 7.8), it still offers so much. Youtube HD, facebook, twitter, skype, whatsapp, tango .. a bunch of apps that satisfied me. -The camera is great! Both back and front. - ZUNE!: Some people complained about the fact that they needed a software to put music, videos and photos on their phone, but it turned out GREAT! If you know how to use the software effectively, you can put music and videos, onto the collection you want and it can sync wirelessly! -The phone feels strong and well built; I mean it should for the size and weight, I guess. -From watching screen reviews on youtube, the screen can be used as a hammer to pound in nails to wood! So the screen is really good and apparently doesn't scratch easily although, I haven't able to test it. -The games are great, but the really good ones you got to pay for .. lol .. buts thats the case for everything. -Having Microsoft Office on your phone is great for students and people who need to write, edit and read docs on the go. The photo-editing capabilities are great! Negatives -even though I knew it was this big (dimension wise) I didn't get a feel for the phone, so when it came, it felt a little too big to be comfortable in your hand. So I'll suggest to anyone, to ensure that you are comfortable with a phone this big.(And Heavy) -Some of the apps for windows phone 7.8, to me, were poorly designed. E.G facebook: you are limited to what you can do from your phone compared to what you can do on the computer, to me, that shouldn't be. - I wish there was a longer battery life.

26678,B07XVZXR5Y,D J,5,18-Nov-19,True,Quite impressed,"Activated and began using this phone a few days ago and so far I'm very impressed with just about everything. Build quality is very solid with virtually no flex, screen feels tough but smooth and is always very responsive. Currently running 9 Pie, and the basic Google apps as well as my usuals (Nextdoor, Fing, Rewards, Airbnb, Grubhub, etc) work great. The camera did take some getting used to because it focuses a bit differently than my previous phone (Vivo 8L) but now that I've gotten the hang of it, I can consistently take impressive pictures in most settings. Works great on T-Mobile and my reception has been solid everywhere I've taken it thus far, LTE and WiFi connect to their respective networks about as quick as you'd hope they could. The language on my particular model was set to English (UK) and Chinese for some reason so I'm not sure what version I got exactly, but after playing around with settings my notifications show up in fahrenheit as opposed to celsius, but I still discard my photos to ""the bin"". Nothing about it made it unusable or confusing, just wanted to make note. Another small gripe is that while the phone feels very solid, the texture of the back is almost ungrippable so a case is mandatory for me. These are just my initial impressions and thoughts, and I'll be updating with pictures and probably more points as I use it more. Very happy so far, though! UPDATE After another week I'm still impressed and happy with my purchase. Added some pictures to show detail and clarity in a few different settings and environments but I am still moving towards shooting in ""pro"" mode since sometimes the camera does focus oddly or can't seem to stay focused properly if the subject is moving. I've been intentionally running 5-6 apps simultaneously to test stability and battery life and thus far it hasn't really buckled performance wise, and the battery seems to be able to last two full days of moderate use or survive an entire day of heavy use with about 20% remaining. I've never really used Google Assistant and I'm not a fan of it, so the dedicated button is useless and sometimes annoying when I'm handling the phone, but with the particular case I bought for it (Gesma is the brand) the button isn't as high-profile and I haven't had as many accidental presses. It would be nice to make it a ""soft key"" where I assign another more useful function (and maybe there is an option I haven't found yet). Minor gripe, and becoming easier to ignore, though.",5.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.2 - Android 9.0 Pie - 128 GB - 48MP Triple Camera - Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 6.3"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Charcoal - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-2-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07XVZXR5Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71JQpRDCyXL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XVZXR5Y,49,329.0,349.0
20550,B07HD3QC65,SST,4,18-Nov-18,True,Solid phone. Meets the expectations of the Nokia brand.,"Being a longtime fan of many of the Nokia phones, this brand licensed phone from HMD does the heritage proud. There are some quirks to be aware of: couldn't format the SD card as internal memory on Oreo on this phone. Didn't want to root it. Same with the chin - which I'm not sure was needed on this device. This is a midrange phone with solid performance. Build quality is better than expected for the price. Display is better than on the Motorola Z and G series phones. Not quite as sharp as the current gen iPhone or Samsung phones but you'd have to put them side by side to really tell the difference in daily usage. Really like the balance across form factor, heft, build quality and headphone jack. Haven't had any problems with gaming, video streaming, or productivity apps. You can tell it's a Snapdragon 636 but I performance is solid and not an issue.

1642,B00A2V7BA4,Jan Rokycana,5,18-Nov-12,False,It is inovative phone and I recomend it to all,"I was waiting for this phone for while as I was user of Nokia N8 which was another great phone it just needed bigger screen. Then I switch to several Android devices mainly for the big screen feature in all after several days of using I got discouraged mainly with short battery life and random restarts and screen bleeding with HTC Amaze. I switched to Iphone 4S where I sacrifice the big screen crewing for functionality. The Iphone served me very well and I did not have any complaints. It was great phone just needed bigger screenº, but I could live with that since the functionality. Then Nokia 808 came to the market and I was really surprised with the camera feature. I was going to buy it has bigger screen then N8 and Symbian is not all that bad, the main feature I like is the FM transmitter that works very well, they shoud include this feature in the Lumia line up. I did not buy the N 808 since there was news that Iphone 5 will have bigger screen and finally NFC integration. When Iphone 5 came up it shattered my hopes. Screen was bigger but not just enough for me it did not seems that bigger in real life and one line of icons was not seller for me and missing integration of NFC is in my opinion bad step from apple. They did not have me as a buyer as I am not interested to get thinner phone that only evolve from previous model but did not bring anything new. In the time the spec of the new Lumias was already out and decided wait for it instead of Iphone. I was quite a wait as we have to wait for MS to unveil their new OS. I believe there is step to innovation and no just evolution. There as several new features in the OS that get me to decide go with them instead of Apple. Now get to the Lumia 920: I read several review when all of the authors complained about the weight of the phone, I consider this is a hype created by Apple and their creation of slim and light phones which I trust are appealing to big masses, but on other side we have the SGIII users that they are going for the size of the screen. When I received the Lumia 920 and unboxed it the weigh did not seems to be that discouraging for me actually the opposite it feels good in my hand and therefore I cannot conclude with the several reviews that the phone is heavy, it is on the heavier side but not as was presented in the reviews. The build of the phone is beautiful, I like the unibody and the screen is nicely flash with the casing. The buttons are flashed nicely and their are not just some plastic one but instead they are made from zirconium which is another proof of the quality build. The screen is vivid and very responsive, I tried the advertised use in gloves and it did work perfectly. The video playback and the web browsing look great. So far one the best screen I ever have the pleasure to use it. Call quality is as shoud be I did not have any issue in my pas week using the phone and I did not look for something out of ordinary it makes calls good, no distorted sound everybody understand me. I used my VOIP client and it worked well on the phone with the 4G network. I highly recommend this for international callings. Now the BIG ONE the camera ""Pure View"" I took several pictures side by side with my Iphone 4S. The Iphone produced quality photo during a day and in lighted room there was some instances that the colors look more vivid. During a low light and night the Lumia is the winner by far. The Iphone photos were grainy with missing details or just dark spots. I have one big complain to the phone software, it is basic and lack of some in-depth settings but this is taking care of by the NOKIA LENSES, which you have to download it from the market. The Nokia Lenses will enhance the phone taking experience. If you looking for great foto/mobil this is it. Battery life, also there was several reviews and concerns about the battery. I charged and discharged the battery when I first got the phone after this operation which is recommended for all phones, I am getting around two days of use. Not bad. Wireless charging, somebody might say it is gimmick but it works and I do like it just lay you phone down. Definitely plus and decision point for me. Conclusion: This is great phone with beautifully build and features. It feels good in a hand. Nokia included several bonus points that should be the decision point for really split buyers. Nokia Drive, Whole world navigation that is offline and works great. Nokia music online based music service that allows you create own playlist but also you can download the music to you phone and use it offline. No need to burn you data plan. Several Nokia apps that is free to Nokia users. I am not saying this phone is better or worst then Iphone or Android devices, but it is different and innovative piece of equipment thet have the price that is appealing. Evrywher you look this day you Iphone and galaxy phones if you want be bit different you shoud get this phone in a color that you like, until you will se Lumia all around you. Then hopefully something else will emerge that will make you different from the group.",10.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1458,B00A2V7BA4,RushCreek519,5,18-Nov-12,False,Best Phone at Any Price,"My new white Lumia 920 is so much better than any other phone, I just don't know where to begin. I'm going to list the items that I think are most important. -Screen By specs the best on any phone, but side-by-side the Nokia screen just pops and looks far superior to anything else. Colors are bright and vibrant, the screen never blurs no matter how fast things move on-screen, you can see the screen well in direct sun, and you can touch the screen and control it with gloves on (brilliant). -Camera The Lumia 920 Pureview camera simply puts all others to shame; take a few shots with friends and compare. When their phone cameras produce dim and blur, the Lumia produces bright and clear. I swear the thing sees far better in the dark then I do (and I mean without flash). Checkout some of the reviews of low-light performance vs iPhone 5 and S III, Lumia is years ahead. -Maps/Navigation Lumia phones come with Nokia Drive with turn-by-turn voice navigation for the entire world, the is far superior to any other GPS. Nokia Navtec powers most car nav systems and on the phone the maps and data are always up-to-date. Driving, walking, biking, and transit nav is provided worldwide, in any language you want and with multiple voices to choose from. You can download maps for any part of the world you want to your phone, so you can download the maps over wifi and have navigation without using your data plan, nice! -Wireless Charging Yes, wireless charging is built-in and AT&T gives you a free charger. So you have this little coaster on your nightstand plugged into the wall, then when you're tired no more fumbling with wires, you just set your phone down and it charges, so cool. -Durability Everyone knows when you drop an iPhone or SIII it breaks, so you need huge bulky cases. Watch some of the Lumia torture tests online and you'll see that it doesn't break when dropped, or let fly from moving car, or baked in oven, or put in freezer, or hit with mallet, or when you use the Lumia to pound in a nail, or even when they use a knife to attempt to cut/scratch the Lumia. This thing is crazy tough and durable, something Nokia has always been known for, while other companies want your phone to break so you'll buy a new one. -Nokia Music Nokia Music is like Pandora or spotify, but with no commercials, you can skip all the songs you want, and you can download mixes to your phone to listen to later (great to download over WiFi so that you don't need to stream on your data plan). Nokia Music is free with Lumia. -Windows Phone 8 Windows phone is fast and smooth, Live Tiles show you everything happening in all your apps on one screen (Facebook, Twitter, etc are integrated into Windows). After using Windows Phone or a Surface, it's impossible to go back to static grids of icons on other platforms (or even Windows 7). Kids corner is great and allows you to give your kid your phone but only allows them into what you've selected for them and keeps them out of your stuff (email, text, etc). I could go on and on: -Lumia is so fast and smooth at everything (dual-core 1.5gHz never sweats) -Lumia has LTE, NFC, Wifi, Bluetooth, worldwide coverage -Nokia apps (City Lens, Cinemagraph, Smart Shoot, Express web) are top notch and useful -Battery life is great -Lumia looks like nothing else.

1554,B00A2V7BA4,FooFoo,4,18-Nov-12,False,"Unique, Innovative, Beauty, Bulky, and Under Developed.","It is extremely beautiful and can do most of the tasks. If you can live up with some of its disadvantages, it is a ""preciousss"" for you. *** The good *** It has a unique user interface which harmoniously blends both functionality and design. Both lock screen and live tiles are nice. Innovative camera. Very good in low light and image stabilizer. It is on par, some said worse, with competitors in bright light. Beautiful. It is one of the most beautiful phone that have ever been created. The materials are premium and the colors are fancy. Huge screen with crisp texts. Office integration is really nice. File transfer is easier than the iPhone 5 but same as Android phone. It has NFC. I don't use wireless charging. *** The bad *** Thick. It really matters. If you can live without case, it can matches with competitors with case. Heavy. Not too heavy but it is. Again, bare phone is as heavy as competitors with case. No rotation lock!!! Oh, dear. Can you forgive??? Try to live with it. WiFi turns off when lock. No original facebook layout. The app is too unique. It wipes away facebook beauty. They should improve their IE10 to better render touch version of facebook. Copy and Paste functionality is underdeveloped. Individual character cannot be selected. No Adobe Flash support. Short of some Apps. The battery life is the worst among current flagship phones. *** Suggestions *** If the bad points do not annoy you, go for it. If you want a small, thin, and light phone, go for iPhone 5. If you want large screen, thin, and light phone, go for SIII or Note 2. I have to admit that iOS and Android is better developed and more matured by the mean time. If you need a better operating system that cover more basic and should be standard functionality, go for iOS or Android. If you need some Apps, go for iPhone 5 or Android. If you need Flash support, go for Android. *** Notes *** It does not better integrate to the Windows 8. This Phone is on par with iPhone 5, Galaxy SIII, Note 2, and other flagship Android. I will choose Galaxy SIII or Note 2 for functionality and large screen but not design, Razr for better design. Be aware that 5.0 inch phones with 1080 pixel with IGZO display are already out. I will choose iPhone 5 for thin and light. The OS is matured and a bit smoother than Android. And it will be a good collection of Apple gadgets. It is expensive but not a matter for me.

It's buttery smooth and transitions are fast. Everything just looks stunning on this screen. The camera just blows any other smartphone out there. Having owned an iphone 5 and many android phones, the lumia 920 beats them all in every way. With image stabilization it takes amazing video and photos even in low light. No other camera compares! Nokia maps, city drive, dolby sound with equalizer for the music fans, and especially social integration all work seamlessly. The os is truly a pleasure to use. Integration with office 365 works seamlessly. With the high level build quality , definitely outscores all of these cheaply built smartphones. Apps....well there are plenty of USEFUL ones in the store and it's growing. I was skeptical about the weight...is it heavy...NO it feels solid in the hand and weight is not noticeable in the pocket. The battery is on par if not better than the other phones I've owned.

I've used it intensively day and night. Every piece of apps work excellently. Both hardware and software are implemented flawlessly. Top quality. Setup three yahoo email accounts,one Gmail,one hotmail,one Comcast email. New email messages are pushed to my home screen automatically with numbers. Tiles can be enlarged to show latest message, since I have too many email accounts, I use the smallest title on home screen. Nokia drive + is the fastest GPS navigation, it locks the satellites signals within 3 seconds. Only complaint is it won't announce the side of street at destination when I followed it to a at&t store in west Dundee,Il. TomTom has the same issue but Garmin and iGuidance donot. Hope Nokia knows the issue and a fix is on the way. I downloaded maps for whole USA,Canada,China mainland and Hong Kong. It used up about 5 GB, it still leaves me 22 GB for other purposes. I shoots a beautiful lake view HD video with gooses flying over and landing in the lake of Elgin,IL. Floating lens completely removed my hand shaking. Battery lasts me whole on intensive usage. I beleive for regular use, it can last 2 days for one full charge after twice cycling. I am writing the review from my Nokia Lumia 920 from ie10 web browser in mobile mode. oops, it auto sent out. let me continue from my laptop. I installed shopping apps like amazon, amazon kindle, ebay, cragslist,homedepot, gasbuddy. unfortunately there is no amazon wireless app. I used the ebay app and ordered a nokia battery for my wife, the experience is so fantastic, there is no need to bother my laptop at home via wifi or on the road on my 3GB data pro plan. it is kind of freedom. yes, I am liberated from my laptop by nokia lumia 920. I have more time with my family now. I installed banking apps like chase, bank of america, but citi is not there. Heard my complaint, citi ? I'll move my account to chase if you don't create a app for windows phone 8. actually chase app can also do the check deposit, I've already set it up and will deposit all my check payments to chase. I installed realtor and zillow apps for shopping houses. redfin is not available at the time of writing. oh, i forgot to mention yahoo email has an issue, it can not send out email for free email account except the one that is bound to sbcglobal.net (at&t dsl account) even I set up exact smtp settings as sbcglobal.net. so obviously it is yahoo which intentionally disables free email account to send email via smtp server. Recently I went to shop a SFH, I used the PureView camera to take pictures of outside and inside of the single family house. it turned out excellent pics. no need to carry my huge Canon digial DSLR any more. finaly, I want to thank nokia, microsoft, att and mobile app developers to set me free from my garmin gps, lenovo laptop, canon DSLR camera, etc, let me have more time to stay with my family.",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1682,B00A2V7BA4,Alvin C.,5,18-Nov-12,False,The phone I've always wanted,"I've been a longtime iPhone and Android fan that's been craving something new, yet I wanted my phone to have the important features below: :: TL;DR :: My important features. 1) Group threaded message (like the iPhone) 2) Stellar pictures 3) Fast internet 4) Good battery life 5) Good as an actual phone Bonuses: 1) 32GB 2) Offline maps + voice navigation 3) Outlook integration 4) Social Network integration 5) Nokia Music Lacking: 1) App selection (not necessarily bad) ::Meat of the Review:: Messaging: This has been headache-free for me. Most of my contacts are on the iPhone and this phone works seamlessly in communicating with them as a group. Stock android does not do this out of the box. The Lumia just works here. Camera/Video: This phone takes gorgeous photos. I used this to take photos at a family party and my family and friends were consistently impressed. Please don't take this to mean ""showoff"". These were unsolicited comments about the quality and clarity of the photos. Also, this phone does your viewers a favor by offering fluid and quality video capture. Helpful against nausea from shaky videos. Fast Internet: LTE, HSPA+, Wi-Fi. All work, all are plenty fast. Battery: This phone lasts me all day. At times I've had 13 hours and other times 40+ hours of battery life. With anything, your mileage may vary depending on how you use your phone and how often. As a phone: Calls are clear even through speakerphone. People didn't have a problem hearing me as well. The Nice to Haves: The 32GB storage, Nokia's offline maps + navigation, work email and the social media integration are all big bonuses for me. What's this mean? I can take lots of pictures, I can use navigation without worry over data usage, and I can contact my work and personal contacts seamlessly. I also mentioned Nokia music. It's similar to Pandora, but I can save the music for offline listening and I don't have to pay for it. Having this feature was a pleasant surprise. App Market: To get the elephant out of the way, the windows phone app market is lacking in selection, but you'll find the main stuff here: facebook, yelp, netflix, angry birds, etc. The lack of selection isn't a conflict for me. The phone already has what I absolutely want (messaging, navigation). I don't personally download a lot of apps because I like my phone free of clutter. Random Thoughts: User Interface: The UI is simple and very friendly to work with. I don't feel you'll have a problem navigating this phone. Internet browsing: IE works well, pages display fine from my use. Phone Screen: Pretty and Vivid. Colors feel just right and not overly saturated. Phone's brightness also works well in any lighting condition. Phone Design: Except for the protruding volume, camera, and sleep/power buttons on the right side of the phone, this is a beautifully designed phone. Phone Weight: You definitely feel the weight of the phone. For me its comfortable. You'll want to hold one before making your own judgement here. Final word: The system isn't as robust as Android so people who love tinkering ""under the hood"" with their phone may want to stick to Android. If you're heavily invested in the Android or iOS app markets, its probably best to stay where you are. If you're looking to jump ship from either platform into a friendly platform with generous phone features, consider checking out the Nokia Lumia 920.",19.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

17,B001GQ3DJM,Nathan Gaida,3,18-Nov-08,False,Ok phone to tide me over,"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now.

4859,B00O15MWOM,sarah,4,18-May-15,True,Great value! But bad camera and screen quality.,"I bought the Nokia 530 as a second phone to use exclusively for international travel. I primarily use an iPhone 6 through Verizon. However, I wanted something where I could get an international plan through T-Mobile that would have good service in Europe (T-Mobile is based in Germany). I also did not want to pay a lot since this is not my primary phone, and I didn't want to worry too much about it getting lost or stolen. So far, I've been very impressed with the value and quality for such a cheap price. The battery life and overall performance is good. For basic functions like text, email, calling, and basic Internet use, I would say this phone is excellent for the price. I am also pleasantly surprised with the Windows phone interface. However, there are a few relativly significant downsides to this phone. The camera is pretty bad. Granted, I'm spoiled with my iPhone 6 camera, but I feel like the Nokia 530 camera is equivalent to a flip phone camera circa 2005. If you are using this phone for travel, this may be a problem if you want to take photos to capture trip memories! Also, the screen quality in general is not that great. For emails and reading text, this isn't a huge problem, but it's noticeable when viewing photos and videos. Overall, you get what you pay for!

Kindle app is great, big screen you really enjoy reading your book as well as listening to your audiobooks if you install Audible which also works fine.

Decided to give the Windows phone a chance because the price was right and boy was I surprised. Like someone else said, at first it may seem a little alien but after only a few short days of using it I'm totally in love. After upgrading to windows 8 on the PC this phone is a perfect transition between the two. -Size and feel: After having this for a few days and then picking up my old iPhone, it feels puny compared to the 920. The screen size is noticeably bigger and seems sturdier even though it's the same Gorilla Glass. Overall it's about as big as I'd like a phone to be, any larger and it would be in the realm of the Samsung Note. -Camera: What's there to not say about the camera, it's fantastic. It's amazing to me that the camera in the phone is almost as good as my SLR, and a heck of a lot easier to carry around! Low light shooting is awesome and with the different Nokia apps there's a ton of editing and shooting styles you can do. There are great apps, like panorama and photosynth that allows you to take 360 degree photos. Facial recognition and focus all work quite well. The ability to send to your Skydrive or multiple other social networks is super easy to do. -Apps: Imagine a tiny desktop in your hand, this phone runs apps just like a full fledged computer. With Office built in, you have the ability to do Spreadsheets, tables, presentations and more. It also includes Xbox games and an App store that is growing more and more everyday. It's easy to use and always has good apps on the front page of the store to check out. Very easy to download and automatically notifies of updates. There's too much to fit in one review!

With a below average Snapdragon 430. However, this phone has been quite amazing to use, and continues to work as my primary devices after its replacement died. For my uses of a phone, my important factors are: -Text based email and messaging -Battery life that lasts through one of my work days -An OK camera, I don't need a camera on a phone to look like a DSLR, just something that takes clear pictures -Good LTE, Wi-Fi, and NFC -Regular security and OS updates For my needs, I knew that an 800 series Snapdragon is overkill, and now I believe the same for the 600 series, which was viewed as the mid-range SoC. Consider me a light mobile user but this phone has been meeting all of my low expectations and can power through the day. The other feature I am amazed with is that this is a Google One device. a meaning that it meets the hardware and technical requirements to run a stock version of Android, and receive updates directly from Google as if it was a Pixel. My Nokia 6 is running Android 9, with the latest security updates. That is really nice considering other brands support updates until their next flagship is released. What made me want to write this review, is that I did get a different phone in 2018 to replace this one. Not even a year later, the newer phone broke, by shutting itself off, and not allowing me to turn it back on again. I got this phone back out, swapped my SIM, and it powered on, allowing me to update the phone and install all my apps. This phone has outlived higher spec devices.

I like the heaviness of it and the curves. It's perfect! I just didn't like the operating system which is Android, since it's my first time coming from a Windows phone. I had to look up online for a bunch of hacks since a lot of what the Andriod system was doing is slowing the phone and making it lag unnecessarily. I'm not used to waiting a second or two just for the text screen to pop up. The camera is ok. Don't zoom. It sucks and use the editing system to correct the colors. Also that ""Beautify"" option on the camera will make selfies look gorgeous. A micro SD card is required. I don't use a lot of apps but they do update a lot and ironically the Android operating system already takes a chunk of the 8GB. Half of it actually. One of the problems I've run into is receiving pictures. I wasn't receiving them. It had a lot more to do with T-mobile than the phone. I just restarted it or tried to look for a better signal. I'm not sure about games. I don't have any on it but I don't think it's capable of gaming. The most usage I have gotten out of the phone is for emails, social media, reading, youtube, surfing the net, and GPS navigation. That's my everyday use and it lasts for more than a day. There are ways to make it last longer and to fix the system and it's all online. Plus it also helps that the phone is built well.

3605,B00HWEMZ1E,N8,2,18-Jul-14,True,Disappointing experience,"Very disappointing. So, I have used Android phones for many years and this past January decided to give Windows Phone a chance. Well, first of all, when I started out using it, I thought, It's not THAT bad. Sure, there are a few apps here and there that aren't available but no big deal. Then I went to Chicago for a first time visit and not having the Uber app? Actually it was a big deal. (I actually had to send that phone back for a replacement because of a weird bluish spot in the screen.) 7 months later my frustration came to a head and I switched back to Android. Here's the takeaway, IMHO, about Windows Phones, particularly the Nokia Icon... If you decide to use a Windows Phone get used to seeing these messages: Something went wrong. Sorry, cannot post to Facebook at this time. Wi-Fi unavailable You exited the Facebook app so picture cannot be posted. Cannot load data at this time. Refreshing. Loading. And etc, etc. The biggest pro is that the camera on this phone is FANTASTIC. I mean, I will REALLY miss the quality of the photos this phone takes. But it's sad that a flagship phone can't even do something simple like posting directly to a friend's wall on Facebook. Or if the screen goes into sleep while you are waiting for the 5 minutes for it to upload a photo, the process will be canceled. Or the constant over-heating that happened with both of the phones. Or the incredibly bad wi-fi connection issues both phones had. Did I mention the battery? Bla....charge at work, home and on the road because that battery won't make it very far. I loved Nokia back in the pre-smart phone days and I guess I was hoping that allure of the brand would guarantee a great experience but unfortunately it hasn't. So, in comparison, I'm back on Android. Within the first few days of having my new Android phone I've noticed that when I go to share a photo to Facebook, I click ""Share"" and then choose Facebook and write whatever about the photo and press upload and....it's done. No, ""loading"" no ""refreshing"" no nothing. IT JUST WORKS. The connectivity to our wi-fi? Perfect and never drops it. All those apps, including Uber? Downloaded. Battery? Amazing! (of course that depends on what size battery your phone comes with but still.) And of course, there's the welcoming arms of Google. And frankly for someone who uses gmail it's really a no-brainer to have an Android phone because of all the integration with Google Drive, calendars, etc. Some things I have actually found in the market from Microsoft that I really liked, such as OneNote and OneDrive (which has all the awesome photos I took on the Icon). So I was glad to be able to port over a few Windows Phone features that I enjoyed. So here's the deal. For myself, I found that in the end there just isn't any reason big enough for an Android/Google user to switch to a Windows Phone. It wasn't a HORRIBLE phone by any stretch of the imagination, but it was certainly a frustrating platform that felt very buggy, lots of issues and frankly not worth the frustration for a ""flagship"" phone. I think for a first-time user a Windows Phone would be an ok one to start out with. But for most of us, there just aren't enough reasons to switch. I hope for the best for MicroSoft and I really miss the old days of Nokia. But looks like I'm gonna be in the Android camp (and very happily so) for the conceivable future.",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

Alas, it does not have predictive text, even though the online manual claims it does, as well as my pre-purchase call to Nokia tech-support lead me to believe. After receiving the phone, and not finding how to activate it, I learned from another call to Nokia that this phone does not in fact have that feature. Who can text in this day and age without a predictive system? Much-too-much effort for that. Even my old trusty Motorola has predictive text, and is app. 12 years old now. Also, the back-lighting for the key-pad is too dim, and therefore not enough contrast to see the numbers in low-light.

1743,B00A2V7BA4,Philip Geer,2,18-Jan-13,False,Windows Phone Rocks Nokia hardware not so much.,"Let me start out by saying I like the new Windows Phone 8 software it needs to mature some but it's a great start I really love how it handle Contacts and Social Media they need to add Google chat but they partnered with Facebook) the live tiles for things like weather apps and social apps are pretty cool and I'm sure as more apps come out and mature they find great uses for that feature. That said I have returned one phone already and I'm about to return my Second because of a bad proximity sensor in the hand set. The sensors job is to turn off the screen while you hold the phone to your head this save you battery life but when you pull the phone away it should turn the screen back on. In the two phones I've had this sensor has gone bad in about two weeks on each phone. The sensor is located just above the N in Nokia on the right side of the phone just to the right of the camera lens. I've seen people say that just cleaning the screen fixes the issue for them, but that fix does not work for me I've also seen where people say blowing with canned air in the ear piece fixes it for them again not for me. The only fix that seems to work for me is to push on the glass in the upper left corner, the screen comes on and as soon as I let up off it goes. If you're really fast you can push the power switch a couple of times the screen flashes you might be able to hang up the call while it flashes The other issue I can see is that dust is under the screen by the screen side camera next to the ear piece. If a two week old phone has dust under the screen already what's going to happen in a year I'd bet you won't be able to use that camera but that's not as big a deal to me as the sensor issue.

They have an issue where occasionally when you update the device it enters into ""download mode"" and it basically ruins your phone because you cannot get out download mode, and while in download mode you can't do anything. Upon emailing Nokia they told me to send in my phone and they will fix it. I never ended up doing that because who knows how long that would take and I need my phone daily for work. One of the main reasons I bought the phone is for the longevity of the device (build quality and android one). But until they fix this major issue I will not buy another Nokia phone. Although when and if they fix it I will probably only buy Nokia because I did love the phone which is ultimately why I'm making this review. I want to have another Nokia but I can't until this is fixed.

20745,B07HD3QC65,Mark A,1,18-Aug-19,False,Mediocre phone - spend more for a better one or spend less for one that is just as good,"In a nutshell, this phone under delivers for the price point. I would (and did) spend extra money for a Google Pixel 3a which is hands down better or spend less for something equivalent. The phone also suffers from software issues that other phones running the same version of the OS do not (discussion below). Finally, Nokia would not honor the warranty for what was clearly a manufacturing issue (discussion below). Pros: - Has MicroSD slot and two SIM slots (but see Cons) - Camera is fine Cons: - Suffers from various software/hardware interaction failures. e.g., does not correct report cell strength to car via Bluetooth, issues responding to phone calls - High probably Nokia will not honor warranty by claiming moisture damage - Can use micro SD and 1 SIM or 2 Sims, but not micro SD and 2 Sims More detail. Bought two of these phones, one for myself and one a couple months later for another family member. I liked (or wanted to like) the phone enough initially to recommend it to another family member. However, over the course of several months it became apparent that there were lots of glitches that were not going to be solved by a software update. Chief among these was the bluetooth connection to my car. Specifically, after about a minute of connection time, it would report the signal strength as 0 to my car making it impossible to initiate a call from my car. I tried 3 cars total including 2 rentals and had the same problem. I also encountered situations where the phone would not answer even though I swiped correctly to answer. This problem was intermittent. The second phone was used by a family member who started to have a problem with the phone not recharging because the connector board was not making a connection unless pressure was applied in a certain way. This issue appeared 3 to 6 weeks after buying the phone. As we did not buy a service plan, the retailer initially forced us to use the manufacturer's warranty. Nokia sent it back as unrepairable due to moisture damage. The phone was in a case and was never immersed in water, so that claim was pretty dubious. We brought it back to the retailer, finally got to a manager, discussed these points and a few more. He opened it up to look for water damage. He found none and offered us a store credit within a minute. Final thoughts: I had several Nokia Lumia Windows phones and loved them. Since they got in and out of the phone business, things have not been the same. I will never purchase a Nokia phone again (that was a brilliant business decision by the person who tried the ""chalk it up to water damage"" con). As this was the highest end Nokia phone, I would recommend you just stay clear of the brand completely until things change. We replaced the broken Nokia 7.1 by a Google Pixel 3a and that phone just works and has a much better camera (though it lacks a micro SD slot). Then about 2 weeks later I dumped my original Nokia 7.1 and bought a second Pixel 3a. Technically, my phone had no hardware issues, but it just was unpleasant to use because of the issues noted. While I'm out the $350 I paid original, I am no longer suffering.

But as I began to use my phone more and more it started to glitch on me. This started happening as early as three weeks from the first time I used it. Since then I've had to reboot it three times, the Bing button keeps popping up even though I am not hitting it at all. I'll have it rotated to avoid that and it still happens. The same thing happens with the voice command. The sound won't come off so when it happens in class my phone is always the loudest thing and it wont turn off until I tell it cancel or find another way to cancel it. My screen has frozen, the camera button doesn't always work and I'm tired off yelling at my phone to cancel the multiple times it throws the voice command at me. I've counted more than ten times its repeated the voice command consequitively without me touching the key. This phone is not worth it.

2211,B00CQAODG4,Kutya,5,18-Aug-13,True,This is an awesome smartphone,"Where do I start? I guess since it's a phone I'll start with the voice quality. It is as clear as a land line, and that has not always been my experience with smart phones. I've had numerous other smartphones, the most recent an HTC Thunderbolt that had fairly poor call quality. The speaker phone has great quality too. The camera is incredible. Even the front facing camera produces high quality photos, and the phone has a number of built-in photo editing features. I've been trying to find a receipt scanning software program that will replace manually entering my business expenses, but the cameras on my other portable devices don't have good enough resolution for those great programs to work. Last night I tried scanning on my 928 and it came out crystal clear. That brings me to Windows Apps. That is the one weakness with this phone. I didn't realize how much I was going to miss the huge selection of Android apps. Windows has all the basics in productivity, games, entertainment, but just doesn't have as much to choose from. I'm sure that will improve with time. I bought the wireless charging pad and love it. No hooking the phone up to it. I just lay the phone on the charging pad (which does have to be plugged in to the wall or a computer). This phone charges faster than any smartphone I've had in the past. However, if you're using programs heavy on graphics like games, it goes through battery pretty quickly. I'm not getting nearly as much time per charge as I expected. The fact that it has a sealed battery means that I can't just pop in a spare battery when I run down, so it's essential to have a portable battery to plug into on the go or a phone charging cable. Customizing the home screen is easy, making it convenient to access the icons I need most often. The only button placement I don't like is the camera button. I take dozens of accidental pictures every day because that button is fairly sensitive and is placed on the side right where the heel of my hand fits. If I change to hold it in my left hand, my little finger rests on that button and triggers it. Hopefully I'll get used to this problem and adjust my touch. The phone has a good heft to it, feeling like it's made of good quality materials, but not so heavy that it bothers me. I have fairly large hands for a woman, and it fits just right in my hand. I bought this phone on the recommendation of a friend who has much smaller hands than I and the size is no problem for her. Overall, I'm happier with this phone than any I've owned in the past.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

4881,B00O15MWOM,Ryan A.,5,18-Apr-15,True,AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do ...,"I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you. This review is simply about the transitioning from iPhone or Android to the new Windows format. Firstly, If you DO NOT already use Windows 8 or 8.1 on your personal computer, before buying this phone, you will have a few problems with it. Hence, AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do not use a windows 8/8.1 machine. Meaning the new windows format is a little difficult to understand. But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone. But, that is just my opinion! However if you DO use windows 8/8.1 on your personal computer, you will have a much easier time with the transition from iPhone or Android to the Windows Operating system on a cell phone. Personally, I do use Windows 8.1 on my Laptop. So it was a WAY easier of a transition to this phone. Oh! and for the IPhone and Android people: At the least, this Windows phone IS A LOT FASTER!!! Yes, this windows phone has some issues (the annoying type), But so does the windows Operating Systems on computers! But, like every new product on the market, There are adjustments that need to be made (Also known as UPDATES!!!). I've had this phone for about 3 weeks now. But, The bugs are being worked out already. When I fist received the phone, I notice a few glitches(Like being kicked off of the internet while browsing.) But, after doing the updates a couple of times, It stopped kicking me off. So, the fixes are in progress. If you are a die hard windows 7 or Vista user, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PHONE! It is nothing like the operating systems of old. In Closing, My suggestion would be to try using windows 8/8.1 for a while (Like 2 weeks or so), If you like it, you should have very few issues with the new phones. If you think this is just a fad, and refuse to upgrade yourself. Then you will be left behind like the NOW OBSOLETE WINDOWS XP!!! Yes windows XP was a good operating system. It has run is life course and is now time to bury it! It is called Progress People!!! Just remember, If you are getting this phone, DO THE UPDATES!!! It will fix most of its issues.

1795,B00A7F57EM,lisaloopers,2,17-Oct-13,True,_Still_Not Happy With This Phone,"Update 7/28/2014: Wow. Just wow. I just don't know where to start. I thought I really wanted this phone, coming from Android phones. It's been almost 2 years and I am still not too pleased with it. When I first got the phone last year, I realized many of the apps I'd used on my Androids weren't available yet. I'm not heavily involved with social media, but I did use Facebook, Craigslist, Noom and sometimes Pinterest. Facebook did just this month finally update their MS app, a definite improvement. Initially, there were several similar apps, but either the MS-specific ones weren't well-developed or the more generalized just didn't work well on this phone. I haven't looked lately, so perhaps there have been improvements in the others. My teenager, admittedly more knowledgeable about technology and trends than I am, offered the analogy of how iphone, android and windows phones are respectively analogous to mac, microsoft and linux computer systems. That helped. But at least he was kind enough not to call me clueless. What I like: --Hand-friendly shape and the size of the viewing area --Live tiles-can pin to the start screen any function you regularly use, tiles are easily rearranged to the size /position that best suits your needs; also, the tile colors can be changed from the garish primary colors you usually see in Nokia Windows Phone ads --Fairly simple to navigate your way through the phone/screens --Calendar and other reminders are more useful than with my Droid/google calendar --Camera takes nice images, especially in low light conditions; video is usually pretty good quality, too What I Do Not Like: --The speakers are tinny, atrocious, just terrible. With my previous phones, the sound quality was surprisingly good, which is why I started using them for more than just speakerphone calls. I know most people use headphones for calls and music, but I prefer to listen to music via speakerphone in an arm band or chest pocket when running trails. I'm usually sharing the trail with others on mountain bikes or horses, so having my ears open is just safer. Besides, by having my ears open, I, too, am open, to the possiblity of interacting with other humans around me. And I'm not blaring my music, imposing it on others. Unlike the ubiquitous private phone conversations now being carried on in any public space. --Having to set up another email account to use the phone --Nokia Music was advertised as a data-free way to listen to music, but it shuts down repeatedly and it's fairly limited in its selections anyway, so I stick with Pandora, Spotify, etc. --Many web pages, such as Craigslist and various news and literary sources, for example, do not format properly on this phone. It almost makes me dizzy to have to pan back and forth, after zooming in, to read a news article or Craigslist post, because it doesn't automatically resize when you double-tap the screen, as my old Androids did. Wow. Just wow. Thanks for letting me vent, to those of you who scanned and moved on to the next review. I hope my insight was helpful in some way. Some of us don't buy phones frequently, so we're a little more invested in researching our choices, hearing what others have to say, before we make that committment.",2.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 822 16GB Windows Phone Black - Verizon,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Windows-Phone-Black/dp/B00A7F57EM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxGoYUWTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A7F57EM,62,204.16,0.0

Solid polycarbonate that doesnt scratch and very solid super smooth feel (I have the black one) People are amazed of how smooth everything runs.

I think people will find out that this is a simple phone with an easy interface. Things are done differntly than on an iphone so you might have to relearn stuff.

Had been reading reviews about some of the new phones out there and was thinking of an iPhone 5 but really was interested the positive reviews about the Nokia Lumia 920's camera. The best thing about the camera is how well the pictures come out when you are indoors in poor light. They have added an image stabilized lens mounted on springs and it really works. Videos are also so much smoother. The battery life has been very good for me and it is very easy to get a full day out of the phone with 3 emails updating and 4 or 5 background tasks going on. This includes a healthy amount of web surfing and spending some time on the phone. I noticed one reviewer liking the phone but problems with syncing. I have the opposite opinion as it is so easy just to use Media Player to sync your music, photos and such to the phone. In fact it kind of feels like a blast from the past as to how easy it is to drag the music over to the phone, much like an mp3 player that I use to have. There is also a desktop program that can also be used to sync with the phone. The call quality is top notch. The phone is a bit heavier and for some this may be a problem. I personally like the solid feel and the build quality make this feel very durable. There are a few videos online showing a reviewer torturing the phone and it stands up well. Not that I am recommending taking a knife or drop testing your phone but I really think it should handle everyday use just fine.

20539,B07HD3QC65,Simon,3,17-May-19,True,RMA'd 3 times.,"---9/16/2019--- Finally received my Nokia back. I'll see what the story entails after some usage over time. The repair ordering is painless aside from the wait, but it's worth it knowing that shipping is free, as long as I still have my warranty. ---9/9/2019--- Nokia's quality management has plummeted terribly. This is my third time RMAing the phone, and this time the charge port stopped working. It has been two weeks since the repair facility received it and I haven't received word back as to when the phone will be repaired, but if it were to be my guess, never. ---Previous Review--- The size makes it easy to handhold, the camera works, but doesn't offer optical stability, only electronic (which is useless), and most importantly the screens on this phone are terrible. I had to RMA this phone twice. The first time it was for a dead pixel. This second time is for the entire half of the screen giving me dead pixels. It has occurred to me that this Nokia branded phone is not what it use to be and instead became the complete opposite as their screens are fragile and will stop working for no reason. I'd do almost anything to get my robust Nokia from the 2000's back, but it's still ringing somewhere in the world buried in a plastic graveyard.

1091,B00836Y6B2,Sophia H,5,17-May-13,True,First shot at living the unlocked life,"I have been using a Blackberry Curve for the last 3 1/2 years and avoiding a smartphone because of the additional costs associated with new activations. However, I decided that it may be time to upgrade since I would like to be able to use this phone overseas on travel. I did some research - thought about going with the new Blackberry Q10 - but the outright unlocked purchase price is high and I wanted to test out an unlocked GSM phone before I went hog wild on the phone of my dreams. I went with the 900 because it is affordable but not too outdated yet (although the 925 AT&T and 928 Verizon are already out). I read great reviews on the design and wanted to go with something other than the iPhone. I was not disappointed. Kudos to Feel Good Sales - the product was unlocked and worked right out of the box when I took it down to T-Mobile for a SIM card. It was just as advertised - new (AT&T), unlocked. Please keep in mind that there are many different vendors that sell under the same item number so you don't really know who the seller is. I chose to go with an Amazon Fulfilled seller, believing that there is a bit more consumer protection if they are responsible for the processing of the transaction. Also believing that if a seller uses Amazon to fulfill, they are probably selling what they're advertising since returns seem to be processed through Amazon also. In any case, be careful which vendor you choose and check their ratings. I read some of the reviews for other vendors (especially direct sales) that would lead me to believe that not all sellers are created equal. So, it's super easy to set up the Lumia 900 and I found lots of forum hints on it. The one thing that I had a problem with to start was sending and receiving MMS (pics through text). But I found a topic online that told me I needed to download the Network Setup app from Nokia and select my provider - it worked perfectly. Marketplace is really easy for downloading apps because I already have an Microsoft e-mail account. I am not a heavy user of apps so I don't really have much to say about them but they're there and I will probably look into them more. I have read lots of reviews saying the battery life is short but then so it is for the iPhone. Do your research but I think the Lumia 900 is a good choices - especially for me, as a starter smartphone that I wouldn't be afraid to take overseas. I think at some point, I might want to get a newer, international model - hopefully after they improve battery life (according to the critics). But in the meantime, I'm thrilled!",8.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
1812,B00A7F57EM,Matt Morgan,4,17-May-13,False,Elegant Device With A Few Quirks,"I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago... The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end. Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones. It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround. Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned. As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now. There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share. The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",2.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 822 16GB Windows Phone Black - Verizon,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Windows-Phone-Black/dp/B00A7F57EM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxGoYUWTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A7F57EM,62,204.16,0.0
22328,B07N11SM58,Achint,4,17-Mar-19,True,I love this phone but you might not,"Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I feel that this phone is going to get a lot of polarized opinions as this phone packs some punch in the camera department but it might not be what people will expect. The main highlight of this phone is its 5 cameras and this might sound better than other flagship phones which have 2 or 3 cameras, but this phone's cameras are used in an entirely different way than the other phones (more on that later.) While most of the other phones process the picture after taking the picture e.g. they will enhance the contrast or details, this phone does not process the image in a similar way. The traditional image processing is kept at a minimum because that control is given to the user. I have found that with my earlier phone colors in the pictures were way more saturated than in real life. This has been a gripe for some of the photographers who use the phone to take a picture and find that the phone image processing has cranked the image attributes too high for their liking, so they prefer to shoot in RAW which lets them be in control. This phone seems to be aimed at doing that and gives control to the user to decide how they want their picture to look like. This might sound a good idea but most of the people don't want that much finer control and are fine with what their phone cranks out. So while comparing stock pictures of a brightly lit scene from this phone and other phones, you might find this phone takes dull pictures while others have eye-popping colors and might end up in thinking that camera on this phone is not good. This phone is a photographer's phone who loves to tinker and play around with their images. If you think you are that kind of person then this phone is for you. Of course, the camera on this phone has several other huge advantages over other phones as well (and not just the picture processing controls) which I have covered below. But let's start with the basic specification of this phone OS: Android 9.0 a.k.a. Android Pie (certified under Android One program) Chipset: Snapdragon 845 GPU: Adreno 630 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128 GB Rear cameras: 5 cameras with each camera being 12 MP, f/1.8, 28mm. Of the 5 cameras, 2 are RGB camera, 3 are B/W cameras, and one TOF (Time of flight sensor.) More on cameras below. Front camera: 20 MP. Video recording: Rear camera is capable of recording at 2160p@30fps (4K), 1080p@30fps (Full HD). You can also record videos in 4K UHD. Screen Size: 5.99 inches Screen resolution: 1440 x 2880 pixels with 538 PPI. Screen type: POLED (Plastic AMOLED, more on that later) Screen protection: Gorilla glass 5. Authentication technologies: in-display fingerprint reader, Face Unlock Charging: Quick Charge 3.0 (Fast battery charging 18W), Qi (Fast Wireless charging 10W) Battery: 3320mAh. For me, it lasts more than a day. I don't watch many videos on this phone and my calls on the phone is limited to 15-20 minutes a day. Other features: HDR support NFC support IP67 water resistance rating (can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes) USB-C port MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS PHONE BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE 1. For a phone that is marketed as a photographer's phone, the phone's camera app needs considerable work. Launching the app, changing the app mode (e.g. between slow motion, video, bokeh mode) is terribly slow. The camera app glitches out often by giving error ""Unable to connect of the camera"". I missed a couple of opportunities to take a picture because the camera app took too long to open. I am hoping the camera app would get updated to fix these issues. Patience is going to be the key while dealing with the camera app on this phone. 2. The fingerprint sensor is very glitchy. It doesn't work more than half of the time and keeps prompting to press the glass harder. This is an inherent problem with these optical-based fingerprint sensors, instead of newer phones that come with ultrasonic based fingerprint sensors that are more accurate. The in-screen sensor is also slower than the capacitive based optical sensors found on other phones e.g. iPhones, and Pixel phones. However, the face unlock feature of this phone really great and I rarely have to use the fingerprint unlock most of the times, but when the fingerprint authentication is used for authentication in apps, it can be really annoying that you might have to try 5-10 times for the app to recognize the fingerprint. HMD has said that there will be a software update to address this but I doubt that even that will make much difference. I would highly recommend enabling the face-unlock feature as it works quite beautifully. 3. The automatic brightness adjustment seems to be little sluggish. On my Lumia 950XL, I could see the brightness change between different lighting conditions, but the automatic brightness control on this phone doesn't seem to be that sensitive. The display is beautiful and I can read clearly in sunlight. But sometimes when I am in direct sunlight the phone doesn't adjust the brightness or it takes noticeably longer to adjust the screen brightness. 4. You can take the pictures quickly with this camera but it processes all the information of the picture in the background and that can take a significant amount of time (between 5-10 seconds.) You can continue to take pictures while processing of pictures is going on, but if you want to go back and take a look at the picture immediately, then you would have to wait. 5. The build of this phone is good but is in no way a head turner. The top and bottom bezels clearly scream of a mid-range smartphone. But then given the price of this phone, a bezel-less design for the screen might be too much to ask for. GOOD THINGS 1. The Android updates are fast. This phone got the March update in March, and the only other phones that have this update is Pixel and Essential phones. 2. The face-unlock feature works well. Most of the time it would unlock the phone before I could even reach for the fingerprint authentication. Though it doesn't seem to work in dark or low light conditions, which would need an IR scanner. 3. I love all the tweaking and picture controls on the phone. If you are shooting in bokeh mode then one more option ""Color pop"" shows up for the photo which mutes the color around the subject you want to focus on bringing out the colors of the subject. 4. Even though this phone does not have a dedicated camera button, you can still press the power/lock button two times to launch the camera app (this works even if the phone is locked.) Once in the camera app, you can press the volume button (either volume up or down) to take a picture. THINGS YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE 1. This phone produces what is being called as ""Natural looking pictures"". You would want to tweak the pictures with the editing tools provided in this phone to get better-looking pictures. I love playing around with the color contrast, light, depth settings, but if you are taking dozens of pictures of a trip then it might not be possible to tweak each picture manually. 2. This phone has 5 cameras which do provide a different and better picture. However, for video only one camera (RB one) is used. This is mainly because handling video information from 5 different cameras would have been overwhelming for the phone's hardware. 3. There is no headphone jack. This is the biggest thing I miss in this phone. Although there is a USB C to headphone jack adapter provided, I still feel that it wouldn't compensate for a missing headphone jack. 4. Last year's chipset i.e. Snapdragon 845. This may not be a huge deal (more on this topic below) 5. No external sd card expansion slot. A common missing feature these days. 6. No OIS (but it has EIS, what's the difference? more on this topic below) 7. No video recording at 60 fps. 8. Non-removable battery (again a standard missing feature with the most phone these days) 9. No color options, just midnight blue ... but if you are using a case on it then it won't be an issue. 10. No IR blaster 11. No Radio WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH 5 CAMERAS This phone utilizes its 5 cameras differently. Most of the phones have multiple cameras of different focal lengths. For instance, Samsung Galaxy S10 has 3 cameras: regular camera, ultrawide angle camera, and telephoto (zoom) camera. If the user tries to zoom in while taking a picture the telephoto lens will kick in, zooming out utilizes the ultrawide camera. So only one camera is being utilized depending upon how much the user wants to zoom into the scene. This is a way for the phone to provide zoom functionality with the lens/camera a.k.a. optical zoom instead of simulating it in software a.k.a. digital zoom. Nokia PureView's 5 camera system works in a very different way. All 5 cameras take a picture at the same time but they collect different type of information about the scene. When a picture is taken the 2 RGB cameras and 3 monochrome cameras take a picture at the same time and collect more information about the scene. RGB cameras usually capture color information about the scene by selectively blocking out light (e.g. the Red pixel on the sensor of RGB camera would block out everything but Red light to determine how much red light is being generated at a particular spot in the scene.) Monochrome (or Black and White) cameras do not block light selectively and thus capture the intensity of light. So they can capture more detail. Nokia Pureview's camera then combines all the information from 5 cameras into one picture and produces a single picture. This process is called image stacking as we are piling up the information of all images on top of each other. Image stacking is not new in smartphone cameras. The Pixel phones use image stacking in one of their features called Night Sight which provides better pictures in low light. Pixel's camera takes 15 photos with different exposure level and stacks them together. But since Pixel has a single camera it has to take the photos one after the other and then compensate for movement of the object or the camera in software. However, since PureView's has multiple cameras so it takes a picture at the same time and image stacking should be relatively better in these. Also, because of the monochrome cameras, you can take Black and White photos natively in camera instead of taking colored pictures and then converting them to black and white. The only advantage of using a monochrome camera is that it is able to capture much more detail than converting a colored picture to black and white. Also, you can shoot in depth mode or bokeh mode (as mentioned in the camera app of this phone) to produce a bokeh effect. Bokeh effect is basically having one object sharp and in focus while the background is blurred. This is quite handy for taking portrait pictures of an object, person, or food which is usually in focus while the background is blurred. You can take a picture in depth mode which will make Pureview's camera can depth information of the scene. This phone has ToF (Time of flight) sensor which can determine the depth of the objects in the scene and can take collect depth information for 1200 layers. More depth means a more gradual and more realistic blurring of the background. Pixel phone, for example, contains only two layers of information which are the subject and the background. The background is blurred equally in Pixel's phone while with PureView's camera you can have a gradual blur effect since it captures so much information about the scene. After the picture is taken, you can then move the focus point to wherever you like and background will be blurred to your liking. If you shoot a picture in bokeh mode then you can apply ""Color pop"" filter to the picture as well which mutes the color of objects surrounding the focused object. You can also install Adobe Lightroom during the setup process and HMD has worked with Adobe to provide a custom profile for the Pureview's lens. WHAT IS THE TALK OF THIS PHONE BEING LAST GEN The latest trend of mobile phones in 2018 and 2019 is the bezel-less design with edge to edge screens. PureView 9 has bezels on the top and bottom of the screen. These are not too distracting and I personally am comfortable with this. The problem with an edge to edge screens is that the screen needs to accommodate the front-facing cameras and the slot of the earpiece, so manufacturers have to resort to solutions like notches and punch hole designs in the screen. This phone also has Snapdragon 845 chipset which is considered to be a 2018 year model while all the latest phones coming up with Snapdragon 855. The Snapdragon chipset has a limitation of only being able to use only 2 cameras at the same time, so HMD was working with Light company to interface their processor called Lux-Capacitor with Snapdragon chipset. This took effort and time on their part and this phone was delayed. The result is this phone is released in early 2019 with an older chipset. The main differences between Snapdragon 845 and 855 are: 1. Snapdragon 855 offers better performance (graphics performance, app launch etc) 2. Snapdragon 855 has better support for AI assistants (e.g. Alexa, Cortana, Google voice assistants) 3. Snapdragon 855 supports 5G (sort-of) For me, these differences were not significant enough to make a difference, but if you use a lot of graphics intensive applications or games then you might get better performance from a phone that has Snapdragon 855 chipset e.g. Samsung Galaxy S10, OnePlus 5G. Other than the chipset being old the in display fingerprint reader is optical instead of ultrasonic as the one used in Samsung Galaxy S10. Optical fingerprint readers are slower and less accurate. This is another issue with this phone that the finger scanner is borderline useless sometimes. Also, this phone uses Gorilla glass 5 instead of Gorilla glass 6 which is used in Samsung Galaxy S10. But all in all, I felt the price difference between this phone and the other ""better"" flagship phones justified the configuration of this phone. WHAT IS ANDROID ONE Android One is a program by Google under which phones manufacturers install a non-modified version of Andoird operating system on the phone. Several of the manufacturers install their own UI over Android e.g. Samsung phones install OneUI on their phones, while Huaweiâ€™s phone has EMUI OS. In addition to that some manufacturer's install their own apps e.g. Samsung phones come pre-installed with apps such as Bixby, Galaxy Store, Samsung+ some of which may not even be removed. Some of these modifications bring refreshing changes e.g. Samsun's OneUI provides a system-wide dark theme, ability to change system fonts which Android lacks natively. But some people find these apps to be annoying and slowing down their system, and these customizations are often referred to as bloatware. Another effect of these manufacturer's customizations is that when a new version of OS is released, manufacturers have to test their apps and their UI before releasing the update to their phones. This usually updates to these phones get delayed from weeks to months. Under the Android One program, manufacturer's agree that there would be no customizations on their part. This means that the phones certified under Android One program get faster updates. Also, phones under Android One programs are guaranteed to receive OS update for 2 years and security updates for 3 years. Android One phone also manages background apps so that battery drain is kept to a minimum. Android Pie is the version of the Android operating system that is installed on this phone under the Android One program. DOES IT MATTER IF THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE OIS This phone doesn't have the OIS (optical image stabilization) which is present in most of the flagships phones these days. Instead, this phone contains Electronic Image stabilization (EIS) which is present in medium price range phones. Both of these OIS and EIS provide image stabilization i.e. they correct the sudden movement/shake of the camera hands while taking a picture or video to avoid the blurry or smudge effect. OIS does this by having extra hardware (floating lens element) in front of the camera lens to compensate for the movement of the phone while taking a picture or making a video. You might even see a bump in the camera for the phones that use OIS (but not always the case.) EIS, on the other hand, does the image stabilization entirely in software by applying algorithms to the video by looking at multiple frames of the video or using sensors and gyroscopes in the phone to determine the shake of the camera and adjusting the picture/video accordingly. Since EIS is done entirely in software and uses sensors/hardware that is usually present in the phone so phones with EIS tend to be cheaper to keep the price down. OIS seems to have an upper hand in taking pictures in low light conditions where they allow the lens to be open longer for collecting light. But for photography in general light conditions, EIS and OIS should be on par with each other. I made videos with my Lumia 950 XL (which has OIS) and Pureview 9, and I found the stabilization to be par with each other. WHAT IS pAMOLED pAMOLED, that stands for Plastic Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode, is another type of screen being used today in phones (other being LCD.) OLED is the component of the screen that generates the light and colors in the screen. It comprises of a sheet/sheets that are made of an organic compound (i.e. containing carbon.) OLED screen can be controlled either through a passive or active matrix control scheme. In a passive matrix configuration, power is provided to each row of pixels in the OLED sheet, while in an active matrix configuration each pixel can be powered and controlled individually using a control matrix of transistors. Passive matrix is cheap but requires higher voltage as the size of the pixel row increases i.e. the resolution of screen increases. The various components of the screen such as the transistor control matrix, anode, a cathode are on a base layer (called a substrate.) The substrate layer can be made of plastic or glass. In this case, the substrate is made of plastic. All of the phones that use OLED use Active matrix configuration since Passive matrix configuration becomes difficult to manage for higher resolution screens. The plastic substrate allows for thinner screen panels as the plastic substrate layer is comparatively thinner and flexible than a glass substrate layer making it more suitable for curved screens such as Samsung galaxy edge phones. OLED screens provide more contrasts and deeper blacks than LCD (since in OLED individual pixel can be turned off) and are catching up with LCD screens in popularity as their cost becomes less. Samsung, LG, BOE seem to be the biggest manufacturers of OLED screens right now. IS THIS PHONE BY NOKIA OR HMD GLOBAL Nokia had sold its mobile division to Microsoft. Under this deal, Nokia could not return to Mobile business until 2015. Once 2015 arrived and Nokia could enter the mobile business again, instead of creating their own mobile phones again Nokia licensed their brand name to HMD global company. HMD global also acquired the licensing rights for the PureView brand in August 2018. Even though HMD global is not the same company as Nokia many of the key people in HMD global are former employees of Nokia e.g. the CEO of HMD global Florian Seiche, COO of HMD global Pia Kantola, CFO of HMD global Anssi RÃ¶nnemaa used to work at Nokia.",280.0,Nokia,"Nokia 9 PureView - Android 9.0 Pie - 128 GB - Single Sim Unlocked Smartphone (at&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/H2O) - 5.99"" QHD+ Screen - Qi Wireless Charging - Midnight Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-PureView-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07N11SM58,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ls1kpJJsL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N11SM58,61,499.99,699.0

2278,B00CQAODG4,Alan G.,5,17-Jun-13,False,Very Impressed! Left iPhone and Haven't Missed It.,"A few weeks ago, and I upgraded from the iPhone 4 to the Nokia 928. I thought I would regret it within a matter of days, but I'm really surprised at how much I don't even miss the iPhone. The Nokia 928 has everything I need and it's really enjoyable to use. Plus, it has a some features the iPhone didn't - like a super high quality camera, wireless charging and live tiles on the home screen. The WP8 software is really fast, intuitive and easy to look at. By comparison, the iPhone now seems lackluster and in need of a refresh, but Apple's been slow to show us something new. Seems like Microsoft and Nokia have been working very hard on this one and it really shows. Great job. Great prices right now too! Other Pros: -Calls are loud and clear. -Screen is big, clear and vibrant. -Great flow. Moving around is fast and buttery smooth - no hesitation or hiccups. -White text on black background makes reading email and menus very easy on the eyes. -If you have a Mac, you can sync iTunes, iPhoto, etc. -Camera performance rivals a very good compact camera. Close-up mode is absolutely incredible. -Live tiles are useful and customizable. No more hunting through tiny same-sized squares for an app. -App selection is sufficient. I'm not an app fanatic; they have all the major ones I want. -Tight integration across phone. For example: if you open a contact, you can view recent emails, text messages, social media updates and photos right from within their profile and not have to open separate apps like Messaging, Facebook or Twitter. Some Cons: -Headphones not included. -Wireless charger not included (only a wall charger) so it costs extra to take advantage of this feature. -Phone is slightly larger and heavier than I wanted. This is actually a pro when using it as a camera. -Camera settings are not quick to get at -there's no hidden overlay you can quickly pull up- so unless you use Auto mode all the time, you always have to tap the menus to change settings . Also, some backlit shooting situations can be a little tricky if you don't practice. -No audio streaming that I know of (like Apple's Airplay) . Not really a big deal to me tho.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0
2312,B00CQAODG4,Stephen Morris,4,17-Jun-13,True,Replaced my Android Phone,"I was unhappy with the battery life on my Galazy Nexus (Verizon) and decided to switch to a Windows Phone to try out the interface. I really like the tile interface on the phone form factor. I mostly text and read emails on my phone but the tiles make it easy to get updates on scores and news events. The interface is very intuitive and most functions can be completed with just a thumb. Battery life has been outstanding so far. I used to turn off 4G on my old phone to preserve battery but so far I have left it on with the Lumia 928 and easily get a full day of mixed usage. The one thing I thought I would miss from Android is the lack of LED alerting. I like to keep my ringer off and get notification of new email, appointment, text or phonecall based on the color LED. This phone doesn't have that feature, however I am not missing it as much as I expected. I generally leave the alerts on low volumne and they are sufficient to have me check my messages without being overly intrusive to those around me. The integration with Skydrive for the camera app is a nice feature that automatically backs up you photos to the cloud. I was surprised that my favorites from IE on my desktop didn't sync like they would to my Surface tablet but I have missed this less than I thought because of the live tiles. I suspect this feature will be added in the future. Overall I'm happy with the switch from Android and this platform seems to be a better fit for the way I use a phone.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

2268,B00CQAODG4,D. Grieco Jr.,5,17-Jun-13,False,Bye bye Android... I won't miss you...,"I've had two Android smartphones in the past... 1) The original Motorola Droid & 2) The Droid Bionic. Here's the stuff about Droid that drove me to Windows Phone 8... **Battery life - crazy bad to the point where I had to install the extended battery and cover (also true of my friend's Samsung phones). **Connection issues - 4G showing up in the display and the phone telling me during a navigation session ""Data Connection Lost"". Really? I'm navigating somewhere... now what? **Random reboots - Oh yeah, never during a call but I'd be in the middle of web browsing session only to have the phone reboot itself. **Browser crashes - happened all the time. **4G to WiFi to 4G transition - a nightmare. I'd have to turn off WiFi, wait a couple of seconds, and then turn it back on. **Bloatware and the inability to delete Verizon apps. There were a LOT of unused apps, taking up space, that I would have loved to delete if I could. **Cost - $299 w/2-year contract renewal. Comparison to the Nokia 928 **Battery life - you can't change the battery but you really don't have to. It lasts all day with power to spare **Connection issues - there are none. **Random reboots - never happens. As a matter of fact, I haven't had to manually reboot this phone for any reason whatsoever. **Browser crashes - none **4G to WiFi to 4G transitions - smooth as anything - there's no interruption in the data flow. **Bloatware - I actually LIKE the apps that came with this phone especially Nokia Drive, HERE Maps, HERE City Lens, and all the Nokia photo apps. The one ""already installed"" app I wouldn't use, ESPN, was easily erased. **Cost - $99 w/2-year contract renewal. Notable features of the 928 & Windows Phone 8... Beautiful display Easy OS - One screen for shortcuts (tiles) and one screen that lists ALL the programs. Great camera - pretty good low light photos, beautiful daytime photos, and a bunch of creative photo apps from Nokia that are fun and impressive Call quality - very good; no complaints Processor speed - very smooth; no lag Live tiles - not the ""nightmare"" that I've heard of... some are kind of cool, some are functional. All in all a nice feature to have. Navigation - works without an active data connection (map file is pre-installed). Apps - This seems to be a huge issue for some people. Are there less apps available for WP8?, yes. Do I care?, not really. Why?, there really hasn't been an app that I wanted I couldn't find, or find an acceptable substitute. I have Facebook, Skype, Open Table, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc. More apps are being made available daily. I found a decent tip calculator, a Drop-Box & You-Mail interface that's fully functional, and a bunch of games. I know there's a zillion apps for Android and Apple IOS, but most of them are crappy or repetitive (how many flashlight apps do you need anyway?). Oh by the way, all the apps I downloaded and installed were freebies. Thing I don't like about the phone... **Volume control... there's seems to be one control that affects everything (ringer, notifications, alarm, media, etc.) A minor annoyance, but I would like to have more controls. **No FoxFi (I didn't use free WiFi tethering THAT often, but now I'll have to deal with its absence). Conclusion... I don't miss the Android OS at all. There were too many issues with it for me to continue using it. I was waiting for this phone to come out on Verizon and I'm glad I did. It's not perfect, but it works really well. Even though there are less apps than Android, they seem to be better written (more polished, more functionality, etc.) and there hasn't been anything I needed or wanted that I couldn't find. I can't believe I got this newly released phone for $99. If you're in the market for a new phone, don't listen to the FANatics, think for yourself, and take a good look at this phone.",18.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

Not quite used to it at the very beginning because the stock android does not come with too many apps, but that is exactly why I love this phone--bloatware free. Very responsive, no lagging. Have a little bit issue when the system was first updated, but it was running fine after reset. Some of the reviews said they have problems with wifi, but many others pointed out that the problem could be fixed by just resetting the router. Didn't experience that issue personally, but resetting the router is not too difficult, just a botton, right? Some are even more funny to compare the camera and the cpu with the flagships of other brand. Come up, this is only a $230 cell phone. What can be expected? The phone is definitely not as slow as some reviews claimed. Camera is ok ( in fact very good for this price).

2360,B00CQAODG4,T. R. Boomer,5,17-Jul-14,False,This is THE absolute best phone I have ever had,"I bought a new one in an auction on EBay. The bottom line: This is THE absolute best phone I have ever had. I switched from Android to Windows and wow I am SOOOOO much happier now. The windows phone makes sense to me because I can close apps very easily which returns memory back to the OS to use for whatever. It basically frees up memory. Android just seems to eat up memory because most apps won't close. So the more you open the slower the android os runs. Not so here. Everything flows very smoothly and intuitively. No hesitation; no waiting; just bang instant results. Windows Phone has really won me over because office 365 is included with the phone. I can sync it with my corporate Exchange mail system and open attachments with MS Office or Adobe Acrobate Reader just like I do on my desktop computer. If you have been using Windows for years I think you will feel right at home with this phone. Nokia has put EXTREME quality and care into this phone. It is very thin and light, yet it sports a 4.5 inch screen with a very high contrast ratio. Perhaps the best part is the picture taking ability. Windows Store shows a special section called Nokia Apps that are only available to Nokia phones. They let you do panoramas easily, and selfies really easily. They enhance focus and zoom and really allow you to take advantage of the extremely fine photographic abilities. The selfie app waits until you are in position and then automatically takes your picture from the lens on the back side of the phone. More and more apps are moving from Android to Windows phone. They run better on Windows. In the past, there has been a shortage of apps on Windows Phone but that has DRASTICALLY changed. In the last year, there has been an explosion of new apps on Windows Phone, partly owing to Windows 8 tablets. At the present moment I have been able to find a huge amount of applications for everything. I cannot always get the same app, like I can get Sports Tracker but I cannot get Radar Now. However, I found MyRadar which does the same thing as Radar Now on the Android. I love this phone. It is the bomb! It took me a few days to learn my way around but after a week with this phone I am extremely pleased. It is the best experience I have EVER had with a smart phone.

WiFi is an essential function for a smartphone to have. While the phone is sleek, I do not just want a sleek phone to look at, I need a device that is functional and productive.

15461,B075FL4H89,Mac Racer,4,17-Feb-18,False,it is a remarkable good feature phone,"While this retro 3310 is more of a PR stunt for the new Nokia than anything else, it is a remarkable good feature phone. I grew up using various feature phones and this one is the best so far. When my smartphone broke the other week I started using this one 24/7 until I can get my other phone replaced. This new 3310 3G has plenty of useful features, decent voice call quality, long standby, and it even can connect to the proper internet if absolutely necessary. It even can stream Youtube videos. Now, while the latter two are really not something this phone was designed for, it‘s nevertheless remarkable. A quick glance at news headlines, sports scores, etc. is doable. Best you bookmark your favorite webpages in order to not have them to type in all the time. Also, a simple mail client for Gmail and Yahoo Mail can be downloaded for free from the app store. Again, while this is a rather tedious affair to check mails regularly, it can save your day if in an emergency this were the only way to communicate via email (having suffered weeks without proper power after a natural disaster, I know what it means to not be able to connect to email and internet at all). The simplicity of this phone does make it great for conducting phone calls, one handed use to unlock and initiate calls, etc. Texting is a different story.

1603,B00A2V7BA4,Adam B,5,17-Feb-13,False,Updated Review 3/3/2013 - My Lumia is running perfect now,"See the updates under my original review. Original review: The Lumia 920 is a great smartphone. The tiles can be resized and moved so it was easy to customize my start screen to suit my needs. I like getting updated information from the live tiles. I hope more apps are developed to take full advantage of the live tiles. I plan on getting one for my mother because her bad eyes can easily see the medium resized tiles on the OS. The camera takes very clear pictures most of the time and there are camera apps that add more functions to the camera like multishoot and panorama. There aren't a lot of camera settings but there are enough for most users. The wi-fi is able to pick up signals from most of my neighbors and our houses have a good bit of space between them. The wi-fi signal in my 920 is stronger than my desktop's wired connection. Speedtest shows my 920 getting 3 times the speed of my wired desktop connection at the same distance from the router. Having access to all my documents and mobile MS Office on my phone is very useful. I can just load my documents onto a skydrive and access them anywhere and on any of my devices. I have my skydrive loaded with my SNES games, school documents, and work documents. It's free but it's limited to 7GB total storage and files can't be above 2GB. The screen is large and displays images beautifully. I've watched a few movies on it and the large screen is a huge improvement over my other phones. The large screen also makes games easier to see and control. There are tons of apps in the app store. I spent hours looking at all the different apps. All the most useful apps were free and there were a lot of free games in the store too. My favorite app is the SNES emulator. I'm enjoying playing all my old super nintendo games again. I'm very happy with my purchase. 1/31/2013 - Update: Avoid Battery Apps I began having problems with my Lumia 920 freezing, overheating, and the battery draining a little faster than usual. After reading similar problems and solutions I was able to elminate those problems by uninstalling a battery app that I downloaded from the app store. Battery apps don't come preloaded on the phone. It's best to avoid them so they don't cause problems. 2/17/2013 - Update: Constant Crashing I'm having problems with my Lumia 920 again. It's constantly locking up and forcing me to reset it. There are many apps that can cause problems so I disabled all of them. I also disabled the built in automatic clock updates because it can cause the Lumia 920 to crash. After about 10 mintues of playing any game on the phone it crashes, even when background apps, bluetooth, and auto clock updates are all disabled. It also gets very hot. I've tried to play games with my protective case off to see if that was causing it to overheat and crash, that didn't help. I regret buying this phone now. I paid full price through Amazon Wireless so it was a very expensive mistake. The constant crashing is the only thing I don't like about the phone. If you don't play games or use apps then this phone would be a good choice. If you use apps and play games on your phone then you should avoid the Lumia 920. Consider a different model Lumia or a Windows phone from a different manufacturer. 3/3/2013 - Update: My Lumia 920 is running perfect now After uninstalling more apps and updating everything my Lumia 920 is finally running without crashing. I think my problems were fixed by the new HERE Drive, HERE City Lense, HERE Maps, and HERE Transit apps that replaced the old versions. I've been adding apps back onto the phone and I've been using it a lot more than usual for testing purposes and it's running smooth. Now I can recommend this phone to my friends and family.

20690,B07HD3QC65,Chase,4,17-Dec-18,True,"Great mid-range, affordable phone","I've had the phone for just under a month and have really enjoyed my first Nokia device since 2002 or so. Coming from a Nexus 5X that was basically a ticking bomb, I was waiting for a decent mid-range phone to take up the Nexus mantle of well-spec'd, affordable devices as I refuse to pay more than $450 for a cell phone. The 7.1 hits the mark and is a fantastic replacement. There are a couple things that I had not known or noticed before the purchase but they've amounted to minor inconveniences. There is no notification light on the front like most phones. The rear fingerprint sensor is quite flush with the back and sometimes hard to find right away. In comparison, the 5X's was marked by a ring around the sensor and was easy to find. However this is fixed easily with a case. There's also no optical zoom on the camera and while it takes fantastic photo and video, it's a bit annoying to not have this. This is my first Android One phone and it's nearly identical to the OS of a Pixel/Nexus phone. My complaints with Pie are specific to the update, not the phone itself. Call audio is clear and the dual SIM/expandable memory is useful. It looks and feels like a premium device without the massive price tag. The battery lasts well over a day for me with moderate use.

1818,B00A7F57EM,Chris,1,17-Dec-13,False,A real review from a real person,"This phone is absolute junk. From the first day I got it from Verizon I've had NOTHING but problems. I've had androids that were better than this useless phone. You would think that if the two greatest tech companies in the world (Nokia and Microsoft) teamed up to make a phone, it would be something of top quality but this isn't the case unfortunately. I've had so many issues with this phone that I had to call Verizon to get a new one..and the new one was EXACTLY the same..im not even going to waste my time calling them again because im so done with verizon and im done with windows phones. These phones are like this straight from the factory because of improper testing by Microsoft, improper testing by Nokia and worst of all...verizon for not intervening when its in their best interest to provide their customers with good phones..because after all....its a telecom company..thats what they do. I am dissapointed with these reviews as well..either they're fake or people just dont know how to review a product or what a review even is. You're supposed to evaluate a product thoroughly before judging it. Everything seems nice when its new but when you have it for more than a year like me then you begin to see why it deserves one single star and nothing more. I came to windows from several androids because I got tired of all the bugs and unreliability that android devices have..also the fact that the phone looked incredibly gorgeous in the store and on YouTube. I can now say this is probably the worst operating system out of all 3 (android, apple, msoft) For crying out loud they dont even have proper apps like a fully functioning browser, a non browser based YouTube app that actually works, a chat app not even a proper video chat app. Everything is garbage.. - phone shuts off at random times once a week - the microphone doesn't function when pressed against your ear and no one can hear you..because for some odd reason the mic is at the earpeace - the back cover is paper thin and the phone is hard to assemble if you need to take the sim out or access the battery compartment - GPS is literally useless unless you want to be taken to a random location you didn't ask for ( happened to me a lot of times) unfortunately nokia thought it was a good idea to block their customers from using the only functioning maps app available..which is google maps..because they have a stupid partnership with windows..so now I have to use a map app that doesn't work - Browser closes by itself..the back button doesn't take you back to the last page you've visited - phone has problems loading images in the browser - problems loading webpages - silent mode isn't silent mode at all, its vibrate mode, loud mode doesn't have the option to turn off vibration - apps close by themselves daily - phone locks up for a few seconds at a time - the app store has probably 1/10th the amount of apps that android does - contact transfer to windows live doesn't work (I've lost so many numbers after I got a replacement for this phone from Verizon - after turning flash off on the camera phone the flash still flashes - highlighting individual words isn't accurate..the phone highlights the complete sentence instead - messages sometimes dont get through - Bing sucks - battery life is really bad - the phone wasn't properly tested - this is my last windows phone On a positive note the phone is extremely rugged.

1800,B00A7F57EM,liverdonor,4,17-Dec-12,False,"An excellent phone, especially for Microsoft Office users.","I purchased a grey 822 from the Verizon store on November 9th (sorry, Amazon - couldn't find it on your site). Nonetheless - this phone has some excellent features, and a few nits. Pro: As has been mentioned, the screen is nice. Surprisingly, you can read it outdoors although direct sunlight reduces visibility somewhat. Pro: Real, honest-to-God Microsoft Office applications - not knockoffs. I've even edited Powerpoint presentations on the way to meetings, with no problems. Pro: RF. I have owned cellular phones, both dumb and smart, since 1992. Sometimes the radios are good, and sometimes you can't hold onto a session to save your life. Out of all the smartphones I've used (including Motorola, who normally makes great radios), this has one of the best. I get reception in places my wife's feature phone can't even pick up one RSSI bar and my older iPhone 4 can't get any reception at all. A fine radio. Can't wait to try it out overseas and see how the HSPA radio works! Pro: Bluetooth 3.0. Very good performance with all my BT devices (including my boat's BT navigation equipment). Con: Bluetooth profiles missing. Why, oh why, didn't Nokia include the HID profile? iPhone and the higher-end Android phones have it, and it's really handy to be able to whip out a BT keyboard to edit some documents. Con: So, Microsoft - where the heck is VPN support? This is easily the biggest complaint I have. I NEED VPN support to connect to machines in my office and monitor builds, perform IT support etc. As it is, I have to kludge by with using WiFi connection sharing and hooking through with my laptop, which is slow and lame and uses up my precious GBs. I have heard rumors that MSFT may include it in Apollo+ (or WP8.1 or whatever they're calling it). We'll just have to wait and see, but that was a big mistake, IMHO. Pro: I concur with previous reviewers on the Nokia apps. They are, for the most part, excellent - especially the ""offline map"" mode in the Drive and Maps applications. Tested by driving all over the lower mainland (British Columbia, Canada for those of you who don't know it), in offline mode and never got lost. Con: Another nit is the lack of connection between the Favorites in the Maps application and the Drive application. One would think you could store a Maps fave and have it show up in the Drive app, but no dice. I had to do everything twice. Annoying. Pro: Audio quality, especially over A2DP (stereo Bluetooth) connection. I play through my BT-enabled receiver and it sounds awesome - especially high-quality rips of discs I own. Who needs an iPod or other player anymore? Summary - a little over one month in, I still like this phone very much and find it a lot easier to use than Android and generally smoother flow than Apple's iOS. If any of you are software folks, you'd appreciate that this OS's design seems to have taken a lesson from this book The Inmates Are Running the Asylum - almost all of my most common tasks are very easy to accomplish with very few gestures/keystrokes.

Others have talked about the device, so I figure I'll provide some tips to new Lumia users (cool things I found): Apps - going to sound like a Nokia commercial, but these are the ones I use most: * Smartshoot - takes several photos in succession and lets you EASILY pick / choose the best bits of each to make one good photo * Cinemagraph - Take a short video and animate certain pieces of it while leaving the other parts still (youtube it) * Nokia Music - Free and ad-free, new music with offline access (no data charges). This must cost Nokia money, but who care, I paid for the phone * Nokia Drive+ - Free turn by turn voice guided GPS that uses the same maps as Garmin * Metrotube - Awesome Youtube app * Photobeamer - send a photo from your screen to any web enabled device - mindbendingly simple and one of those apps that you can't understand how it's not 'magic' Visual and music search - just hit the search button and then choose the eye - you can scan QR codes, bar codes, Microsoft tags etc. without an app. If you hit the 'musical note' icon, it will listen to a song and tell you the name, again, no app required Kids corner - allow your kids to bypass the lock on your phone but only get to their apps. Wireless charging - this is more awesome than you can imagine if you haven't used it. Skydrive - works like iCloud but is available on Android, Xbox, iphone and Windows 7 and 8.

3572,B00HWEMZ1E,Danny,4,17-Aug-16,True,4 Stars for Windows Phone,"I went from the Galaxy Note 2 to this Lumia Icon. Switching platforms can be a pain. Most people are so vested in one OS they are reluctant to change. I really like this Windows Phone. It came out of the box with Windows Phone 8.1 and now currently has Windows 10 Mobile. Though it is smaller than the Note 2 the screen is bright and vibrant with the resolution at 1080 x 1920. Even in the glare of the Sun the phone automatically adjusts for better visibility. The 20MP camera is fantastic. The camera has a rich motion view which show the pictures you just took in motion like you have just taken a very short video. It is a very welcome touch. The phone fits well in my hand the curved bottom feels perfect. The dedicated camera button is nice as well. Windows Phone is not for everyone. To many people care about the hot apps and games. I have used this phone for over a year and It's a very welcome change. No longer am I lost in useless apps and games. Instead I can stay productive with the array of very usefull Office apps. Even though FaceBook is on the Windows store use this platform has encouraged me to stop using FaceBook all together and trust me folks, it's a good thing. Give Windows Phone a shot. The hardware is just like those of Android and iPhones. The only difference between this platforms is with Windows Phone you don't have all that other bloat in the app store consuming your precious time.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0
2364,B00CQAODG4,Publicagent,5,17-Aug-13,False,Standout Phone / Initial Impressions / Windows 8,"Disclaimer: this is my first smartphone. I have a Google Nexus 7, and Apple laptop and desktop. So why would I get the Lumia 928? 1) It's the best reviewed phone on Verizon. 2) I like what I have seen of Windows 8 touchscreens. 3) I am impressed with Nokia's direction. 4) I wanted a high quality camera. 5) It's free. PHONE - It's difficult to separate the phone from the operating system, but I will try. First, call quality is outstanding. I had my clearest conversation ever on this phone. The speaker phone works great. The pictures are superb with nice editing options from Nokia. Personally I like the size/shape. It feels great in the hand, and can stand upright. Te screen is just large enough for e-reading, and comfortable enough for the pocket. In fact, I am very impressed with the screen. It really jumps out. HOME SCREEN - Beautifully done. The Windows tiling system is the best option out there. I enjoyed customizing my Nexus, but just picking and choosing where you put apps is not the same. Sizing the apps (only 3 options), placing them, and coloring them is fun and makes for a more enjoyable experience. On the downside, the tiles are unequal in live updates. Some provide them, some do not. Some update better than others. Still, what I see in front of me looks great, and gives me critical information. GOOGLE/APPLE USERS - I was initially concerned. There is a Windows Phone App for Mac. I downloaded it as the Getting Started pamphlet suggested. I uploaded iphotos and isongs to the phone, no problem. Gmail is my primary email. The phone tells me when I have new messages on the lockscreen, and my homescreen email tile. The interface when opening gmail is black and white, and it doesn't separate the promotions, updates, etc. into tabs. Basically it does what I need, minus the ads. Also, it logs threads. The simplicity is actually refreshing. Google Calender is my calendar. Although not as slick as on Android, it gets the job done. I don't see how to view the calendar weekly, but all of my upcoming appointments are listed under ""agenda"" for as far down as I can scroll. Daily appointments are visible on a homescreen calendar tile. APPS - There are lots of free apps for ereading (kindle looks great), audiobooks, photos, flashlights, social media, news, music, games, etc. The Windows App market is growing rapidly. I have found their selection to be more than adequate in almost all cases. For particular niches, in my case chess (semi-serious player), the app market can be too weak. A great thing about the lower selection is that it's easier to find cool apps that get buried elsewhere. For instance, I found a white noise sleeping app that I would have never looked up. There are far more apps than expected, and Nokia's own apps are an added bonus. WINDOWS 8/LUMIA 928 - It's absurd that some have said Windows 8 is not ready for prime-time. It's far from perfect, but it's fun, slick and improving fast. I have composed audio emails and texts flawlessly. I was able to download super cool free ringtones from the App store. Pandora has no ads! The settings could have more options, but they do the essentials. Having a basic free Office program is nice. Explorer reads differently depending on the page, but it's usually very clear. The back button works better than Android. The keyboard is solid. All apps are one swipe away. Did I mention my homescreen looks great? No crashes or stalls. OVERALL - I am very happy with this phone. I was hesitant to finally make the $30 a month jump to the smartphone world. Now I can't believe I waited so long. My camera, ipod, tablet and GPS have been subsumed into one device that is ridiculously underpriced. Why get bogged down by particular platforms? These days it's super-easy to jump from Apple to Android to Windows and back again. Windows 8 is a solid 4 stars on the mobile platform, and the Nokia Lumia 928 is a definite 5. There is a reason why the Verizon attendant said no one is returning with problems with this phone, whereas they regularly do for Android. Nokia has been in the phone-making business for a long time and it really shows. Windows 8 is contemporary, and will only get better. They make a standout combination. Why get what everyone else has? You will stand out with this phone. UDPATE: Love Nokia Music, the free version that comes with the phone. Audio commands work quite well. Photo editing has been fun. Tiles that update themselves are a huge perk. The Windows App store is growing by leaps and bounds.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

They hired Microsoft #2 person, who canned Nokia's in-house project, which was replaced by - you guessed it... Windows Phone!!! So, after a few years of terrible sales with WinPhone, Nokia switched to Android. But Android OTG is new and breaks (bricks) phones. Better is to check the implementation of updates on test units before these updates are released publicly. Android One presently still sucks!!! Be warned!!!

3632,B00HWEMZ1E,SewRusty,3,17-Apr-14,False,"Wanted to love it, but...","***Edited*** I thought I researched this phone as much as possible before buying, but clearly I didn't research enough because this phone simply isn't going to work for me. And here's why: 1. The ""incorrect password"" bug. It's something that seems to happen across all brands and models of Windows 8 phones, and if you can't fiddle around with the wifi for whatever reason, you are stuck using only the data plan on the phone. I can't get it to work on my wifi connection even though multiple computers and several other cell phones have no issue whatsoever with it. There are several threads on this at the Microsoft help website, and they all suggest trying to fiddle with the settings, and MAYBE it will work--if it can't just work like every other thing we've tried to hook up to it, it's probably not worth messing around with. I don't have the time or inclination to fuss with it. (Search WP8 won't connect to wifi on Microsoft's website) *Update* I finally got it to work with wifi, but it doesn't like my wifi hotspot (from another carrier). It's kind of hit or miss when it comes to hotspots, but seems to work fine on networks that use an actual router and/or don't have a password. I'm not going to pretend to understand it, that's just been how it has worked for me. 2. The bluetooth in my car worked just fine with my old ""dumb phone"" and works perfectly with my husband's iPhone. This phone simply won't play nice though. I can't get it to download the phone book so the convenience of ""hands free"" doesn't exist. The sound from it over the bluetooth fades in and out so it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the call. This appears to also be a known issue and there are threads about it on Microsoft's website dating back to 2012--if this hasn't been fixed yet, I wouldn't plan on it happening. (Search connect to car bluetooth on Microsoft's website) *Update* I got it to transfer my contacts--twice! If you can't get your contacts to transfer to your car, try having your phone book pulled up on your phone when you tell the car bluetooth to download your contacts. My old phone and the iPhone didn't require that, but it seems to be what is necessary to get the Icon and my car to ""talk"" to each other. It was either that or my dogged persistence that made it finally decide to work. 3. It's just kind of huge. You don't really know how a phone is going to feel until you've made a phone call with it--my hand started cramping up from holding it after about 10 minutes. If I can't use it to talk to grandma, there's no point in having a phone. And when I'm trying to drive? Fuhgeddaboudit. 4. The ringers aren't very loud or long. I need to be able to hear it ring from another room or over a crying baby (or sometimes both!) and this phone doesn't cut it. I've got the ringer maxed out and it's just not very loud; and whether it's laying face up or face down doesn't seem to make much difference either. The notifications for calendar events only ""ding"" at you once and then the notification just shows up on the screen until you hit snooze or dismiss. My old phone would raise holy heck until you told it that you got the memo--I miss that feature. 5. The support system. You can either post on Microsoft's website community (which if you do the above searches will show that there's a lot of frustrated users, but no real answers) or you can use Twitter. How they expect you to solve a problem over Twitter is beyond me. I'm pretty sure you get a new person every tweet and they ask you variations the same question over and over in an endless loop. And heaven help you if you have more than one issue!! Plus it's just such a long, drawn out process even if you have nothing else going on besides staring at your twitter feed all day. That being said, I'm really sad about returning it, because there are a lot of features that I love about it. 1. The camera. It's as phenomenal as everyone said it would be. Love. I'm not a photographer, but the camera takes such good pictures that I look like I might have a smidgen of talent. And the editing software is pretty awesome too, though I haven't played around with it as much. 2. Driving mode. It's probably weird, but I love that little feature. Even though I'm VERY anti-texting-and-driving, it's very hard to keep yourself from trying to find your phone when you hear the ""ding"". This way it just doesn't let the message dinger go off, so I can find out later. It also sends the person a text back saying I'm driving, so that they can call me if it's urgent...or at least in theory they could. 3. The OS is very easy to use. I came from a dumb phone and have had no trouble picking up the interface. I love the live tiles, though I wish there was a way to hover over to know for sure which icon is what without having to click on it--that's only because I'm still learning though, I doubt I'd need it after a couple of weeks. 4. The office suite that comes with it. I had intentions of buying a Surface Pro to go with this phone, but now I'm rethinking that. Maybe the tablet will still work well with whichever OS I end up with, but probably not as seamlessly as I was hoping. Still though, this phone would be awesome for someone who is serious about doing work. 5. Others have mentioned issues with the app store, but I found all the apps I needed there. The trick can be finding them. I had better luck going to the website on the phone (ie Twitter) and then getting directed to the app from there vs. searching. To me, the lack of games and flashlight apps were irrelevant though, because this is a phone that will be for making phone calls and doing work stuff instead of playing flappy bird. If you want a toy, buy a toy; if you want a work phone, buy this one (and then hope like heck you don't have the same issues I did!). 6. I really loved the responsiveness and clarity of the screen. I didn't need to tap anything multiple times to get it to work, and the picture is really clear even outside. And I suppose I'll mention here that I didn't know at first how to shut stuff off (I know, I know, RTFM already), so I had all kinds of programs open at one point and it never bogged down. Also, it has little videos you can watch that show how to use the phone, once I found those, they had some great tips on them like pressing and holding the ""back"" button to see what programs are open--which is how I discovered that I had a bunch of stuff open. 7. I really liked how intuitive the texting was--I mean, as big as the phone is it kind of has to be fairly good at guessing what you want to type or it would be a royal PITA, but it's really good. 8. This is pretty petty, but I just kind of liked being a rebel and having something different than the masses. I don't mind the the other OS's, but it seems like everyone and their dog has an iPhone or a GS3, and I hate doing/having what everyone else does. Overall, I'm torn on whether I would recommend this phone or not. Obviously, it isn't working out for me, but if those issues don't seem like dealbreakers to you (or you have more patience/time/tech savvy to make it work), you'll probably love it. It has a lot of little things that I loved, but the cons were pretty major to me. I'd give it 3.5 stars, but am sticking with 3 since we don't have halves.",18.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

They did think it would be cute to remove my screen protector and send me back the broken and useless screen protector, but sending my original box was too much. Very cute.

I thought it must be me simply being dense. And nobody at the store knew that it couldn't be done. But that's the case! My bad. I bought a Windows phone made by Nokia: the Lumia 900. Really ELEGANT. Very affordable. Sweet, except I can't read my email thru Apple on this device. It's like asking somebody for directions and being told ""you can't get there from here."" Seriously, in this modern era, for three computer giants (Microsoft, Nokia, Apple) and a major communications company (ATT) to sell phone/service which can't (won't!) receive email from a competitor is dumbfounding. There oughta be a law! After being told the situation by the very patient, intelligent, lovely people who persistently tried to help me at the store, I came home and called ATT just to verify that this disconnect was fact. The kind lady in phone support put me on hold and soon came back to tell me that, indeed, this was a definitive finding. And it holds for the 920, 925 and 1020 models, as well. Further research would seem to suggest that Apple is the fly in the ointment. So I've hit upon a solution. I will become my own email host. As I already own a domain name for my WordPress blog, thru Godaddy, I will begin using it as my primary email account, phasing out Apple. Hey, buying a Windows phone was a step away from being monopolized, and now Apple has pushed me one more down the path.

The battery life has declined so much that it does not last the whole day when data, bluetooth, wifi, and location are turned off and power saving mode is on. It is essentially unusable. I got this phone because it was cheap and I needed something, but it has lasted such a short time that I should have just paid twice the amount for something nicer and would've come out ahead. On top of this there have always been a myriad of other issues I was wiling to put up with for a crappy cheap phone for a year: The location feature is terrible and never knows where I am, which makes gps navigation impossible. The internal memory is so tiny that I couldn't fit just the UI on it, so I had to get a micro SD to use any apps. The phone is incapable of detecting and properly integrating the micro sd card, and thus continues to constantly complain of no memory space despite having nearly 100 free gigs. The ram is so limited that it can't run any standard modern applications, or even a couple tabs on any browser without being incredibly laggy. Many other little issues, but these were the main ones. As I said before; I knew what I was getting into getting a phone this old and cheap. If it weren't for it literally becoming unusable in less than half a year, I would've stuck with it for a year or two till I had enough to buy something decent.

Allen,5,16-Nov-12,False,I am absolutely in Love with my Lumia and Windows Phone 8.,"Every other review has covered all the big stuff so I recommend you read several of them, but let me tell you about the small stuff. They have changed the tell me network voice and have added a male voice. These now have a richer sound and more intonation than before, the network seems faster at processing the dictation and I would say I am noticing better accuracy. I use TellMe with a wired headset many, many times a day everyday and it has become an important part of how I get things done. Since I have my headset in all day long the ability for developers to use the TellMe API's in their apps is huge. I can use my voice to open apps and perform tasks in those apps. For example I can use my voice to open Audible and start my book playing without ever looking at my phone. Next their are some great improvements to texting in the phone. They now are not only predicting what word you are typing but what word you may intend to type next. I found this very useful and a pleasing surprise as I never saw this feature update get any press. Let me just cover the criticism of the weight I have seen out there, by saying it is not really an issue when compared to the feel of solidness you get when handling the phone. The phones screen is amazing I kept putting drops of water on it when I first got it to see if I could see pixels when magnified and I still could not. The speed of the screen really makes itself apparent when scrolling black text on a white back ground, there is no blur when the text is in motion. The camera is truly the sweet spot for me, I take a lot of photos and many of them indoors or in poor light and that is where this camera shines. And the ability to have images auto-upload to ShyDrive at full resolution is great. I will amend this as I spend more time with the phone. ***edit***01/23/13 I have spent more time with the phone and have now changed my rating to five stars.

1499,B00A2V7BA4,Wes &quot;Sunny Florida&quot; D,5,16-Nov-12,False,Excellent Device - Amazing Value,"I purchased the Nokia Lumia 920 in White at my local AT&T store. Coming from a Windows 7 and previously Android device, here's my review: Hardware: - Screen is bright, easy to read, and crystal clear. Gorilla glass doesn't smudge up like my prior phones. - Weight is not an issue - the phone feels substantial, which is a good thing. Fits perfectly in my hand to make a phone call. I also don't get the feeling that it will shatter if I drop it - 4G LTE is blazingly fast. Even on the standard ""4G"" network, the phone is much snappier than my previous devices - Screen size is just right for me; at 4.5"", plenty of real estate without being a ""note type"" device - Camera is amazing, quick to take pictures especially with the dedicated camera button - Battery life has been 1.5 days on average with moderate usage Software: Windows Phone 8 continues on with the familiar interface of WP7. Having previously owned an Android device, I find WP to be refreshing and easy to use. Tiles (called Live Tiles if they update automatically) present information in a fluid, easy to understand manner without being obtrusive. New to WP8, tiles can be resized small, medium, and large to give you just the amount of information you need. Apps can be pinned as tiles or accessed via the next screen (swipe right) to see a list of all phone apps. Now let's address the Apps. Lots of media sites make a big deal out of the lack of apps on Windows Phone 8. They said the same on WP7. But let's be realistic, I've owned the WP7 since it released in 2010 and never missed having a certain app. Also, given the number of quality apps that are being released this is a non-issue. Worst case, use the quick Internet Explorer 10 browser, which renders beautifully, BTW, to augment the app you need. Some might find it a deal-breaker - I find it to be an overblown non-issue. There have been some enhancements to the phone sync methods with a Windows 8 PC - I suspect that after a few teething issues, Microsoft will get this right and have the ability to move files and media around efficiently. At any rate, there is always SkyDrive which works great with music, photos, and Office documents.

1514,B00A2V7BA4,Doctj,4,16-Nov-12,False,Best smartphone for $100,"Bought this phone for my son and have used it extensively while ahem ""testing"" it for him. We've both used webOS for the last two years. I've most recently used the HP Pre 3 and use iOS quite often due to another family member owning an iphone 4. Here are my thoughts: The budget for his replacement phone was $100 and I told him to review ATT's website for an appropriate smartphone. I'd already researched this and found the Lumia 920 to be the best value for money. His investigation landed him between the 920 and the iphone 4s which would be decided by a visit to an ATT store. Our initial impression was that it was rather heavy and large but he was able to fit it into his jeans pocket without much difficulty. Other than siri he found the 4s to be underwhelming and was quite impressed with his initial experience with windows phone 8 and ordered a black one. My impressions are the 920 is an impressive piece of hardware, yes it's heavy but it's also rock solid and doesn't need a case. I personally hate cases and have carried all my phones naked for the last several years which is nearly impossible with an iphone. If you add an otterbox case to an iphone it'll weigh almost the same as a 920. As another reviewer stated if you've had your present phone for more than a year the 920 won't be much heavier. This is a decent tradeoff for wireless charging and NFC in my opinion. Once you go wireless charging you'll never go back and is one of main the reasons I stuck with webOS phones for this long. The phone personally handles well because all buttons are within easy reach. However if not positioned optimally the edges of the phone may dig into your palms but this is probably dependent on your hand's size. I love the camera button that allows a quick shot without unlocking the phone first. Windows phone 8 is slick and modern compared to iOS's antiquated OS. iOS has slick apps but the OS itself is clunky. You need apps to do everything in iOS while a lot of functionality is already integrated into Win 8. One brilliant feature is family group where members can privately share a to do list, pictures, calendar and more. Skype is also fully integrated and social media profiles are linked similar to webOS's implementation. Kid's Corner is also an excellently thought out idea. Of course if you're an app junky win 8 may not be for you right now but that'll change in the next few months as the OS was only released to developers a few weeks ago. The only other windows phone in this price range presently is the HTC 8x but the $100 version only has 8Gb of ram (vs 32 gb in the 920) and lacks Nokia's killer apps like Nokia Drive, city lens, ESPN etc. There aren't any comparable Android Phones at this price point as I would only consider 4.2 and above as having comparable stability and fluidity. The Nexus 4 is nice but costs $299 plus it's wireless charging pad costs extra while it's presently free with the 920.

I think there are other languages such as Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Korean. Since this is very intuitive phone to use, the additional language is perfect for my parents. * The phone is beautifully designed and grips very well in my hand. The curved gorilla glass is durable and more ergonomic for finger gestures. * The screen resolution is amazing and it's higher than the retina display. The AMOLED screen along with Clear Black technology along with True Black gives you sharp contrast and richer color. This screen definitely works better in bright daylight as it said it would. * The ultra-sensitive screen also works when I wear gloves on a cold day. No need to take the gloves off, which is nice during cold weather. * The camera quality can't be beat on this phone. Night time captures without flash is bright and clear and there's not a phone out there that can do this. The floating lens and image stabilization works wonders when moving. Moving objects are captured without any ghost effect. * There are additional camera features built in for users to easily edit photos and change lens style, etc. * NFC on great for sharing photos, videos or files with friends. In addition, with my Nokia JBL PowerUp speaker, it automatically pairs and charges the phone simply place it on top of the speaker while playing music. * My partner has iTunes, but with the companion software, it imports all of his playlists, music, photos, and other contents effortlessly. * I really like the Nokia Drive+ navigation software. It's free and works perfectly. I like the option where I can download the maps locally so it doesn't have to rely on internet connectivity. The software also comes with downloadable voice guiding options in many languages! In addition, you can select voice of male or female, depending on your preference. * Everything I have is accessible via the SkyDrive, including documents where I can edit directly on my phone using the built in Office apps. I keep my shopping list so it's always updated either from my phone, tablet, or home computer. Photos are automatically uploaded to SkyDrive so there's no need to connect the camera to my PC. * If you get this phone, definitely check out the accessories!!! I got the black Nokia JBL PowerUp speakers. Amazing surround sound and the phone is Dolby certified. The PowerUp actually charges my phone as I use it.",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1594,B00A2V7BA4,Daniel Peterson,3,16-Nov-12,False,"Great hardware, OS has promise but needs work, sync is TERRIBLE","I'm a big Windows Phone fan. I bought a Focus on the day it came out (and was the only non Microsoft employee in the store buying one). I later moved up to a Lumia 900, which was even better. When Windows Phone 8 and the Lumia 920 were announced, I had made up my mind that THIS was the next phone I was getting. When I got my first Windows Phone I liked the hardware but thought the device had a lot of promise, but that there was a lot of stuff that had gotten dropped on the software side because they simply ran out of time. Unfortunately, with the cutover to the new kernel, I find myself feeling the same way again with Windows Phone 8. The Good: On the hardware side, the Lumia 920 is fantastic. Build quality is very good, and the phone feels like a high quality product. It feels very solid, and while it did initially feel a bit heavier than my Lumia 900, it's honestly not an issue. I haven't gotten my wireless charging plate from AT&T yet, it's still on back order, but I'm excited about that as well. The screen looks fantastic, everything looks much sharper than the older screens. I'm not sure what the OS is doing to scale older applications, but it looks great. The camera is also quite good, the image stabilization on videos looks great, and it performs quite well in low light. The changes to the live tile setup are actually more useful than I had thought they would be. For the most part, the smaller sized live tiles work exactly like the larger versions, get updated properly with status information (number of new emails, etc) and really do give you a lot more flexibility in terms of arranging the home screen. I was a little worried that the change from Bing to Nokia maps would be a bit awkward, as I particularly enjoyed the Bing Maps routing based on the traffic. Overall I've been impressed by the new maps apps, and drive has worked great for turn by turn navigation. There's a lot of other little tweaks here in there in the OS that fix some of the silly little annoyances I noticed about Windows Phone 7 (text selection is much easier now, you can multi-delete text message threads, etc). The Meh: Honestly, other than the start screen changes, most of the major OS changes on the phone seem to be behind the scenes. Other than the hardware differences and the start screen, my day to day Windows Phone experience really hasn't changed substantially with the upgrade. The new features that do exist seem like they really weren't usability/focus tested with real world use cases. Kids corner is a great idea, that I haven't seen elsewhere. Unfortunately, if you put a password on your phone to unlock it, it also password locks kids corner as well, with no way to disable that behavior. Maybe that made sense to someone, but it's left a lot of the rest of us scratching our heads. It's still early, but there's not really much in the way of apps taking advantage of the new features that did make it into this release. THere's also a number of Windows Phone 7 apps that simply don't appear in the store if you're running Windows Phone 8 because they aren't compatible (including ones I've purchased). Presumably both of these will go away over time, but for people buying now, it's an issue. The ""app gap"" between Windows Phone and other platforms is starting to close, but there's still some high profile apps that don't exist here. I can do most of what I'm interested in, but this is going to be especially noticeable for smaller services/companies. Your local minor league baseball team may have iOS & Android apps, but they probably are not working on a Windows Phone version for example. Microsoft has recognized this and seems to be working hard to stir up interest (and also throwing money at developers to port), but still an issue, especially for people jumping platforms. The Bad: With Windows Phone 8, Microsoft got rid of the Zune software to sync with your PC in favor of exposing the folders to your PC via drag and drop. When you connect the phone to your PC, there's folders for Music, Documents, Videos, Ringtones, etc than you can drop files into to transfer them to your phone. This is actually a good thing if you're a person who wants to drag and drop files to/from your phone, but that is not in any way how I want to interact with a device. They released a Windows 8 app and a desktop app for Windows 7/8 to ""sync"" content to your phone from your Windows libraries or in the case of the desktop software, from iTunes. Unfortunately, these apps are very bare bones, and the desktop app crashes for me almost every time I try and sync music from iTunes. Microsoft provided no migration path for existing users using the Zune software to start syncing with Windows Phone 8, and strangely, for the ""best"" experience in terms of syncing your phone, it appears you should be using iTunes. And when the desktop app does actually work, it's not an actual ""sync"" at all, in terms of syncing up things like podcast positions, etc. between the phone and the PC, it's just a straight copy. In a lot of cases, album art isn't being copied down to the phone either. The entire Windows Phone 8 sync process has been a huge source of pain for people on various forums, with people ending up finding terrible workarounds to this setup. There's currently just no way to fill the gap left behind by moving away from the Zune software. I've got a fancy new phone with tons of space, and no easy way to fill it up with my content, drag and drop just really is not how I want to manage music in 2012. Getting rid of the Zune software also means no more sync over wifi, which was really one of the better Zune features. The Xbox Music Pass, and in particular the ""cloud"" features seem somewhat buggy as well, with things randomly working/not working. Same goes for purchases in the video store, although I'm not sure if those are supposed to work on Windows Phone 8 or not. Overall: Hardware wise, the 920 is fantastic, I have zero complaints, it's a huge step up from the last generation of Windows Phones. Unfortunately, software wise it really seems like we're in a similar situation to the 7.0 release, where things look promising, but most of the really interesting stuff isn't there. For Windows Phone 7, it was because they started from scratch. In Windows Phone 8, it seems to be due to the time required to get everything up and running on the new kernel. I'm hoping the new kernel and technology stack allow for more frequent OS updates, and there's a ""Mango"" style update in the hopper already. Hopefully the sync software gets better, and Microsoft can fill in the gaps to match an experience similar to the one the Zune software provided, because this really isn't enjoyable at all, and the features aimed at having everything content wise in the cloud are buggy at best, and broken at worst. UPDATE 3/6/2013: I've had the phone for about 4 months now, and honestly, not much has changed. Sync apps have gotten more stable, but none of the feature gaps between WP7/Zune and WP8 have been addressed at all. People I've talked to privately at Microsoft have expressed unhappiness with the current music/video/podcast experience on WP8, but so far we really haven't seen any major effort to fix it. Xbox video is STILL incompatible with WP8. Xbox Music is still a mess. WP8 is getting more apps, although honestly I attribute that more to Nokia than anything that Microsoft has done. We still are missing a number of high profile apps from other platforms, and many others lag behind other platforms in terms of features, etc. I also haven't seen much in the way of apps utilizing any features specific to WP8, such as the wallet, etc. The speed of updates for WP8 hasn't really changed much from WP7. We got Portico, which fixed some bugs and added a few features, but Microsoft has been largely silent on any future plans. Hopefully we don't end up waiting until Holiday 2013 for the next big update. To their credit, Nokia has been responsive, and been fixing/updating their apps frequently. It seems like in general, they're a lot more excited about the platform than Microsoft is.",44.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1723,B00A2V7BA4,Duliee,5,16-Nov-12,False,Outstanidng Phone.,"Nokia proved me right. I was a customer with Apple for three years up until last week when I switched to Nokia. I was using my iPhone intensively with a lot of apps and important notes and I was worried that I'm going to miss all of that. However, I was frustrated by I phone 4s and 5 since they didn't meet higher standards that I was expecting. So I moved and I bought a black Lumia 920 .online The Lumia 920 is outstanding. very stylish, very fast, very strong camera, has a good feeling to it when you hold it as well as being so flexible and easy to use. Although it is a bit heavy, I believe that is a good thing since more attention will be paid to the phone so it will not fall off easily. I was able to find almost all of the apps that I was using in the Apple app store. You can easily play with the setting and change the whole design of the phone in a second. its so playful that you feel there are colors and pictures everywhere. Also, by choosing the black one , my move was classic and I like that. One of the best thing about this phone is the Microsoft Office package. This was an essential step why I bought this phone. You can use a version of Microsoft word, PowerPoint, excel to do work anywhere you are which is really important for my work and my college as well. Also, It took me a couple of days to get used to its feeling since I was used to apple so much. To summarize, this Nokia phone is an outstanding one. It exceeded my expectations and I believe that it is a matter of weeks for them to upload many new apps as promised by Microsoft. go to a Microsoft store, At&t branch and take a look at this phone. I'm sure you would love it.

1547,B00A2V7BA4,Deja Revu,5,16-Nov-12,False,Great All Around Device with Premium Content,"Nokia is betting the farm on the 920 and 820 phones and Windows Phone 8 -- their survival depends on the success of these devices. It should come as no surprise that the content of the 920 is first rate and, even better, all that goodness comes at a low price. Smart people will take advantage of this situation, while it lasts. The specs of the device speak for themselves. It is bigger and somewhat heavier than some competing devices, but seriously, anyone who has issues with the weight of this device needs to get to the gym immediately. The size and quality of the display make for easier reading and typing. My wife asked me to hang on to her phone, when her hands were full. I threw it in my shirt pocket and promptly forgot it was there, until she asked for it back, an hour later. Happy to report that I experienced no lasting effects -- neck strain, that sort of thing. No need to repeat all the good points noted in the 28 (at this point in time) five-star reviews. Make what you want of the single one-star review. The point of that commenter is that the first five reviewers all must have been lying or paid shills, because they expressed their delight in their new phones. The one-star reviewer had nothing to say about the 920 iteself, leading one to conclude that the reviewer had no actual experience with the phone, or unsupervised experience with any cellular device, for that matter. Having helped my wife get her new 920 up and running, I must say -- the hardware is beautiful and WP8 a nice evolution of an already fine operating system. The OS is intuitive and simple to learn. I want to own a phone, but I don't want my phone to own me. WP8 works well for me (a WP7.5 user) and my wife (a former Android user).

3661,B00HWEMZ1E,Morgen,5,16-Jun-14,False,A game changer (especially after the 8.1 update),"Windows Phones have been seen in a negative light by most with the rise of Android and the iPhone's consistent performance in the markets. Many review sites always harp on the lack of apps and how the OS isn't as fully functional as the above mentioned two. Fun Fact: I don't need a million apps and neither do you. Take out your phone right now and count how many you actually use on a daily basis, for me the number is 12. All 12 are available on the Windows app store. The only real thing lacking is games, there is no Clash of Clans or Candy Crush to be found here (Thankfully in my opinion) For the most part your major apps are all there (Netflix, Kindle, IMDb, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, Spotify, OneNote, Messenger, etc.) Fitbit is currently missing but is working on an app that should release in the coming months so that is a pitfall for some. Now lets talk integration: Windows Phones come with Microsoft Office! Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all make an appearance. No, they aren't the full feature rich versions you can use on a PC. Yes, you can do plenty of basic editing and creating and so forth. OneNote also makes an appearance that lets you sync all your notes easily across devices with a Microsoft account. You can sync all those important accounts onto your Windows Phone, iCloud, gmail, Outlook, Exchange servers, whatever quickly and easily. Live tiles are the customization option of choice with Windows Phone, you can see information at a glance with constantly updating tiles on the screen that are both beautiful and functional. You can unpin and resize them as you see fit (this makes it a great time for a first time smartphone user, you can literally have just a call tile, text tile, internet tile, and email tile if that's all you want. Great for kids are uncertain older folks, but customizable enough that you can make your home screen a work of art with minimal effort at all. Cortana is a voice assistant that comes with Windows Phone 8.1, way more personal than Google Now and with more features than Siri she is a great addition that you will quickly find many use for. There is the common across all platforms feature of setting reminders and alarms, but Cortana can actually set specific reminders so when people call you individual notifications pop up reminding you to tell them things. Also her banter is pretty great, for example if you tell her that you love her she will say something along the lines of ""I love you"" you will get ""I bet you tell that to all the phones"" but she has multiple responses for the same type of questions which is nice. Now as for this phone itself Nokia has always made good phones and this is no exception. 1080p screen, super fast processor, amazing 20MP Pureview camera, great battery life, and solid build quality make this one of the best ways to get into Windows Phones and with support growing by the day for the platform the Icon is a great choice to jump in with.",12.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Icon-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00HWEMZ1E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51W3p2zTv9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HWEMZ1E,159,233.71,0.0

2208,B00CQAODG4,paul riggs,5,16-Jun-13,True,Awesome! From an android user,"Background: I owned the Iphone 2g, which was a spectacular phone for its time. I stuck with iphone until around 2011 when I started to think it was boring and I bought a Droid razr, which was also a good phone but not spectacular, I eventually broke it and upgraded to a galaxy nexus. I became very accustomed to android and its ecosystem. I used TONS of different apps, launchers and eventually ROMS for my Gnex. I loved the phone and I loved androids customization. However by 2013 the phone had lost its luster, I was sick of the poor battery life, instability and LAG. So I thought about getting the Galaxy S4 or Note2 or even waiting (I'm on Verizon) for the HTC one. The problem was I was worried about the battery life of all of those except the note 2. I knew I didn't want to go back to Iphone because even though it is super stable, with tons of apps, its just so boring to me. So I thought I might try the lumina 928, that was a week ago. Lumia Review: -Build quality- The phone is really extremely well built. Especially coming from a samsung phone it seems very durable and study. -Setup-- No Sweat. The phone added all my verizon backup agent info and then nearly seemlessly merged it with my contacts from my google account. -Call Quality-- wow, no really wow. Loud and clear. You can tell the phone has 3 mic's and advanced background noise cancellation. -Keyboard-- Since this isn't android the keyboard better be good and luckily it is very good, and very accurate. I was worried coming from swipe that this might be a deal breaker but it's so smooth and it autocorrects very well. -Screen-- The screen is beautiful, Just go look at one at the store, its great. I read before I bought it that the white has a greenish tint if you look at it at a sharp angle and that is true. However since I am the one using the phone I don't really have to worry about that. -Windows 8-- I am actually really impressed with the OS. I always think of microsoft as old-school but the interface is very clean and minimalist. The apps are lacking like you read in every other review but I don't have anything that I miss that much other than my bank app (USAA) I can use pageonce instead or just go to the mobile site but I really do miss that app. Otherwise all the apps I really use are there and more are coming all the time. While windows 8 is not in the same realm of customization as android it is much more fun and customizable than IOS, while maintaining the same stability as IOS. I like that live tiles of different sizes, they don't replace widgets from android but they do hold some information and flip from front to back or scroll through photos...etc. I also really like the Theme aspect of WP8. I used to customize my nexus from top to bottom and make it a black and white theme or a super-hero theme or a family theme....etc. WP8 can't do everything that android can but you can quickly change tile colors or from a black or white background. This may not seem like much but its cool and it takes only seconds and everything remains stable, smooth and fast. -Camera-- The camera is very good, I am not a huge camera buff. I use it to take pictures of vacations or kids or events and so on. I have used it quite a bit and the Nokia photo suite is really useful and intuitive. The Xenon flash works like a charm and works for flashlight apps too. The talk about it being a great camera is true, however it does sometimes seem to change its white balance very quickly. Like I said I am not a camera buff and that might be fixed in the settings but out of the box, its one of the things I noticed. -Battery-- This was and is one of the deciding factors for this phone, I hated charging my nexus all the time. So far for me the battery life has been great. I did get it down into the 30% range in like 6 hours on the first day but that was with near constant use. With normal use it makes it though the day no problem. That being said I was trying to get all the info I could on the battery before I made this purchase so I will tell you all I know. With the GPS on (Nokia Drive+ is great BTW) I think the phone will last a little over 3 hours with no charging. That is much longer than my android phone but still a huge battery drain as most GPS's are. The phone is SUPER efficient in standby, I mean I think it uses .5-2% per hour if you just leave it. My nexus would easily go down 7-10% per hour and this is much better than that. The lumia 928 comes with a ""battery saver"" in the settings. You can set it to turn on manually, when low, or always (not recommended). I am not sure why always is not recommended but I have it activating when the phone is ""low"" which I think is at < 40% (when the battery turns yellow). The phone gets more efficient below 40% and seems to last as long if not longer than the last 60%. The battery has done really well so far and I liken it to an Iphone battery, doing more with less. If you are coming from a razr maxx or Note2 you may be disappointed otherwise I think this will do surprisingly well for you. -Recommended apps-- If like me you are coming from one of the other platforms with 6X as many apps you may want to know which apps you should pick up. -The new Facebook and Twitter work well I think they have been updated since most of the reviews. -I like USAToday and WSJ news apps, I missed apps like stubleupon, pulse and flipboard so I started to use weave but I didn't really like it. -UC browser is better than IE. IE is ok, it will work but you should try UC browser. -Customizable tiles(wifi, bluetooth, location) getting one of those apps is handy -Netflix works well -Audible is an app I use daily and It works well -ebay and amazon are good -Pageonce is a good app if your bank isn't in the windows store like me -I love the roku remote app (if you have a roku), I really like not losing that little remote Overall I really recommend the phone. I think its stability is great and its not boring at all, the camera is a standout and the usability of the phone is through the roof!",19.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

However I know that the processor is pretty slow, so I wouldn't recommend for any gamers.

14228,B071ZDQ6MV,H. Rosen,2,16-Jul-17,True,Feels like an knockoff brand phone.,"Overall, this is a phone which does everything I need it to. However, there are a few glitches and features that are missing that make it feel more like I bought some off-brand phone instead of what I was expecting (and hoping) from Nokia. For instance, several times a day it asks me to select which SIM I'm using (even though I only have one in there), and the google app screen randomly disappeared until I restarted the phone, and then the widgets I had disappeared from the main screen. The intentional lack of LED notification light in the US version is really unfortunate. Although there are third-party apps to install that can simulate it, I'd much rather have the notification light integrated into the phone itself which is what I expect from and want in a modern smart phone. I've also noticed a lot more pop-up ads and such when I'm browsing articles online which take you away from the page you were viewing, but I'm not sure if that's due to the phone or not. If this is a sign of what Nokias are going to be like, I don't think I'll be buying them in the future. I feel like I could have gotten something with similar functionality (albeit maybe with less storage and a worse camera) for half the price.",1.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

This is a very basic feature I have had on every cell phone since the dawn of the cell phone era! I think Microsoft get's unfairly picked on quite a bit, but this is a blunder that is inexcusable. Even worse, the Windows Phone user forums have been BEGGING for this feature for YEARS!!! My business relies heavily on the call time and duration from the call history because that's how I get paid.

A Well trusted company from mobile ages, classy, elegent design, great build quality, awesome battery life, Smooth Os, Tons of NECESSARY Apps. I was up for an upgrade and was deciding in Lumia 920 or Galaxy SIII. Since i am android fan i was up for Galaxy sIII until i looked at this phone in the stores and the hype it carried before prerelease on youtube. After watching review videos on youtube where in every video lumia 920 outsmarted galaxy SIII ( this is also a great phone :) ) i thought to give it a try. ( Also i was getting bored of Android and wanted a change .. No Not iphone for me ... thats the most dumbest phone i belive) Reasons : WP8 : Stable OS. Can't be compared with Android (Android is in the skies right now ... and W98 is climbing up) yes but the features it carries are awesome and well worth. WP8 is a win..!! Buttery Smooth OS No lag whatsoever unlike Android who made it now when they reached JB. The Ease of the OS is awesome anything you want just pin it and done. One of the best OS out there simply better in this segment than Android and IOS. Microsoft really wants to play it hard to compete GOOGLE and APPLE. Updates are preidic. App Store is less comptetive as compared to Google & Apple Apps Store but all the necessary apps are there. Its increasing dialy .. lot of apps are counted in as such. If you are nto App Frenzy and all the required apps you need, you can get it on Windows App Mkt. BATTERY LIFE: Android phones are awesome however the battery life sucks on those. I had 2 Android Phones i am well aware of it. But there are also reasons for that .. OS is much powerful and thus requires a lot of battery. NOKIA has always been a king in Battery Life. This is my 4th NOKIA phone. ( 3310, N72, N73 and now LUMIA 920 ) I am getting 27hrs of battery life. ( Not Kidding ... M serious) with full use (4g lte, listening music while commuting, facebooking, transit maps and all) I just charge this phone during nights while sleeping thats it. I know few people are suffering from Battery Problem but dont blam the company the phones you may have got are unfortunately are defective. I think 17hrs+ battery life you can easily get on the lumia 920. Just let your phone drain 2-3 times intially and then go to go. NOKIA APPS : The best bundle one can get with WP8 Apps. This is a win. Lots of well trusted, awesome Nokia Apps which are your daily needs is a complete win. MUSIC : This Phones puts other music players and phones to shame. Insanely Awesome. MAPS : Offline navigation Oh boy... What else one needs. Touch Sensitivity is great so is the UI. Also if you are the fan of GOOGLE MAPS .. dont worry You have app Named GMaps which solves your purpose. Please APPLE MAPS cant be compared with these. They Suck. CITY LENS: This is a most innovative app in the mobile industry and is the best. Accurate Judgment. By far the best. CAMERA : Best Camera No Words... Watch Youtube for detailed reviews on this. Low Light Pics.. Now thats a innovation. 1080P Video is just awesome. Nokia has always won in the Camera Segment i had a Nokia N73 with 3.2 mp carl zeis optics. That phone was the king... and had the best camera those days. Apps in Camera : All are good and awesome. If need all the advance settings go with Proshot App its a great App. MEMORY : 32 Gb Internal. Well that was never a concern for me. I personally feel 32gb is more than sufficient for us in our smartphones... unless people really want to put blu ray movies in their phones. I had Samsung Galaxy SII 16gb internal + 16gb External and i never crossed 25gb. So i am okay with it. DISPLAY : The display is gorgeous and PureMotion HD+ display (WXGA (1280 × 768) is just great. I know as per the CES 2013 all cell phones are coming with 1080p HD Display but still this Display is insanely awesome and does the work it needs to. Galaxy SIII's Display is not as good as Lumia 920s ... Agh.. Iphone .. damn i hardly care about it. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants to try to go with new OS and a Awesome Trusted Smartphone.",8.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

15323,B075FL4H89,T. Azores,4,16-Dec-17,True,A decent phone,"This is fine as a phone--and in an age of smartphones, I think that a dumbphone like this still does have its place. Mostly, this phone will come in handy as an emergency phone. I tend to bring this phone with me if I'm going out for a few minutes to run errands. Or if I'm going to be going somewhere with a ton of people (ie the Christkindlmarket), I'd prefer to take this phone with me, not my actual phone. Between my Apple Watch and this phone, I'm all set. A couple of things, though.... The arrow buttons surrounding that home button are hard to press because that ring/button around the home button is so narrow. This could've used some of the old Nokia dumbphone shortcuts, like the other reviews and comments have said, or the option to set up shortcuts. And as long as you want to reboot this phone, well...why not add the ability to use wifi? Also: Your best bet is to pair this phone with a cell phone plan that gives you talk and text. The browser is exactly as bad as you think it is for a dumbphone. When I set up my prepaid plan with T-Mo, I originally got a plan that included data...way too much data for a phone like this...only because I wanted to see what Twitter and Facebook look like on this phone. (Spoilers: Nokia didn't give us special apps for Twitter or Facebook. They're just bookmarks to Twitter or Facebook with the Opera browser. It was nice to see this for a few seconds for the nostalgia, I guess, but a data plan is a waste on this phone.) If you intend to use this phone for the long haul, then just stick with a talk+text plan. Or if you can find a plan that gives you, oh...maybe 1 gig of data a month?...that should be plenty for a phone like this.

At this point I'm not sure why anyone would bother spending the outrageous amount of money that Ipods cost. You can get this phone and a Micro SD card for under $100 almost year-round. If you buy it on sale you can get a 64GB Micro SD with this phone for around $50. That is around $200 less than an Ipod Touch, it also allows you to use Cortana, a new search function/Program for the windows phone. If you want to use it as an MP3 player or a phone I would recommend it. In fact if you want to use this thing as a decoration, I'd still recommend it. For the price I can't see a single reason anyone wouldn't buy this phone.

You will also have to do this in order to use certain functions on the phone, you do NOT however need to purchase a phone package. This phone also uses AT&T which I'd rate 6/10, I find most phone companies to be lacking in general. However, for what it is, the service is not bad and the plans are fairly decent as well.

1088,B00836Y6B2,Dr. Jefe,1,16-Dec-12,False,The Lumia 920 Failure,"I wanted to like it, I really did. I just purchased a new Win8 computer and figured I would upgrade my phone to the Lumia 920 in the spirit of homogeneity. Let me tell you that doing so was a HORRIBLE idea - where to start. Weight - this brick, I mean phone, tips the scales at a cool 185 grams, compared to the 133 gram Galaxy S3 or 140 gram iPhone 4S. When asked why it weighed so much, the salesman told me it was because the phone is made from the same composite as is astronaut helmets. Nice - I can now sleep better knowing that if the Mayans are right, at least my Lumia 920 is prepared for its journey through the cosmos. To all my skinny jean wearing hipsters, you and this phone simply cannot be - the sheer size and mass of it make it a nightmare to carry in regular sized pants, I can't even imagine the kind of dances you'll do to get the Lumia in and out of your jeggings pockets. This brick could be a safety hazard if one of these crazy youths tries to rob me on his way to Hot Topic, though my Lumia could possibly double as a shield, or even a weapon if I decided to shotput at my assailant. Onto the UI - wow, anyone who says the apps are incredible must be kidding. Moving past the fact that google refuses to create apps for the Win8 OS, none of the apps that are built for this phone are designed by their actual developers. Facebook is a Microsoft app, Whatsapp doesn't even exist, the Pandora app is a blog about the music on Pandora - sweet, nothing satiates my hunger for The Jonas Brothers or Biggie Smalls like the words of Joe and Jane Smith as they opine on hottest 1950's Christmas album. What few games they do have, i.e. angry birds, looks like they have been shrunk down from a tv screen onto my phone. The aspect ratio is atrocious, not to mention that for me to download anything, I have to use my Hotmail account that I opened and retired when I was in fifth grade - which may be a real selling point for the hipsters as eclectic/old school schwag is all the rage these days. As per the screen size ... the phone may be huge but a good portion of it is cannibalized by the bezel , again probably some brilliant innovation necessary to make the phone more functional as I use it to fend off attacks but not when I want to compose documents in MS office, which is a function I will NEVER use on my phone. But our friends at Nokia were smart enough to include a wireless charger, this was a HUGE plus, I find that plugging my phone into the wall while I sleep at night is cumbersome AND tedious. Corded phones chargers are so 2010 - what are we still using the rotary phones here? Think of all the extra things I can do now that I don't have to plug my brick into the wall! At about 6 hours of battery life, I know that whatever charging device I get is going to get plenty of love. So that's it, this phone is horrible. Anyone who says otherwise is either crazy, or is finally making the upgrade from their Razor flip phone. Keep up the good work Nokia, you've successfully kept old school by giving us those old school features we expected in 2005.",4.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 900 Black Factory Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-900-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00836Y6B2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZlbLtZ3PL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00836Y6B2,929,109.98,0.0
1616,B00A2V7BA4,Matt,1,16-Dec-12,False,Big disappointment,"After looking online at a number of different smartphones i decided to give the new lumia 920 a try. phone had a lot of positive reviews and was at a pretty cheap price point. After having the phone for a few weeks now i am shocked that people are talking positively about the phone. These are either reviews written by microsoft or nokia or no one on here has ever had a smartphone before. I would return it if i could but will certainly be looking to upgrade as soon as possible. I read about how great the screen was, its not. When compared side by side with almost every other high-end smartphone its noticeably poorer quality. Simply pull up an app, a website, anything and just hold it next to another phone and its noticeable. i dont know maybe people think the quality is good cause they do a good job with screen color contrasting with black and the colors. App store - there is nothing in here. All of the apps that are in the app store are apps that microsoft and nokia actually built. none of them are native and wont see the same features and functionality from facebook, youtube, etc. games are a joke, there really is nothing here. it reminds me of blackberry. if you dont have access to apps i am not sure what you really do with the phone. there is no whatsapp. only real app i could find was skype which makes sense since microsoft owns skype. unless you are happy just using your phone to check email and surf the web (circa blackberry in early 2000s), this is not a modern smartphone. camera - again i read all about how great the low light camera is. nothing impressive here, pretty similar to other pics i was getting with my s2 or old iphone4. side by side you cant tell the difference and neither of those phones are even new. I think what i am most frustrated about is the form factor. this phone is a brick and thats putting it nicely. thing is really really thick and weighs a ton. this is more upsetting to me since i actually had a chance to recognize this as a problem and i ignored it.

22336,B07N11SM58,Macros_1,5,15-Oct-19,True,"Not exactly perfect, but consistently delighted every time I use it!","I went into my purchase of the Nokia 9 with tempered expectations. I read the ""professional"" reviews that harped on the camera and fingerprint sensor. But I really needed something to replace my Galaxy S8 and my previous month experience with the Galaxy S10+ was underwhelming and frustrating. So I ignored the reviews and gave the Nokia 9 a shot....and I am extremely glad I did! First off, if you're into blue (I am), the phone is beautiful. It has a classic design with bezels on the top and bottom. In the age of notches and full face displays with camera holes, it may seem passé...but it doesn't bother me and I think I like it more than the S10+ look. The phone is heavier than most of the recent ones I've used, but not bigger. It's just more dense and reminds me of older Nokia phones that were built like tanks. My initial two days of use with the phone were in stark opposition of my first two days with the Galaxy S10+. Rather than disappointment, I was constantly surprised at how good the Nokia 9 was for my use case and at less than half the price! Rather than wax philosophically about the past two weeks, here are some of the things that stood out to me: 1. Best outdoor display I've used since Nokia's old Windows Phones. I could easily see the phone in direct sunlight. 2. Clean build of Android with only one extra app provided by HMD/Nokia. I was able to personalize the phone the way I wanted it and use whatever app I cared to use. No artificial limitations like some other manufacturers. 3. I've not seen anyone else mention this but I had significantly better reception with the Nokia 9 compared to the Galaxy S10+. Places where I had little to no signal with the Galaxy were no problem for the Nokia. 4. Battery is MUCH better than I was expecting. I can easily go all day with 50% remaining. The Galaxy was better in this respect, but all the reviews I read complained about the size of the battery...but I'm not sure if they actually used it to see how long it lasts. 5. I'm not a pro photographer, but the camera has been great to me so far. Quick and easy to use. The dreaded ""processing"" message doesn't really impact me (likely because I don't take pictures and instantly try to edit them). I do wish there was a two stage camera button like the old Lumia's...but can't have everything we want. It can't be all puppies and unicorns, there are a few things that aren't quite great about the 9: 1. No SD Card support. The 128GB storage capacity is probably all I'll ever need...but it would be nice to have a safety blanket. 2. Why couldn't they put in dual front facing speakers? There's bezel...use it! The single speaker is good, but could have been much better. 3. No headphone jack. Enough has been said about this. All in all I've been delighted since moving from the Galaxy S10+ to the Nokia 9 (and my wallet has been as well)! Its capabilities far exceed its shortcomings. Time will tell how well it holds up but for now, I'll just keep smiling every time I look at it. I just hope there are others like me who ignore the professional reviews and give this phone the chance is deserves.

20639,B07HD3QC65,Ricochet,4,15-Nov-18,False,Nokia 7.1 - Another Great Nokia Phone - Pie Update Released 11/28/2018!,"**Update - Phone now runs Android Pie 9.0 Trail to the 7.1.. purchased a Nokia 6.1 2 months ago to replace a failing Nexus 6P. Phone is great. It recently received Android Pie and it's transformed the phone. Wow. The taller, thinner design of the 7.1 with it's 18:9 aspect was very appealing. Primarily because it put the fingerprint sensor in better proximity for my finger. My finger falls on the sensor in a much more natural / relaxed position on the 7.1 over the 6.1. The 7.1 itself is great. Has what the 6.1 is missing. More RAM, more onboard storage, faster CPU and improved camera. Like the 6.1 I am pleased with the build quality and construction. It's exactly what I expected. What's not good. It's still running Oreo 8.1 (for now), so I cannot restore the back up of my 6.1 to my new 7.1. Very disappointing. **Edit - Pie update released 11/28/2018 I've had to forego starting to use and carry the 7.1 because of this. My old device is set up on Pie and working very well. I don't want to set the 7.1 up as a new device and go through all of the settings, downloading apps, creating folders, entering wi-fi passwords, and not keep text history or my app data, etc. Come on Nokia, great device... Now give it Pie so we can move on. It should have come by now. Its the only thing keeping me from using the phone. While none of Nokia's offerings are rated higher than IP52, they are some of the most durable devices available. Scratch resistance level is above average. These devices also do not bend or crack under stress. Safe for a back pocket. YouTube durability tests speak for themselves. Good work Nokia!

1509,B00A2V7BA4,Throw your mouse away,5,15-Nov-12,False,Finally Nokia in the game! Again,"I dont own the phone, but will try to buy unlocked to use with another company. I went to Att store and had a chance to play with it. In one word it rocks! It has a classy expensive feel to it like a polished ceramic feel to the body of the phone. Very nice to hold you dont notice the wieght at all unless you grab the HTC WP8 that was next to it. But the HTC is also smaller of course. The Nokia screen very bright, clear and crisp and also very very fluid and super smooth when scrolling sideways or up and down. In all fairness HTC WP8 also very smooth on screen scrolling etc, the processors on both phones are top notch. Took some pictures inside the Att store of a friend of mine, colors very true with or without flash could not try low light because store was fully lighted. I did also take pictures with the HTC WP8 very nice too i would say, but when compared with the lumia 920 both me and my friend noticed lumia much better pictures. The Video recording also outstanding the image stabalizer very nice but if you shake your hand alot of course video will be jumpy. One thing i noticed i played back some music and it was very loud and clear even inside the Att store that was busy and noisy! City lens worked just as they advertise. Everything flows right with the phone go to store and play with it. Sure its WP8 interface from Microsoft. But the live tiles and ability to move and resize, and personalize them seemed much easier to me than the Apps that you move around in an Android phone. Also Most people in this day and age because of age, straining our eyes on computers etc, our eyes are not the same anymore! The abilty to and resize your tiles will makes a world of difference on the eyes! Go to store and try one out you will see for yourself :) Also dont think because because they lowered the price to $99.00 dollars the phone is of inferior quality!

1558,B00A2V7BA4,DKnightRiding,5,15-Nov-12,False,Portable hard drive? Seriously?,"My last review was in 2004 and I even lost that id. I wanted to write this review after seeing all the biased reviews on smartphones. Especially there are mixed reviews for Lumia 920. So, ended up writing a short story covering incidents in the past 4 days. These should definitely help you I believe. Warning: estimated read time - 5-15 minutes. I have been researching to buy a phone for almost 6 months. Why I made the call to try this phone - purely a spec sheet. I have used Samsung droid LTE phone all these days. Have used various iPhones,.. a *lot* without owning one. It is easy nowadays to do that especially after America became fit waiting for it in line for days. Michelle should promote iPhone for kids. Money doesn't matter here as most will agree when it comes to the best smart phone. Any savings from $200 budget is anyway gonna go to accessories for L920, well I am a guy who buys charge-docks for office blackberry out of my own pocket. Accessories complete your experience with any gadget. Lets go for a detailed rundown of all the things that I experienced the past 4 days with this phone: 1. My very first impression: I read many reviews... well, too many. Awfully a lot to be precise - Googled with past-24-hours filter everyday since the announcement of L920. And almost *every* review mentioned it is a 'Hulk' of a phone. My excitement was trembling when I went to the store to check out the phone - my deeper thoughts quivering for a sleekly solid phone instead of a Hulk. Well, was definitely let down there when I picked it up. Damn it was heavy. I literally walk around with a Envy 15 laptop at home for my computing needs not a tablet. Well, it is *not* a matter of GYM, like many Finnish-Fanboys/employees counter. Nokia employees - you guys have to work on your names - you are giving it away too easily. I first picked it up and almost dropped it - matte black, but doesn't have a grip for first time users. So, don't lend your phone to anyone for a call in airport - they will *definitely* drop it. Well, so did I within the first 5 minutes from *atleast* 5 feet (NO grain of salt here) on a hard wood . I scrambled to gather it from floor and checked its health, took some snaps on camera et al. It was SOLID - literally SOLID. My blackberry gets a battery surgery, Samsung LTE gets many corner nicks - many literally - but L920 was totally SOLID! Thats when I decided to give it a full 14 day try. Well, howdy L920? Lets check it out. 2. My friends/colleagues first impressions... Yours' too: I pulled it out of my pocket at work. First comment - portable 'hard drive'! Well, I know! It is brawny and flaunts it too! Like a Lamborghini SUV - Hey! Lamborghini is supposed to be sleek. Well, Nokia really was a luxury class - Saudi Sheikhs used to buy diamond studded and gold plated Nokia long long ago - when Apple released its first ipOd - really! My first phone was 6610 - was in-service for TEN years (i gave it to my dad after 2 years) - changed battery twice, then I forced my dad to go for Sony Ericsson - I was impressed by their worlds first touch phone which I used for just an year. My old 6610 still turns on and I could make a phone call using it - awesome speaker phone, NONE of the phones today would pick up the signal as it does - hmm... probably with a grain of salt. Now you could understand why I would want to try a Nokia still. I soldered my broken power button leads in my Nokia N series to keep it going for 3 more months. I never give up in a gadget unless I know for sure it can never wake up. Ironically like one of those paranoid Hollywood assassins who put bullets in head of a dead target. Without deviation - I didn't really expect such a comment for a beautiful master(literally)! So, I checked the weight of WD essentials - 200g! That was a very good judgement I thought. I then demoed tiles, augmented reality, etc etc. Everyone were impressed! But someone said GS3 is available for $49 on thanksgiving! Really! Even the technically savvy get biased towards unsuited decisions on smartphone because of the reviews. Reviews ARE biased... Every one of them. CNET is the worst of all! Will tell you why later. 3. Lets really talk about *my* judgement on the weight now. It is definitely heavy so, it needs a good grip which it lacks because of its curved slippery edges. In such scenario you would want to hold it tight to counter the gravity on your fingers. That needs the edges to be button-free! What do I do! Let me hold it tight over those buttons and see. Well, it works! Finally I was able to hold the phone with surety. The buttons *will not* be fired unless you intend it to. Holding on them does nothing! Let me be clear, buttons are *not* hard... what am I trying to say?!? Never before experienced buttons in my life! I am talking after an extensive experience of 9 phones two of them too smart! I am discounting 6 phones here even though, they had a full browser and was considered smart in 2004! After two days of use, my brains were *totally* calibrated. They would never ever think of it as a heavy phone anymore. It is a frustration free mobile device that helped me talk for 45 non-stop minutes today, not even once suggesting that earth's gravity is constantly raising (Common! No hands-free you genius!). 4. Usability - What do you want to do now? Windows phone 8 is AWESOME! It would easily beat iOS task by task in accomplish time. Please don't take me wrong here cider drinkers, iOS usability only survives as far as it stands alone. Android Jelly bean shared the stance to some extent now. But Windows Phone 8 knocks down its superiority hands down. Let me be clear, it is *not much* better than iOS, but definitely, trashes its trumpets! When Android is so close, Windows phone 8 blew past it. People who are still biased towards browsing speed, wifi and data speed of Android and iOS should check out windows phone 8's all new IE10 (I love my chrome over IE9). I could run streaming HD videos and download megs of data in a flash. IE10 still has all or none rendering down side, but was really really fast! Entire Hulu.com with a 'worlds-images-data-base' loaded in just 2 seconds (Not cached you genius!). And, UI is buttery smooth to the very meaning of butter - *no* grain of salt here. Settings precise, straight forward and focused. Transition graphics, navigation of controls, application switch, multi-tasking - all blemish less... I would never put myself in a person drinking a Microsoft cool-aid! Eew! That is an oxymoron! Nevertheless I did! Kudos Microsoft for selling a ticket to cool-town! 5. Battery life & heat - one of the most biased opinions on the web? CNET, are you really pissed off because Engadget was given exclusive pre-launch access to L920? Take your narcissistic ideology and shove it! Well... My first focused moment with my device lasted for more than 2 hours! Did everything... downloaded apps like there was no tomorrow. And, configured, sliced and diced tiles, visited even the most boring sites on web, configured all e-mails, played most of the games. Then remembered the dinner. Battery when opened the box was 54%. After the 'brief' moment of 2+ hours 23%! Was shocked to see that. Then another hour with the device and it dropped to teens! Is this one of those deflating moments? Puff! Lets charge it - isn't it natural for a phone to loose power upon usage? Convincing myself, left it for charge the whole night. Next day, played with wireless charger - made my office runway in style with Oohs and Aahs... Well, then opened the web for battery reviews and found all those scary reviews on battery. Freaked me out! Closed the Chrome on my office Windows 7, picked my L920 from charging plate - by this time, I had no issues with either weight or grasp thanks to void-wires and my calibrated brain. Battery life shows 100% and the clock was 1:18 PM. Lets do the drain test... Oh man, couldn't keep my hands off. New York downtown LTE, WiFi, location services, NFC all hunky dory! Installed updates atleast 50MB worth. Browsed some mails - had to search and download some documents from web. Installed few more apps, played some games, used camera, smile shutter etc, Used WiFi and LTE equally. Used Nokia drive through city lens to try - didn't get anywhere but just basked under its awesomeness! Then checked it at 9:00 PM it was around 80ish. Then checked again in the morning, it was 70ish. Then continued my routine again. Had a 45 minute phone call and few more in the evening. After a full day it was 30 ish. Then used for few more - web and occasional petty games mostly that lasted for another 6 hours (mostly idle). Then single digit. I lost patience and blasted into the free gun-bros for half hour... it didn't die down, completed several levels of the flower game on XBOX. Still 3%. Opened youtube and watched HD videos over WiFi for another 20 minutes. Goodbye screen finally! Switched back on, more videos then was dead in minutes - flat! Have left it for charge over USB wall charger. 1 day, 9+ hours with everything ON except bluetooth. This is pretty darn awesome! My Samsung wouldn't last even half a day with these activities! Will check my full drain re-charge again. The phone gets very warm - not hot while browsing web or downloading stuff. My Samsung droid LTE does the same!!! I did find it annoying to the least degree like I have done earlier, but I have used the new iPad and GS3 and they both get the same warmth. It is to do with the dual/quad core processors or GPU I guess. If this gets too annoying it will definitely reflect in my decision in 10 days. 6. Why I didnt buy iPhone? When iPhone first came in everyone thought it was a Porsche that is affordable for a common man! What a blessing! When a bunch of construction workers in New York's freedom towers were using it, I thought, how did Apple do it! It is not features - you need a lot of money to use all the i-'Cloudy' features - for all the rest, droid does! Usability is a myth as I mentioned earlier - it is no one's game now. How did it then? It is the Porsche logo - that sells it... and sells it well. It was always a Camry (Not much of a change in iOS design year over year) with Porsche logo. Reliable with a luxury brand backing - until recently on the news for reliability issues with maps - hopefully it doesn't go for a congressional hearing like Toyota! Well, when many drive Camry and it is the number one selling car, it is not for everyone. I don't want to ride a Camry especially when it costs more than a real BMW! And, I am sure most are in Nokia L920 line today because of that! Atleast all those in GS3's (did I forget the all new Kia? (made of cheap plastic, but great looks and specs)) line are! :-) I would definitely call L920 as BMW quality with poly-carbonate construction with high safety rating and Carl Zeiss lens suspended in springs (rear wheel drive with traction control!), wireless charger and Windows Phone 8 (fly by wire)! I feel L920 so far fits all my needs in specs and pairing with Windows Phone 8 brings a brand new perspective to mobile experience. Hope this Finnish fiddle is heard in the i-'Tuned' world where Gangnam style rocks charts! I called up my in-law in an Indian suburb and mentioned that I bought a Nokia. Response - didn't you get an iPhone 5? Why would you think Nokia will avert a chapter 11? With apple ruling the roost on brand and Samsung the mass, deep in emerging markets! Apple is poised to break records year after year while Samsung will keep increasing its market share steadily with or without apple suits.

You can safely leave your camera at home as the pictures are far superior to any smartphone unless is a Nokia 808 Pureview witch has 41 megapixels and is in another league. The phone does not need a screen cover or protector of any kind (has Corning Gorilla glass) , is built to last like the old Nokia phones, you can see the screen even if the sun is hitting you outdoors, is very fast and to be honest Windows 8 is a notch above Android and even IOS so happy I left behind the boring Iphones already, unless you want to stick with the same phone old people use (Iphones) no excuse not to switch.

1436,B00A2V7BA4,George T,5,15-Nov-12,False,Combined with Akruto Sync this is the Best Phone on the Market,"This is a fantastic phone! It is very capable, easy to use, and stylish. Here's why. Lumia 920's screen with its brilliant colors is simply gorgeous. Clear Black technology uses dual polarizes to reduce reflections and increase contrast. This makes the screen very easy to see outdoors, with no glare. When indoors, it just makes the contrast that much better, resulting in a more vivid picture. Display brightness is adjusted automatically for the bright-light and low-light conditions (but you can change display settings manually, too). In this model, Nokia went with an IPS screen, which has excellent viewing angles. This comes in very handy when you want to show photos on your phone to a group of people, or if you are taking a photo and need to move the phone high above your head or very low. The screen works together with the body to make this a stylish, eye-catching phone. This phone is very well built with its polycarbonate body and scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass screen. Buttons are ceramic, not plastic. The back of the phone is curved, making it nice to hold. The Gorilla Glass screen is also slightly curved, rather than flat. This makes the finger slide more easily on the screen. All in all, Lumia 920 feels very solid and gives off an impression of a high-end device. A unique feature among modern smartphones is the Super Sensitive Touch Display. This technology allows you to use the touchscreen while wearing gloves. No doubt, a great thing not just in Finland, but any place that has winter. The Windows Phone OS is new and refreshing in the sea of Apple and iOS phones. The live tiles bring real-time data right to the main screen without having to start an app. Live tiles are visually very appealing and can be resized and arranged on the screen to your liking. I find this a far better interface than icons on the other OSs. I can access anything I need with one or two taps. I also like how all my data feeds are integrated into the people hub. I can jump from a friend's text message to the emails I exchanged with them, to their recent facebook updates; their phone numbers and address are right there, too, so that I can quickly call them or even get driving directions. Everything is integrated so seamlessly. Compare this to other OSs, in which each of these actions would require you to start a separate app and navigate within the app. The 8.7 MP, PureView camera is made for taking high quality pictures. Lumia 920 uses Carl Zeiss Tessar optics and has real optical picture stabilization (which works better than digital picture stabilization). The low-light performance is phenomenal. There is a dedicated hardware camera button. Pressing the camera button brings you directly to the camera app. Even from the lock screen! You can half-press the button to autofocus, then press it fully to take a shot, just like with a regular digital camera. Or you can tap on the screen, causing the phone to auto-focus on the object you tapped and immediately take the picture. Fully automatic mode works great, but the phone also offers the full complement of manual settings. Expect to charge your battery every night. This is normal for smart phones. You can charge the phone by simply placing it on a charge pad. No need to connect any wires; also the charge pad with no dangling wires looks neater then a regular charger. If you do want to use a cable to charge, the cable is the standard micro-USB. No need to buy proprietary cables and chargers, like you do with certain manufacturer whose names starts with ""a"" and is a fruit. When travelling, I can pack just one charge and use it for my Lumia and for my wife's blackberry. There was one thing lacking in all Windows Phones that almost made me stay away from this great phone, but I found a third party program, called Akruto Sync, which fixes it. Windows Phone does not allow synchronization between Outlook and the phone using a USB cable. This means that if you want to edit your phonebook, calendar, or to-do list on your PC (and you do want that, or you'll have to enter your entire phonebook into your new phone by hand), Microsoft expects you to store them on Microsoft's servers in the cloud. This is meant to be more convenient (no wires), but I have no desire to store my personal information on someone else's servers. After much searching I found Akruto Sync, which offers the best of both worlds. It syncs over Wi-Fi or Internet, but your data is stored on your own PC, not on their server. With Akruto Sync, I can enjoy this outstanding phone. Lumia 920 is a top of the line phone with first-class hardware and software. Well done, Nikia!",237.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1552,B00A2V7BA4,charles_rockefeller,5,15-Nov-12,False,Lumia 920 is the best and most innovative mobile phone in the world now,"Lumia 920 is The best and most innovative moblie phone in the world now and it is Iphone and Samsug Galaxy S III killer I have an Iphone 4 and Samsug Galaxay Note. The problem with these phones have NO personalities.When put your Iphone or Samsug phones together with other people's phones, you can not distinguish which is your phone or others phones. While you are in New York streets, you can see hundreds of other people are holding exact same Iphones as you do and you do not have anything unique for your phone. They all have exact same with UI. Iphone screen is way too small for me to read web sites. Samsug Galaxay Note does have a much bigger screen. But it got hang from time to time and have to restart each time to fix the hang. I can not take any pictures in the low light. It simply give me a black screen in the low light and it does not have any stablizer. I went to California a few month ago, the naviagtion in both phones are not good. If got disconnect from ATT, I got no map. Lumia 920 has a build-in navigation system and have voice directed turn by turn guide offline without any need to connect to ATT network. I should say Iphone and Samsug Galaxy are very good phones. But Nokia Lumia 920 is the best ! Here are Lumia 920 can do while Iphone 5 and Samsug Galaxy can NOT do: 1. The best 8.7 Meg pix camera and HD video recovder with image stablizer while other phones have only 8 Meg pix without stablizer. 2. The best low light camera among all mobile phones. 3. City Lens which can help me to find restaurants, shops, hotels in a strange city. 4. Nokia drive can be used in offline mode without need to connect to ATT. It is an actual GPS device. 5. Free Microsoft Office suite with Outlook, spreadsheet, etc 6. sensitive screen can be used with glove on. especially useful for cold winter. 7. kids corner which allow your kids to play on your phone without remove anythings from your phone. 8. Very beautiful screen with live tiles and I can personalize my screens. 9. Web accesses are compressed up to 45% and can save data plan a big time. 10. Extremely durable and unbreakable. I accidentally dropped my Iphone and its front screen cracked completely. But, I see on a youtube, someone used a big nail and hammer and used the hammer to hit the nail on the Lumia screen and he hit it 10 times and no damage on the Lumia screen. is this amazing ? My Samsug phone has a very thin back cover. I have to buy a protective cover for it as soon as I bought it. Nokia Lumia come with a beautiful cover and it is unbreakable. 11. 32 GB storage without extra charge. 12. Wireless charge. Some reveiwers think Lumia 920 is too heavy. but, it is only 6.5 ounce ! almost same weight as my Galaxy Note with cover. I have to buy a protective cover for my Iphone 4 after I dropped it and cracked the front screen. with the cover, it weight always same as Lumia 920. I do not understand why some people make big fuss about Lumia 920 weight. For Lumia 920, you do not need any cover. it comes with the beautifull and colorful covers. Some reviewers say Iphone and Adroid have 700,000 apps. Up to today, window phone already have 200,000 apps. but, the question is that, do you actually use those 700,000 apps ???!!! I am quite content with all the apps on the window phones and I can not image I can even use these 200,000 apps let alone 700,000. I do NOT need that much apps and I believe 200,000 apps will more than enough for any users ! Anyway, developers all over world are now developing new apps for window phones and bringing out new window phone apps in hundreds daily ! I believe in less than one year, window phone apps can beat Adroid and Iphone apps easily. For window phones, Lumia 920 and 820 are the best among all window phones. HTC window 8X and 8s are nothing as compared with Lumia 920 and 820. HTC used to be a Taiwaness phone assemby factory and got into making mobile phone business because they think this is an industry trend. HTC is a copycat with absolutely no soul for their phones and poor quality also. HTC window 8X has only 16 GB storage and it cast $200 with contract to buy while the best window phone Lumia 920 only need $100 and has 32 GB storage and all above listed features. HTC Window 8X and 8s have NONE of above listed features.

1799,B00A7F57EM,Al M.,5,15-May-13,False,"Great phone, perfect size",I had a windows phone with at&t for about 18 mos. When I moved to Utah the at&t signal was so bad I ended up going to Verizon. When I went to Verizon last summer they had one windows phone which did not seem very good so I bought a Samsung S3. The Samsung is a really solid phone and I like it...However I missed my windows phone so I purchased an 822 on Ebay. I have been using the phone for the past 3 months. I personally like the 822 much better than the S3 because.. The 822 is a bit smaller and it is easier to hold. I get much better battery life Windows phones are infinitely easier to use. I prefer one long page to 5 pages. Fits in my pocket better. I have 4 emails and I can set icons for each on the screen I love the new small/large icon setup. I love the history tab on each contact. I hate having to dig up emails from months ago..flip to the person who sent it and go to history and there it is. You cannot go wrong with either the S3 or the 822. It all comes down to personal preference. One thing I love about Verizon is that you just pop out your sim card and put it in your other phone and your good. You could not do that at at&t when I was with them.

22329,B07N11SM58,E. Arce,3,15-Mar-19,True,For the camera,"September 2019 Update: Well, at least they dropped the price. I don't believe it's worth that much. Finding more issues. Bluetooth is a pain. At first I thought it was my speaker or headphones but turns out it's the phone. Volume adjustment is crazy. There's level 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10. Nothing between 2 and 8. Signal is still spotty. Taking pictures with flash at night is impossible, the timing is way off. I just don't recommend this phone anymore. Original review: Just like me, you are probably looking at this phone for the camera. It is brilliant. Excellent quality. I compare to my note 8, which I still use. The screen quality while taking pictures is perfect. Very detailed. So far, I have only used it for about an hour. I'm still transferring all of my stuff from my note. Also, downloading apps and transferring accounts. The user interface is a bit different. i am going to miss Samsung's interface but I'm sure I will adapt. There's no bloatware except for the google stuff. I still can't figure out how to get rid of the google search bar from the home screen. I am impressed but still figuring things out. I haven't even put my sim card in it. I will update after some more usage. Still playing with the camera features. I want to test blocking certain lenses and see if I still get a picture. Update: one week of usage As expected, battery life is excellent (it's a new phone). I can skip charging one night and still have 50%. I have played with the photo editor and there are some cool 3D and depth features. I took a dark picture last night when I ran into an owl. I was very impressed with the lighting and quality since I was so far away. Signal is better than with my note. It was spotty in my office but with the Nokia, all of my messages are sent and always have 4G now, without having to raise my arm, looking for signal. Again, images are coming out excellent. I have noticed that there is a delay after taking pictures. The phone will tell you images are still processing but you are able to keep taking them. The phone combines 5 pictures captured by the lenses into 1. So far, I am very happy and impressed. Two week update: I went to a concert and got some excellent photos and videos. However, battery drained fast. I was around 40% and was empty at the end of the show. I also witnessed the error other users are reporting. I was taking a lot of pictures and eventually received the ""cannot connect to camera"" error. I can't say if it's a software issue or hardware but it hasn't done it again. It has been 5 days. I've downloaded most of the apps I use frequently. Phone is still running great. Still have a 100 gb left of memory. I have added a few thousand songs but haven't played much with music. Also, haven't played any heavy games yet. I noticed there are far fewer settings than Samsung. Most I never even used so I don't think anyone is missing much. I did like seeing ram usage and clearing background apps. Also, the stock Android has the ""back"" button on the left and I did not find a setting to switch it to the right like how it is on Samsung. It will take some getting used to. The finger print sensor, I have more good days with it than bad. Every once in a while I can't get it to read. It may be because of dirt but even after washing hands, sometimes it fails. Again, it's not any worse than Samsung's note 8. I have trouble with it at times. I finally listened to some music and watched videos on the Nokia. Comparing with my Note 8, the quality isn't the same. The speaker is loud enough but there's something about the sound. I may need to adjust the bass and treble settings. It seems like the sound is held back by the waterproofing of the phone. Also, there's no music app that comes preinstalled so you have to find your own. Update: July- 3 months later. Battery life is still great, the camera features are nice but I'm noticing more glitches especially when the battery is below 50%. I was at the beach last month. It wasn't too hot but sun was bright. The camera didn't work at all. It had to be the sunlight. Luckily I had my note 8 with me and I still got great pictures. Once we left and got in the car, camera was working fine. The biggest issue I'm having now is signal. Calls and messages go through fine but internet is so slow that I don't even bother using it. I have to be outside to get any picture on social media or an app to load. With WiFi I don't have issues but I don't have WiFi at work, where internet is very spotty. I will continue using the Nokia and try to adjust settings. Hopefully signal/internet issues get better. another update: July 6th. I figured out the problem with the camera. The light sensors are looking for an image but with bright sunlight the sensors get confused and turn the image completely white. All I had to do while in the pool was cover the camera with my hand and the image appeared. It's weird that I even have to do that to get the camera to work, but it works. Signal is still bad but at least I'm still receiving calls and text messages. I'll stick to the 3 star rating due to the phone being almost new and below standard signal coverage. If you read my initial review above, I was very excited about the great signal. Too bad it only lasted a few short weeks, if that. Excited to go back to Samsung soon.",69.0,Nokia,"Nokia 9 PureView - Android 9.0 Pie - 128 GB - Single Sim Unlocked Smartphone (at&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/H2O) - 5.99"" QHD+ Screen - Qi Wireless Charging - Midnight Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-PureView-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07N11SM58,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ls1kpJJsL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N11SM58,61,499.99,699.0
22361,B07N11SM58,EasyBeezy,2,15-Mar-19,True,"Edit - After six months, phone is worthless, glitchy, and broken. Camera is not good.","August update - after 5 months ownership. It came out in the news recently that many Nokia's were having trouble with their dataports becoming loose. As time went on my data connection between my phone and my car was becoming slow and would intermittently disconnect. This made using Android Auto basically impossible. The phone had also become generally unstable, with the ""flashlight"" becoming unreliable, the camera becoming unbearably slow (and the pictures it took being unremarkable at best), the battery life quickly deteriorating, the terrible fingerprint scanner remaining terrible, and apps would randomly open and crash in my pocket, causing big trouble. Also, the phone is flimsy and yields noticeably when squeezed, which is precisely what they instruct you to do when using the fingerprint scanner. I contacted Nokia to have the data port repaired under warranty. They made it somewhat easy to return it, sending me a label. However, I had to live without a phone for the time they had it, which was lengthy (two weeks). This was not doable for me, so I found a Galaxy s10 on sale for $499. OMG what a difference. Physically solid as a rock. Camera works swiftly and takes consistently better photos. Battery life is excellent. The OS runs as fast as my fingers can move, and everything just works. Fast forward two weeks and Nokia sends me an email saying they will not repair my phone because of ""liquid damage."" Only thing is, the phone has been exposed to very little liquid and is supposedly IP67 certified water resistant. It's never been submerged in any liquid. So because a glass of water got spilled in it's vicinity and it got a little wet (after the data port problem emerged), the phone is excluded from warranty coverage. So now I have a $700 worthless hunk of junk that I cannot sell. They are shady too. They sent one email saying they wouldn't cover it. Then, two minutes later, before I could even call and talk to them about it, they sent another email saying the phone was shipped out unrepaired and providing a tracking number. So they waited to tell me that they wouldn't help me until the phone was already out the door. I bought this phone because of my nostalgia for the quality products that NOKIA used to produce. However, this is NOT the same company. They just bought the name off of Microsoft for like $50. I will never touch another Nokia (HMD) product again. Previous review is below this line. The phone is for the most part as I expected it to be. Screen looks great, and the design is lovely, with one flaw. The glass seems to be formulated to retain the maximum amount of fingerprint grease possible. As soon as I removed the plastic protective covering, the back of the phone had my greasy prints all over it, and I hadn't even been eating my customary lunch of Frito's. Not too big a deal as I will be using a cover, but my last phone (Galaxy S7 Edge) had a similar glass back but it somehow resisted fingerprints. Speaking of fingerprints, it seems everyone is having trouble with the fingerprint scanner. Even professional reviewers are complaining. I also couldn't get it to work, at first. Coming from my old phone which had a perfectly reliable physical fingerprint scanner, this was disappointing. Then I discovered the secret, which is in plain sight. When the scanner fails, the phone asks you to press harder. Coming from a phone where a light touch was all it took, this was not intuitive. However, I tried press harder, but got no results. Then I pressed even harder, almost unnaturally hard, and it worked. Now I can get it to work every time. I just have to steadily increase the pressure with my thumb until it triggers.

14118,B071ZDQ6MV,Gregory Chu,1,15-Mar-18,True,Don't bother...laggy & SW bugs.,"Hoped this was going to be a good option for me as I've always had Android and I am not ok with paying over $500 for a cell phone. At first, I was very happy with the phone. The design aesthetic is on point; nice weight, size, aluminum housing, but after a few days things just started to annoy me. First thing I noticed was that the automatic network-provided time was acting up. It kept forcing me to EST although I'm PST. Eventually, I had to deselect the automatic updated time and manually select PST to make sure. After some time, I reverted to auto updated time and it worked until I went to Texas and time again reverted to EST. Never had this issue before with any other phone, and it's especially annoying when you travel and have no idea what time it is. It's also not ideal when you depend on your cell phone as your alarm clock. There aren't a lot of accessories available for this phone so I chose a screen protector that had decent reviews. The screen protector was not made of glass and it had a soft feel to it. The softness eventually led to some indentations but still worked. This review is not about screen protector but I noticed after installing, the added depth near the fingerprint reader created some reliability issues there. I'd keep tapping and it wouldn't recognize so I'd have to unlock with the dot pattern. Lastly, the phone got really slow and laggy very soon after getting it. I put in a Class 10 micro SD card as is recommended so I don't think it's related to that. I even noticed, while getting ready to return and wipe the phone, that after removing the screen protector, SIM and SD card, the phone stopped being so laggy. Not sure what's going on but I can't recommend this phone.

15557,B075FLG6MV,Douglas L.,4,15-Jun-18,True,Honest Thorough Review,"Opening the Nokia 2 was fun. I came from a galaxy s7 that I lost but couldn’t afford to replace. So I suppose I am comparing it to what I had before. The Nokia 2 design and first impression is amazing. Powering on the phone was quick to boot up. The battery came with 83% charge. The OS was extremely clean free of bloatware. Literally not even Nokia bloatware. All google software. Setting up was a breeze I have a gmail account. Everything was downloaded photos, old apps, contacts etc. took about 20 mins for my photos and such to come in (several hundred). I ran a game that would sometimes freeze up my old iPhone 5s and rarely my Samsung S7 called “Clash of Clans”. Just to stress the processor. Surprisingly the game loaded but not as quickly as in the S7 (yes I understand the Nokia has an entry level processor) the game played well. No freezing however under a heavy base attacks frames started to slow but not to where I would be frustrated. Next I tested the network speed on my carriers T-Mobile and ATT (personal and business). The Nokia 2 connects fine with both networks when I had the respect SIM card in. 25mps LTE band 12 on T-Mobile and 31 mps on band 4 on ATT. Phone calls are crystal clear and volume is robust however speaker phone and video watching the volume was a tad low for me through the single speaker. Battery life. 3 fulls days of use and game playing before I finally start to charge it. Battery life is the best I have ever had from a phone. I would assume the slower processor saves battery life. The only time the phone gets warm is on a charge. Overall this phone is a winner of your remember to close apps after using thing instead of letting them pile up likewise with browsers tabs. My daughter complained the phone was slow on loading videos for YouTube. Upon looking at the phone I noticed she had 13 YouTube videos loading at the same time on different chrome tabs. After I close all except the tab she was viewing the video zapped right in and started playing. Memory. This is where I deducted one star. After all of my google photos and apps finally downloaded along with a few required updates the phone had 2.1gb left out of 8gb. So adding an SD memory card is a no brained if you choose this device. It will take a 256gb SD Card.

3606,B00HWEMZ1E,Nick,5,15-Jun-14,False,Really good smartphone,"I got this phone around launch time. At that time I couldn't decide on the HTC ONE m7 or this phone. I chose this phone because I have had windows phone before (928) and liked it. The audio quality when listening through wired headphones with dolby on and an equalizer on sounds beautiful, I always go to my phone to listen to music. There are a lot of people and I mean a lot who look at windows phone and leave it almost instantly because of their app store. The app store has got more popular apps since early 2013. Tunein use to be junk but they fixed it so it works almost flawlessly, they have a good selection. But if you use your phone for a boat load of apps expecting the size of android or ios than the phone may not work with you unless you keep your old device to use the apps you did before. And the best part is that you can go to windowsphone.com to see what apps are there and what is not there. This phone is speedy, I have not had this phone freeze up or lag on me at all. I can sit there and play music and game at the same time on this phone. I know, you are thinking ""well pretty much any phone can do that"". Well here is my favorite part. Press a volume key like you are going to change the volume and you get a quick drop down of basic music controls to change track or pause while you are playing a game without leaving the game. The call quality on this phone is awesome. So is the antenna. When I am in a metal building I have 1-2 bars of 3g or 1x which is better than no bars. Text messages go through quick and when you are low on signal you may receive duplicate messages from a person, the phone does this just to make sure you got the message. Finding a screen protector may be a pain since the glass on this phone curves on the edges. Your best bet would be a wet install like skinomi or armor suit. For me, I use a tpu case with an armorsuit screen protector and it is a great combination. Though I really wish it was possible for someone to make a glass screen protector but that will probably never happen. Pictures and video are great on this phone. I use this phone to take pictures more than a seperate camera that I have because it is more convenient and still has great quality.

I so love my Nokia Lumia!Better than my android.I was a die hard fan of samsung galaxy but now am head over heels with windows phone platform. I gave it 4 stars because of just how hard it is to get it set up.It took me forever to : 1.Get my new windows live account verified.I kept getting an error to check my inbox to veirfy my account and no link to this day has ever arrived in my live account to verify it.That's a downside to Microsoft.After a little googling I realized it is not an isolated case.When you first sign up put an alternate email (gmail,yahoo) instead of phone for verification.The verification takes forever to arrive but once you get it you are good to go and download your apps. 2.Set up the the phone to receive and send pictures!I am on one of those cheaper phone networks AKA SIMPLE mobile.There are no clear instructions anywhere on how to set up the phone to receive data and picture messages(supposedly simple mobile/T-mobile says they have no way to set i up).I almost returned the phone because of this but lo and behold again google came to the rescue.After a few clicks and trial and error:before you do anything download the Nokia app :""Network Setup"" follow instructions for the other windows phones.Also under settings--> Cellular---apn=simple 3.Haven't been able to pair with my Honda CRV bluetooth Hands free link yet.Honestly I haven't been in the car long enough to fight this battle so this may just be a user error.

I love the design and feel of the phone. Hardware is solid and the phone is quite speedy. Software is as plain Android as you can get which is important for me. Problems surfaced when I started making calls. I'm on T-Mobile US in a well serviced area. Initially, I was happy to see that the Nokia 6 was connecting to LTE and operating with VoLTE out-of-the-box. However, after doing some test calls, I noticed a trend. I was having a very hard time getting the Nokia 6 to place a call to other T-Mobile US customers. Whenever I tried to call my wife, the phone would fail to connect on LTE, fall back to 3G, and possibly fall back to 2G before either connecting the call or simply hanging up (most of the time it would just hang up). If I call any other land line or cell phone on another carrier, the phone would immediately connect the call over VoLTE and have zero issues. No problems at all receiving calls; even from T-Mobile US customers. SMS/MMS and visual voicemail built-in to the dialer all work fine. I'm going to request a replacement. I will update this review if I have any success. TL;DR: Wonderful hardware and software experience.

The phone itself is fabulous; amazing camera, fast processor, beautiful display and extremely user friendly. It would be so much better if the phone wasn't on Verizon and or the Windows platform. The apps are either third party apps or simply don't compare to the same ones on Android or IOS. This phone was supposed to be updated to Windows 8.1 like all of the other Verizon Windows Phones but there have been nothing more than delays and seldom incredibly vague announcements regarding the update. You can manually update it but you will lose your warranty and I suggest keeping that because it already broke once on me. On top of that Windows has not been updating their apps like we were informed. I had made myself aware that it was supposed to grow immensely and be a great (not huge) platform, but they have dropped so many of their apps that I used. The next bad thing about this would be that Verizon had been pushing this phone for awhile as their Windows flagship phone but was cut in a very short amount of time.

I say one of the best not as a subjective matter or personal preference. If you were to pick a category and compare it, it will rate high on most and will come on top in a few others (ex. camera and video). Feel Quality and Design. The phone is really beautiful. I have got compliments from many people. It is not WOW, nor flashy (at least the black version); it is just elegant and clean. To be honest, I wasn't really sold on its design until I owned it. Even at the store I wasn't able to completely appreciate it. For me only the iphone 4 and 5 are as beautiful; That said, many people use covers/cases making the the whole design thing go out the window. Why craft so beautiful phones when you get to hide them under a case. To each its own. If you are careful, no need for covers, but anyway. It feels really good, durable, sturdy, not cheap at all. The iphone feels good too, but it tends to scratch easier than this one. Some HTCs feel good too, but their soft touch material gets dirty, so for feel, I would say this one and the iphones are on top. The only cons are its size and weight, but just in the beggining. You get used to it, believe me. My favorite phone of all time was the Motorola Razr V3. Not a smartphone, but almost the perfect size and weight. I was hesitant to go bigger than a 4"" screen, but I cave just to have the best Nokia was offering and because I wanted a windows phone. After a week, it becomes second nature and it doesn't bother me anymore. Camera and Video: Bar none, simply the best, especially at night and shooting video. My whole family are iphone and apple fans. For them to admit my phone took better pictures than their iphone 5 was huge. I thought they would have said its ok and move one, but they were actually impressed which speaks volume. Look at videos shot with the 920, there are several on youtube. The excellent camera and video hardware is the reason why the phone is heavier than most. I started to enjoy taking pictures when I got this phone. I never thought I was going to get into a phone because of its camera, but now that I have it, I am glad. Display: It is really good. I'm sure it may not be technically the best out there, but it is high resolution, high pixel density, blah blah blah; it is just very good. From the user perspective, this won't be a reason why not to buy this is phone, it is as good any other out there. You can use leather gloves with this phone, I have tried it and it is useful for me when in bad weather. Performance: Smooth and fast. Probably the fastest interface in the market, but that is due to Windows Phone, not so much the hardware. My previous phone, Samsung Focus was also fast with lesser hardware specs. One difference is when opening apps, Nokia's is faster and web surfing is a breeze. Battery: It seemed to have a break in period. Initially, for the first few days, it didn't hold past 16 hours of normal use. Some people where complaining about it. I also got one of the first phones back in November so they may have revised that. However, now, I charge it every other night with normal use. I usually have GPS and NFC turned off, screen brightness set to low, and I don't watch video on my phone except for rare ocassions. I turn LTE on and off as i am usually on wifi at home and office, so Wifi is always on. Bluetooth is always on. If i were to set everything on, I am sure I'll get a full day's charge with no problem. Software/OS: I fell in love with windows phone since I bought the first Samsung Focus that came with Windows Phone 7.0. I never liked Windows mobile. I can't remember what make me choose it in the first place. I remember I didn't want an iphone because everyone had one, and, at the time, didn't have many cloud features and integration that I wanted. I did, recognize at the time, it was the best smartphone on the market overall. I also didn't like you had to use itunes for everything. I was too close to buy an Android. What shy me away was that the interface had some lags and it lacked software upgrades. Google could not push upgrades unless you had the nexus. So I took a look at the focus, it looked good and fluid, and I liked the fact the everything I used (email, outlook at work, facebook, calendar,xbox, etc) all integrated in the phone and in the cloud and were not app dependent, so I took a leap of faith and never looked back. You really don't know how good windows phone is until you use it. Live tile is great, all the information comes to you, so you don't need to go into every individual app. You can customize the tiles in any way you want, what works for you. I don't even have to go past the lockscreen to see what's next on my calendar, check the weather, and whether I have a new email or not. They say it doesn't have a zillion apps and it is true. People talk about apps like quantity is what matters. Most of the good apps are in Windows Phone. For example, they may have the official facebook app + 3 copycats; iOS may have 15 copycats and Android 20. So it is easy to say the windows have only 4 apps, iOS 16 and Android 21. In pure numbers, Android wins, but how many facebook apps do you need? Even though there is a facebook app, you don't need one, becuase it is integrated with the phone. I don't remember an app I needed that I couldn't find except for the official Formula One timing app only available on ios, android and blackberry. The OS has many great features but you can look it up by yourself. Nokia support is great and they have some exclusive apps you will not find in any other phone, which makes it a plus. Don't be or believe a naysayer. the Iphone 4 and 5 are great phones. Some Android phones are great phones. If Windows and Nokia are not your cup of tea, it is fine, that is your choice. All I know is of all the people who try Windows Phones and especially the Nokia 920 fall in love with it. I told my girlfriend she should get an iphone since it is a great phone because it is tried and true and could be easier for her (she is not tech savvy) as it doesn't need personal customization. Iphone, it is more plug, dowload and play. Although Windows is easier to you by default, the experience is so much better once you personalize it. She liked my phone so much she went ahead and bought a Nokia 820 as she felt the 920 was too big for her hands. My Dad was bragging about being one of the first with iphone 5 last year, and when I showed my Lumia and what it could do, he was blowned away and wanted to exchange phones with me(not that I would have) and then his excuse to make himself feel better was the he didn't like the square edges of the 920.",9.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

Sometimes non-USA international versions are sold in the USA. Recently brought to market are USA versions with varying specifications locked to cell service providers. This review is for the unlocked USA version current as of the date of this review. I mention the version information because reviews and Q&As for different versions of some products are sometimes agglomerated together, which explains sometimes conflicting information. I've owned and used the phone for one month. I'm an average talk, text, email, and light internet browsing user. I like it and am content with my purchase. Solid reliable performance with very few issues so far, and issues were resolved fairly easily. Nokia customer service has been spectacularly excellent in speed, thoroughness, and patience in holding my hand to explain and advise regarding the very few issues I've had. I have used the phone with cell service from T-mobile, Simple Mobile, and Mint Mobile without problems or any noticeable differences in reliability and quality (note: I live in a heavily urban area). However, customer service quality for cell service providers varies greatly.

20559,B07HD3QC65,Jessica,1,15-Aug-19,True,Great value for less than a year means it isn't a great value at all,"I've seen the Nokia 7.1 still listed on ""best value"" lists for unlocked cell phones (as of August 2019). But I've only had reason to notice that because I'm needing to replace the 7.1 I've had for less than a year. All of the specs in the world don't matter if the phone's inability to charge makes it about as valuable as a skinny, glass-coated brick. This is where the input of long-term users is more valuable than that of tech reviewers. Search in these customer reviews, search the internet, you'll find widespread problems with the Nokia smartphone (not just 7.1) USB port/charging port. Starting two months ago, I noticed an odd amount of wiggle in the port when I went to plug the charger in. It got to the point where I'd have to put a certain amount of pressure on the cord and lay the phone *just so* for it to register a charge. Now I can't get it to consistently charge, no matter what I do, and even when the phone says it's charging, it isn't actually juicing up. On airplane mode, with a rubber band wrapped around the phone and cord to hold a particular tension, it will gain 3-4% of battery an hour. I basically can't unplug it for any respectable amount of time. This is a basic flaw that ruins the phone.

19361,B07DD71K4D,TechEnthusiast,5,14-Sep-18,True,"Excellent value for money, decent everyday workhorse","Beautiful phone, I got it in white and it feels smooth and matte as if it were made of ceramic. Great feel when holding, clearly sturdily built. Sadly it still uses a Micro USB connector, but I have so many of those cables that I don't totally care. Hopefully 2019 will be the year when we all switch to USB-C. For $160, you can't expect the performance of a $700-1000 phone. However, this phone is plenty fast for everyday tasks: it handles email, texting, calling, video calls, facebook, twitter, instagram and a bunch of other stuff very well. It's not instant fast, but it's fast enough that you never feel like it's lagging. The camera is OK in daylight, but like most phones, garbage at night. HDR photos are slow to snap, so I'd recommend leaving that option off. The screen looks great for the size, and Android One is clean, simple and fast. Compared to a couple years ago, you're getting a lot for $160. It's not the fastest option at this price: Huawei and Xiaomi definitely have better phones in this price range, but if you're on T-Mobile, you need bands 2/4/12 which those brands don't use. The alternative to the Nokia 3.1 is the Moto G6 play, and you know how Motorola is with updates: garbage. At least with this Nokia you're guaranteed 2 years of updates, meaning it'll get Android P pretty soon (as there's very little customization applied to the OS) AND also Q. If you want an everyday workhorse phone that handles all normal tasks well, this is a great phone.

I specifically wanted a Windows phone. The interface is great - intuitive and fairly easy to use. Set up was a snap. The only issue I had with this phone overall was sim card access. There is a small key you use to pop the latch to open the sim card slot. It is extremely difficult to make this work correctly. A google search will show that this is a common issue, and I hope Nokia has moved to address it in subsequent models. The phone is MUCH larger than my last one, but I waited 3 years to get a new one so that's not a surprise. I found it fairly easy to adapt to the new size. The screen size is great - I can actually surf with this one - and the touch screen is pretty responsive as well. The onscreen keyboard is easy to use. For base functionality, it's great. I find that the camera is excellent for portraits. I brought the phone to the beach when I took my granddaughters and got some extremely nice pictures - good enough to print and display.

1428,B00A2V7BA4,T. Tozawa,3,14-Nov-12,False,"Solid smartphone, smooth OS *2014 UPDATE*","*UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM* I switched from the iPhone 4 to Lumia 920 so if you're in the same situation and deciding whether to try a different OS/phone hopefully this review aids you in making a decision. I've been an iPhone user for a few years now starting from the 3GS and upgrading to the iPhone 4. I skipped the 4S in anticipation of the iPhone 5 but for me, it didn't seem like too big of a change (played with my brother's iPhone 5 for a bit) so I ended up keeping the iP4. The iP4 did everything that I wanted in a smartphone; I am not a heavy user but used it for your basic text, email, web/media browsing, and used a handful of apps, along with a jailbreak to customize certain features. But I was itching to try something new and the Lumia 920 piqued my interest. Since I'm into DSLR photography the PureView camera and optical stabilization intrigued me. I've done a few test shots and overall, the quality is great, especially with low light capture, and the optical stabilization is a great feature. As of now (Nov. 14, 2012) there is some talk of soft photos but nothing extreme, and it seems that Nokia is working on a software update to fix this issue. The half-press of the camera button engages auto focus and the optical stabilization kicks in, just like a DSLR, so usability is excellent. You can also adjust certain settings such as ISO and EV for more creative control. The overall build quality is superb, but with Nokia, that's pretty standard. The screen is bright and beautiful and watching HD content is a pleasure. The matte finish of the black feels great and looks sophisticated, but of course for the more adventurous there are more color options to choose from. The main critique of the phone was it's weight and coming from the iP4, it basically feels the same. Of course, if you're comparing it the iP5 or some of the other smartphones it may feel a lot heavier. Personally, I like having the weight as it feels more comfortable to hold and use. Your mileage may vary, but honestly, the weight issue is completely overblown. I was a little worried about the feel of the user interface on Windows Phone 8 after using iOS all these years. But after trying it out, it was pretty much second nature since the general feel and UI is similar to iOS. The customizable live tiles are great for organizing your home screen and keeping you up to date with what you want (and removing things you don't want.) The overall Windows Phone 8 OS is super smooth and quick compared to what I was use to on my iP4, which I already thought was nice and quick. I'm sure that there may be a few nitpicks and features not yet included that may bother certain users and for me, that one feature is the lack of a notification center. It seems that Microsoft couldn't include it in time and hopefully they'll push out an update that'll add this feature. The one thing about switching to the Windows platform that may bother users is of course app selection. It really isn't as bad as others make it out to be though and I would say that 90% of the main apps found on iOS/Android are found on the Microsoft store. Some apps may not be as fully featured (yet) but hopefully with the push of the Windows 8 ecosystem developers will start concentrating more on this platform. As I've read, developers are liking how easy it is to work on the platform so I wouldn't be surprised if in the near future the Microsoft marketplace will become just as robust as it's competitors. If all you download are gaming apps, then I would say that the Apple store definitely has the edge right now. The Apple store does has a lot of junk apps, but if you're looking for variety, the Microsoft marketplace still falls behind in that category at the moment. Personally I don't do a whole of gaming so that doesn't bother me but it may bother others. For any other app, they'll most likely be found on the Windows platform or there'll be a similar app that performs the same functions (and may even be better.) I haven't used the Nokia Music player too much but one glaring feature missing is the ability to scan through a song; you can only fast forward. This can be a deal breaker for some who like to use their smartphone as their sole music player. But other than that, controls are intuitive and the user interface is very solid. Some final points about the phone; the wireless charging is a great feature. Since I always lay my phone down on my computer desk, I can now just plop it down on the charging plate on the desk and it'll charge without fiddling with any cables. Sure it would only takes a few quick seconds to plug a cable in but it's small features like this that add to the phone. Battery life is decent and a full day with normal text, email, web/video browsing, and gaming use I'll be at around 40%. In standby I don't notice the battery draining super quick. There does seem to be some complaints right now of battery drainage but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Since I'm still new to the phone and constantly playing with it, I'm sure the battery usage can be better if I just used it normally. If you are heavily into the Apple ecosystem it may be a bit tougher to change to a different platform. But the iPhone 4 was my only Apple product so the switch wasn't troublesome by any means. In the end, I have no regrets in changing from the iPhone 4 to the Lumia 920. Sure there may be a few things missing but nothing that I can't adjust to and nothing bad enough to not warrant a review less than five stars. It's a superb phone with an equally amazing OS and using it is a pleasure. Silky smooth, great handling, and easy usability. Microsoft has the resources to make this platform work so I'm not too worried about updates, etc. I also remember my first mobile phone being the Nokia 5110 which was pretty much the equivalent of the iPhone back in the day (in terms of popularity.) Nokia makes great products so I'm not worried about the reliability or quality. Hopefully more users step out of their comfort zones to try something different. I'm glad I did and do not regret my decision at all. *UPDATE (11/25/2012)* I've owned this phone since launch and after using it daily for 2 weeks I have to downgrade my review from 5 stars to 4 stars. The main problem as reported by others is the battery. The first day or two after launch I had no problem with battery drainage. But after a while, I noticed random significant battery drainage during idle. Sometimes I would lose up to 20% in one hour without any change in settings or apps. I tried turning off some features such as NFC, Wi-Fi, etc. but the random battery drainage would continue. Checking the battery setting, I would sometimes get around 15 hours of battery time remaining at 100% and sometimes at around 70% I'll get 11 days of remaining battery time. It seems all over the place. Also, sometimes while charging the battery, it would randomly stop charging. On one occasion I left the phone plugged into the USB charger overnight and when I woke up it was below 10% since it had stopped charging. Another time I used the wireless charger and it did the same thing. I also noticed that the back of the phone would sometimes get abnormally hot while using it and/or charging. I'm aware that using the phone and/or charging can put a load on the battery but it got uncomfortably warm, something I never encountered while using my iPhone 4. Another thing are the live tiles. They're great but seem to work randomly. I know that certain apps only update in certain intervals but the OEM loaded Weather Channel app doesn't seem to update anymore until I go into the app. I had no problems with the app for the first week or so and haven't changed any settings regarding that app so I have no idea what could be wrong with it. There seems to be some problems with the overall OS/firmware that needs to be addressed at this point. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. Fortunately I have access to a battery charger during my day to day use so I can charge it when I need to, but if you rely on having long battery life without the option of being able to readily charge it, it could be a problem. I really hope Nokia/Microsoft push out an update that fixes this issue soon. *UPDATE (12/03/2012)* Just another update. It's been about a month since I've been using the phone and I still love it. After letting the battery discharge completely once, the battery performance seems to be better and more consistent. I did have one random reboot but generally speaking, in my day to day use, I haven't had any problems. I've gotten so use to the smoothness and speed of the OS that when I sometimes use my iPhone 4 it just doesn't feel like it reacts as quickly. I did originally dock a star after I noticed the battery problems but have bumped it back up since it seems to have stabilized. There are still a handful of apps that I'd love developers to put more effort into or create on the WP8 platform, but for most things I've find other apps or workarounds. I still don't have any regrets on this phone purchase and will update if I have anything else to add. *UPDATE (06/27/2013)* So it's been over half a year and I'm still using and enjoying my Lumia 920. Over time, there's been a few updates and a lot of official apps are starting to hit the marketplace making the user experience better. I'm still eagerly waiting for the Windows Phone Blue update later in the year/next year which should bring a lot good features such as double-tap to wake, FM radio, and hopefully a notification center. Still, at this point in time, my experience using WP8 has overall been good having switched from using iOS for 5+ years. However, just the other day my Lumia 920 developed a vertical cyan line running down the left-hand side of the screen. It seems that several other users have had this problem occur, although they reported it much sooner after buying the phone. I'm sure I could send it out to Nokia but having the downtime is too much of a hassle. For now I'll have to live with it and since new LCD's are going for around $50 I may just go ahead and replace it on my own if it gets to be too much of an annoyance. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed. I know problems can occur but all the previous smartphones I've owned had no problems within the 2-year contract I usually sign up for and to have this phone malfunction within half a year leaves a bad taste. *UPDATE (02/12/14)* There's been a lot of updates to Windows Phone and the latest updates have added some nice features such as ""glance"", ""double-tap"" to wake, etc. The upcoming 8.1 update that'll include a notification center and quick settings should make the OS overall much more solid. After a year and a half the OS has progressed nicely. A lot of apps have been releasing and that void is still filling up nicely. Although, there is still a lack of good support from all developers as iOS and Android still get priority in terms of features. I still feel that WP8 is a great OS and it's evolving nicely but I've personally been aching to switch back to iOS. The breaking point is pretty much that the Lumia 920's camera has now malfunctioned, causing a black screen with unresponsive buttons. A hard reset has done nothing so now the only option would be to get it fixed/replaced. The camera was one of the main selling points of getting this phone so it's a shame. With only a few months left on contract and a slew of new phones coming out, I've pretty much decided to switch back to iOS or try Android at this point. Like I've mentioned before, I've had no problems with my previous smartphones (iPhone 3GS and 4) but in the close to two years of owning this Nokia, the LCD screen has failed and now the camera. I know there'll be a few more manufacturer choices if I wanted to stay with WP8 (Samsung and Sony should have WP8 phones soon), but Nokia is suppose to be the high-end and all these problems leave a bad impression. I've docked a star, making the original 4-star to a 3-star rating for the Lumia 920 because of these problems. It was fun while it lasted and maybe down the road I'll try Windows Phone again since it really is a solid OS.",80.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
1475,B00A2V7BA4,Bacchus,5,14-Nov-12,False,Incredible Phone!,"Where to start? There are just so many good things about this phone and the Windows Phone 8 OS that it is tough to know where to start. I suppose I should start out by stating that I am somewhat of a Windows ""fanboy"" for lack of a better word. I am all in when it comes to Microsoft products owning the Xbox 360, Surface RT tablet, Windows 8 Pro laptop and of course Windows Phone. That being said I do try to rate products fairly but I wanted you the reader to know that there may be some bias in my review. I have owned several Windows Phones over the past few years. The Samsung Focus, Focus 2, HTC Titan, Lumia 900 and now the Lumia 920. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of the phones but the 920 certainly stands out as to what I feel is finally a true competitor to the Iphones and Samsungs of the world. This phone has some serious specs and can hold its own against its rivals when it comes to pure processing power. Everything is super smooth on this phone. Apps launch quickly, the internet is super speedy thanks to the LTE and the camera snaps pic after pic without a stutter. I finally feel that my phone isn't preventing me from doing anything that I want to do with it. I am very impressed with the power and speed of the 920. SCREEN: The screen is just gorgeous. It has a super high resolution which makes everything look soooo good. Text is easy to read and pictures just come to life (corny but true!) The screen also has a super sensitive mode where you can actually wear winter gloves and still control the phone as normal. It is pretty amazing the first time I tried this. You can also shut this off so you have complete control as to whether to use it or not. CAMERA: If you like to take pictures with your phone then this really is the phone for you. Nokia has done some amazing things with their camera technology here. The image stabilization for photos and videos is second to none. I have pretty shaky hands but all my pics and vids come out super smooth with this phone. The night time is where the camera tech really shines. Whether you are indoors or outdoors with poor to almost no light this camera still takes really bright and clear pics! It really is a must have feature if you like to take pics. The camera on this phone has replaced my need for a separate point and shoot camera. No joke. It is that good. If I were to critique the camera in any way it would be to say that the pics sometimes come out a little ""soft"" when taking pics during the day. Nokia has already stated that they plan a soon to be released update that allows for sharper pics so that negative could very well vanish in the near future. SOUND: I have never really been impressed with the sound quality of any phone I have ever had as far as playing music through the speakers without headphones. It is no different for me with the 920. The stereo speakers are ok but I wouldn't recommend listening to music without headphones. Once you do hook up your favorite pair of headphones the sound is much improved. Nokia uses Dolby Headphone technology and the sound the phone produces while using earbuds is impressive. The volume isn't the loudest but definitely loud enough to easily block out any outside noises. Also, no earbuds come with the phone. CALL QUALITY: So far I have no complaints with the call quality. When I ask people how I sound they say everything sounds good. I can also hear them easily and clearly through the earpiece. I am not a huge phone user on my phone (doh!) but so far I have had a very pleasant experience on calls. BATTERY LIFE: So far I am getting better than expected battery life. I thought with LTE I would be burning through a charge in 4 or 5 hours but so far I am easily making it through an entire work day with moderate use. I can take the phone off the charger at 5:30 AM and when I go to bed at around 10 or 11 at night I still have about 15-25 percent left. To me that is more than adequate. The battery does seem to get a bit warm when playing games or really pushing the LTE but I think that is pretty normal for these powerful phones. WIRELESS CHARGING: I purchased my 920 through an ATT store which was running a promotion for a free wireless charger. The 920 has that ability built right into the phone! It is pretty darn useful too. I keep the charging plate right on my nightstand and when I am done reading in bed I just place it on the pad and it starts to charge. No need to fumble with cords. BUILD QUALITY: This is one SOLID phone. I don't plan on dropping it but I would have to say that I would worry more about what I drop this on then the phone itself. This actually leads to what may be a downside for some people. The phone, compared to other phones, is a little heavier. I don't find it to be an issue and in fact like the strong feel of the phone but go to the store and check it out because some have noted that it bothered them. APPS: The Lumia 920 comes with Nokia Drive which is a really nice navigation app that easily compares to the paid version out there. I have used it a bunch of times and it has worked flawlessly every time. You also get a Microsoft Office suite which includes PowerPoint, Word, Excel and One Note. While I don't see myself creating complex spreadsheets on a phone it certainly is nice to be able to open and edit if I need to. OK, it looks like I rambled on way too long.

1683,B00A2V7BA4,D. Johnson,4,14-Nov-12,False,Excellent phone!,"I've had my Lumia 920 since the day they were launched by AT&T. Overall, I love it, though it isn't perfect. The best parts about the phone are Windows Phone 8. This will probably sound strange to people who haven't ever used the Windows Phone OS, but Microsoft has done a phenomenal job of producing a phone that is fast, easy to use, and extremely personal and social. iOS and Android don't even come close to the level of integration that Microsoft has achieved with social networks, which makes WP8 the best choice for someone who is using their phone to keep in contact with friends. The ability to have full integration with Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, and now Skype isn't matched on any other OS. If the reason you're buying a smartphone is to keep in contact with people on social networks, Windows Phone is clearly your best choice. I have several coworkers with iPhone 5s and quite a few with high-end, recent Android models as well. The 920 is much more responsive than the Android models, and probably faster and smoother than the iPhone 5 as well. There is absolutely no lagging in response to input. The touch screen is incredibly responsive and snappy. You're never left wondering if the phone received your input because it just responds instantly. Microsoft makes much of the Live Tiles, and probably rightfully so. Being able to configure your start (home) screen with up-to-date news, weather, sports scores, social network updates, etc. is just awesome. While it may be true that Android has the ability to add gadgets to do some of these things, they are somewhat finicky to deal with. And iOS lacks any ability to have dynamic content on the home screen. Microsoft really has an edge on other OS vendors here. The Nokia apps are also a big plus. The Maps app is the best I've seen on any phone, and its ability to download map data onto the device makes it extremely fast, as well as being completely usable in areas with no coverage. Nokia Music is a lot like Spotify, Pandora, or Xbox Music Pass, but without any fees and the ability to work offline. Nokia Drive turns your phone into a completely usable GPS which is good enough to replace many budget dedicated units. And City Lens is just... cool. Holding up and moving your phone around to see what businesses are nearby impresses people every time I demonstrate it. Not everything is rosy, though. While Windows Phone now boasts more than 120,000 apps, not all of the popular apps from other platforms are available. In fact, many are not. This may or may not be important for you, because in most cases where a popular app from iOS or Android may not be available, a suitable alternative most likely is. And Microsoft seems to be trying really hard to engage app developers in including Windows Phone in their software development plans. With Windows Phone 8 they have made it easier than it was with version 7, as the ability to run native apps has been added, making porting from other platforms much easier to do. Hopefully this results in more first-run titles coming to the platform. I also think that the 920 is just a bit too big. The screen size is perfect, but the phone overall is just a bit thick, and a little bit heavy by today's standards. It seems from tear-downs that the likely culprit is the internal module for wireless charging, which is adding a bit of extra girth to the device. Some people will love having that ability, while others may have been willing to give it up to end up with a device that's been on a diet. Either way, it isn't any heavier or thicker than phones from just a year ago, so if you've read reviews on the internet complaining about how obese the phone is, you can probably safely assume that it isn't any chunkier than the phone you already have. Weight-wise, it's almost identical to the iPhone 4/4S. Some significant advantages the 920 has over other phones are its excellent camera (which is arguably the best available short of the PureView 808) and wireless charging. Amazon doesn't seem to be selling the Nokia branded wireless chargers, but any Qi compatible charger will work. This includes an LG model that is currently just $35. Having NFC on the phone is also very cool, even if AT&T doesn't yet support it for making wireless credit card purchases using the Isis service. The biggest downsides to the 920 are its exclusivity to AT&T (which tends to have mediocre coverage in most areas), the lack of expandable storage, and a battery that cannot be removed. While the 920 seems to do a better job at pulling in signals than many other phones, if quality coverage isn't available there just isn't that much that a phone can do to improve it. And it seems that a premium phone wouldn't be skimping on features that are available on lower-end models. The 820, for example, does have expandable storage. I also find the battery life to be acceptable, but not great. If you're actively using the phone for anything that is very CPU intensive (like a Skype video call) you can almost hear a sucking noise coming from inside the phone as the battery is drained very quickly. For normal use though, you'll get more than a day out of a charge. Overall the 920 is an excellent (but not perfect) smartphone. It is likely the best choice for someone using a phone for keeping up on their social networks, and it is a great phone for practically everything else.

CONCLUSION: Laying aside the nitpicking, I am in love with my Lumia. There are so many great phones today that it has become a problem to choose one. But the top WP8 phone is the choice by both my brain and my heart. If I were a bit geekier, I might have gone with Android; and if I didn't have to work I might have gone with iPhone. But this is my phone. It's for a practical man with a taste. I hesitated when Lumia 800 came out, knowing that it would be incompatible with WP8. Now Lumia 920 is such an attractive package. I don't think I'll change my phone anytime soon, although I do hope that there would be some nice updates from both Microsoft and Nokia to make this phone even better. 1. CALL QUALITY It is a phone after all. The call quality of Lumia 920 is absolutely top-notch. The voice is so clear it puts my landline cordless phone to shame. Nokia knows how to make phones. They are the true phone company. The HAAC microphones (Rich Recording Mic) are not your ordinary microphones on cell phones. A different league. The speakerphone is pretty good too, quite loud and clear. In fact I once had a conference call using the speakerphone with several people on my side, and it worked out fine. 2. E-MAIL Overall, WP8 has the best mobile e-mail. Windows Phone has an inherent advantage in e-mail, especially work e-mails. Apple does not own a popular e-mail service, and can only support third-party e-mails. Android enjoys the excellent Gmail, but Gmail does not have a strong foothold in the workplace. WP8 has deep integration of Exchange, Office 365's Outlook e-mail, Hotmail and Live Mail on Windows Phone. WP8 further has excellent integration with the popular Gmail and Yahoo Mail. All this results in an e-mail client that is more capable and efficient than other platforms. To name a few, contact management, contact synchronization, message management, message synchronization, file management, attachment management, folder management, conversation thread management, and e-mail search, are significantly better on Windows Phone e-mail. The difference is far deeper than appearance. If you handle e-mails with some degree of sophistication, you will appreciate the difference. I travel with both my iPad and Windows Phone. Unless I am using my computer, I usually reach out for the Windows Phone for e-mails instead of the iPad, despite the fact that the e-mails on iPad have so much better readability. This wasn't the case before when I used an iPhone. To just read a recent e-mail, the iPad is an obvious choice. But you don't just read a recent e-mail. Work e-mails have history and threads, and they need to be searchable, and fully synchronized with your computer, and that's where the Windows Phone shines. For example, if you just read or deleted an e-mail on you phone, you want the status to synchronize with the server and other devices, otherwise you end up paying attention to the same e-mail too many times or having to delete the same e-mail multiple times. For another example, if you need to search to find an older e-mail which is not stored on your phone (due to memory conservation, mobile devices do not download and keep a copy of every e-mail in the past), you want your mobile e-mail to give you an opportunity to search e-mails on the server. WP8 does these perfectly. I also like the fact that Windows Phone has a separate live tile with a customized icon for each e-mail account. I don't like the idea of mixing my work e-mail and personal e-mail in the same box, or even under the same icon. I need a clean definition of territories. Of course, if you intend to combine e-mails, you can do that as well on WP8. Flexibility. 3. SKYPE AND NON-CELLULAR SERVICE DEPENDENT PHONE CALLS Skype, owned by Microsoft now, is an important function on WP. Microsoft also makes a Skype app for iOS, but the app is still not nearly as good as the integrated Skype on the Windows Phone. If you use Skype Pro and/or Skype Out, you can actually make phone calls anywhere in the world as long as you have Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. I'm not talking about Skype-to-Skype calls. I'm talking about calling real phone numbers. (This works only with Skype Pro; the free Skype account can only make online Skype calls). No cellular phone connection is required with Skype Pro on Windows Phone. Take an international trip you will understand what I'm saying. Being able to call home and work at international airports *without* a SIM card for the local service is a major convenience. Even if you already have got a local SIM card, using Skype Pro on Windows Phone to make calls on the 3G/4G data service is still a great convenience because it costs only two cents a minute, less than 1/20 of the cost for international calls made on a regular cell phone. It also works other way around. You can make international calls from the US using Skype Pro on your Windows Phone for two cents a minute. Cheap international calls anywhere on your cell phone (and enjoying the integrated phone contacts) - I hope this concept registers with you. 4. CONTACT MANAGEMENT The People Hub on the Windows Phone deserves a separate mentioning. This is by and large the best contact management on a cell phone (WebOS users might have an issue with the statement). It automatically integrates all the contacts from different sources (e-mails, Skype and Facebook) and provides the best accessibility and connectivity on a mobile device. This significantly betters iOS, which has a pretty address book and good editing capabilities, but very little beyond that. When it comes to multi-source contacts integration, accessibility and connectivity, the People Hub on WP is much superior to iOS's contact management. For example, iOS address book has links to internal phone numbers and e-mail addresses, but basically that's it. It does not have active links to external phone numbers (e.g.,contacts pulled from e-mail accounts), Skype contacts, and Facebook friends, etc.. In the People Hub, all these have active links, meaning that they provide a single click connection. In addition, People Hub pulls contacts from Skype, which iOS does not do at all. If you use Skype, especially Skype Pro, you'd suffer a disconnection on iOS. Both address books link contact addresses to maps, but the Apple maps is essentially dysfunctional in this respect. Apple hasn't really spent time to make sure this function actually works (they have been focused on making the thing look pretty). It doesn't work most of the time. Unless you have entered the contact address in a particular manner, clicking the address will result in a ""not found"" on the maps. The People Hub works perfectly with maps. Under the hood, this is actually a search algorithm issue, not a user interface issue. Like Google, Microsoft knows search. It shows. 5. PRODUCTIVITY Windows Phone 8 wins this important area hands down, not because it is so good, but because others are so bad. The major thing is the Office App and OneNote App, and their integration with the excellent and generous (but underrated) SkyDrive. This allows Windows Phone to do the most essential things for productivity. WP8 further integrates Office 365 and SkyDrive perfectly. If you or your company subscribe to Office 365 and use the cloud versions of the OneNote, Office, Outlook, TeamSite and SharePoint, the productivity is boosted to a whole new level. The iPhone and Android simply cannot provide that kind of productivity. Even if you don't use Office 365, getting the Windows Live and Skydrive would already be the best productive user experience because of the integration with the Web version of Office. I hear people say that they can use an Office-emulating app to do some work on the iPhone (or Android). But no. For serious work, it simply doesn't work. You open a document (Word or PowerPoint, for example), do a slight editing, thinking that you have saved a bit time working on your smart phone, but only to later discover (or be told by an upset colleague) that you changed the subtle aspects of the formatting and styling of the document. That doesn't work for me, nor for anyone I work with. Work environment cannot allow this. The fundamental difference is that the Office App on WP8 and Office Web version have complete compatibility with the traditional Office, while other apps don't. They are built on different foundations. Microsoft's mobile renditions of Office may lack many features of the full Office, but they are completely compatible with it, and that's extremely important. When it comes to work documents, compatibility is more important than feature set. Overall, if documents and e-mails are just different ways of casual ""instant messaging"" to you, the iPhone is fine. But if documents and e-mails are a work tool to you, Windows Phone is the way to go. 6. NAVIGATION First of all, for those who miss Bing Maps, your Windows Phone still has it. It's only two taps away: tap the Bing search button (hardware button on the right side at the bottom), and then tap the ""Local Scout"" button (on the left side of the three on the search page). In addition to Bing Maps, Nokia offers a set of navigation apps including Nokia Maps, Nokia Drive, Transit, and City Lens. They together offer excellent navigation, better than Bing Maps alone, and also better than what iOS has to offer. Apple's first map is actually impressive with good features and of course great looks. But as Google has said, doing maps is hard. It's years of exercise versus a morning makeup. Currently, Apple Maps does have a problem. The reports of Apple's terrible map performance are related to map data inaccuracy and map search algorithms. Those Apple fans who refute such reports by claiming that they haven't experienced any problems are missing the point. Unlike other software in which a test is usually universal, your map test results only have to do with the location you tried, and only proves that the map is OK in that one location. When there is a problem at another location, there is a problem. And Apple has a lot of such problems reported. The company acknowledges it. They're not fools. I don't know how fast Apple can improve on that. Data and fundamental algorithms are far more than just doing some programming to add skins. They might need to shell out a billion dollars to buy up. Compared to the excellent Google Maps, Nokia's navigation solution is mixed. It's worse in some ways, but better in other ways. Google shines on map data, especially in the North America segment, no question about it. Google's superiority in search is also reflected in its maps. The app overall feels more mature and advanced, further boosted by is far greater user base (which they earned). But Nokia has several important things on its side. The segmented downloadable maps for off-line GPS is a unique and significant advantage for Nokia. The reliable integration with contact addresses (People Hub) is another. The multi-angle approach of Nokia's navigation app set suits user's particular need better. Nokia also has comparable map data (although arguably slightly inferior North America segment) and mature map algorithms. Nokia's navigation solution comes with several separate apps. In comparison, Google puts everything under Google Maps. I like Nokia's way of tasking. The Nokia apps are meant to be connected (they need to work more on that). You start with one app, but may transit to another when you need it. If done right, Nokia's approach could directly put the user at the best leveraging angle depending on the actual situation, using a specific app with the most suited user interface to maximize the user experience. Some people complain about it either because of their unfamiliarity with this design or their dissatisfaction with the current execution. I hope Nokia doesn't change this good concept, but just keeps on perfecting the apps and improving the integration under this framework. An often overlooked but significant feature Nokia offers is downloadable maps segmented according to regions. Once downloaded to your phone's local storage, the maps are fully functional off-line even when you don't have any cellular network or WiFi access. That could be a matter of getting or not getting to the destination. If you don't think this is important, I don't know what is. Even when cellular network is present, the off-line GPS map means big savings on your data usage. With the downloaded maps, the navigation on Lumia 920 may replace standalone GPS units. It has vastly better user interface to start with. Address search, which is probably the most frustrating thing on standalone GPS units, is far better on Nokia Drive. The overall user experience is superior despite its lack of a few features. But if you need a dedicated GPS unit constantly mounted in the car, that's a different story. If you happen to be at a place without a car (Americans, have you traveled to other places in the world? People don't always drive), try Nokia Transit, which provides detailed guide for public transportation of cities around the world. Nokia takes navigation seriously. They have had an excellent maps tradition and accumulated expertise with Symbian-based cell phones. Considering that they jumped on the WP ship only recently, I'm confident that they will make this whole thing even better in a quite fast pace. 7. THE SCREEN Both Lumia 920 and iPhone 5 have gorgeous screens, but the Lumia is still better. The viewability under direct sunlight is noticeably better on Lumia 920. Both are extremely clear for text and webpage rendering, but Lumia 920 works much better in the portrait mode because of its greater viewing dimension. And Lumia 920 has touchscreen capability when you wear gloves. This may come handy in very cold winter outdoors. But for me, the usefulness is more than during the winter. To protect my hands from suffering painful skin and split fingernails, I often need to wear a glove on my right hand while I'm doing air traveling. Lumia 920 is the only phone that I can use wearing a glove. It is not a gimmick at all. 8. THE CAMERA Lumia 920 has the best cell phone camera on the market, leading by a significant margin, except for Nokia's own PureView 808 which is a different type of device. I say this very objectively. Those who don't see the difference either didn't test it under right conditions, or simply can't tell the differences in photo quality. Lumia 920 is the only smartphone camera that can take decent concert (or party) photos and videos. Its lowlight performance is at least two ISO stops (that's 4 times) better than the iPhone 5. This is primarily due to Nokia's unique pixel binning technology further combined with image stabilization. Neither Nokia nor Apple makes the camera sensors (Sony does), but the photo quality is not only about the sensor itself. Nokia has a tremendous technological and patent advantage in this area. By the way, stop comparing which camera has more megapixels. High MP is a trick used by camera makers to tax on consumer ignorance, and in most cases has very little correlation to picture quality. On cell phones in particular, there are several reasons why it's meaningless to pursue higher MP count. First, no tiny lens on a cell phone is capable of optically resolving pixel numbers beyond 5MP. I challenge you to find a scientific test to prove otherwise. Second, because of the very small sensor sizes, low light performance is a far bigger problem than the number of pixels. Third, you don't need more than 2MP on a cell phone. Generally, photos taken by smart phones are only used for screen viewing instead of making large prints. Even 2MP would be plenty. For web posting, a high-quality 1MP photo would look far better than a lousy 10MP photo. I'm not saying that a smaller pixel number is a good thing in itself. On the contrary, I'm just saying that for a given sensor technology, pixel density is the best sacrifice to make if the goal is to take better pictures with a cell phone camera sensor. Most consumers don't realize that for any given sensor technology, an increase of pixel density comes at the expense of lowlight performance and dynamic range. (Many people intuitively reject this notion, reasoning that it does not make sense that lowlight performance and dynamic range would be affected by pixel density as you can always downsample. But to understand this, you must stop treating pixels as abstract geometrical concepts but actual engineered photosites with optically dead physical boundaries. That is a different topic though.) Every time when the sensor chip technology is improved, they usually have two options: (1) increase the lowlight performance and dynamic range by keeping the same pixel density, or (2) increase the pixel density (to get a greater MP count for a given sensor size) by holding back the real performance. Unfortunately they usually choose the latter because the MP count is a much more marketable gimmick. So instead of honest value, we now have the madness of smartphones reaching and going beyond 10MP with little meaningful result but unnecessarily bad lowlight performance, poor dynamic range, and a big waste of storage, data usage and processing time. Had they focused on real performances on 2-4MP sensors with a generous sensor size permissible on smartphones, we would have now had much more useful cameras on these gadgets. In this regard, Nokia is doing great in spite of (not because of) joining the megapixel race, again thanks to its pixel binning technology and image stabilization. 9. BUILD QUALITY Nokia 920 is a marvelous piece of engineering and manufacturing. Both Nokia 920 and iPhone 5 have a premium appearance, only very different flavors. But the Nokia is without question tougher. I say this not because Nokia is heavier. They use different materials. In choosing materials, these two companies have very different philosophies. Apple always goes after materials that enable extremely slim and light products, while Nokia has always been concerned of durability. If you are already conditioned to update your phone every year, you are an ideal Apple-kind person already. But still, hold your iPhone dearly and don't drop it. I have an iPad 3 that was accidentally dropped from a sofa sidetable to a hard floor head-down. I was completely shocked by the amount of damage it caused. I was expecting a dent on the edge or at worst a crack on the screen, but the whole thing was smashed like glass. That's when I discovered that the iPod 3 uses a glasslike material even for the frame, which looks great, but, just don't drop it. So you might actually need a case for your iPhone. Lumia 920 does not need one. In fact, I can't imagine a case for Lumia 920 without ruining its gorgeous appearance. 10. THE DESIGN This is completely subjective. But I personally feel iPhone 5 is too youthful and delicate, and better in a hand of a teenager, while the Samsung Galaxy S3 too rounded and has no character. I love the overall masculine (but gentle and absolutely not rough) and squarely straight style of Lumia 920. Go to YouTube to hear Marko Ahtisaari of Nokia articulating the design philosophy. 11. THERMAL BEHAVIOR AND BATTERY LIFE The Nokia 920 does not run hot, thankfully. This is one thing I was particularly worried after the bad experience with the Dell Venue Pro which had disgusting thermal performance and power management. Battery life is good, although not excellent, comparable to other top performers such as iPhone 5. If there would be an improvement that could persuade me to change my phone again, it would be a new phone that could last at least a couple of busy days without recharging. I am not a heavy mobile user, but I'm out on a trip quite often. The battery life of my cell phone is among the biggest mental burdens while traveling. Unfortunately, it looks like battery life is not what these companies are focusing on at this time. 12. APPS iPhone wins by a large margin in terms of app number. Although a vast majority of apps are junk on both systems, there are some great apps on both; iOS just has more due to its sheer larger base. So it seems that most people will need to sacrifice a few apps by choosing Windows Phone platform for now. I'm missing quite a few useful apps on the Windows Phone, and make up the deficiency by using the iPad. Windows Phone also has some very good apps that are missing on iOS (in addition to Nokia apps and Microsoft apps), although not as critical. The most important app I miss on the Windows Phone is a decent PDF reader. Microsoft rushed out its own PDF reader, which works for basic reading but has some serious limitations. I hope Adobe or a third-party releases a better PDF reader on WP8 soon. This is a big pain point. However, none of these missing apps has the kind of importance comparable to that of navigation and productivity. To me, the choice is clear. I think it's misleading to do ""bean counting"" the small things of each system. You've got to have priority. If you need one function that has a dominating priority, then one million less useful ""apps"" would no longer matter. Despite the relative minor changes in appearance from WP7 to WP8, Windows Phone 8 has got a much better foundation in the program architecture than WP7. With the Windows NT kernel and 90% source code compatibility with Windows RT, the app future looks good. 13. FLUENCY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM Windows Phone 8 on Lumia 920 beats iOS on iPhone 5 in terms of fluency and efficiency. WP has a hardware ""Back"" button in addition to the Home button, while iPhone has just a Home button. This has a significant impact on the flow of operation. I know this is rather subjective, but one thing that particularly bothers me on the iOS is that it requires you to always go back to the home button. You can't directly go back to another place you have just visited. You always have to go back home and start from there again. I remember Steve Jobs proudly making a big point out of it. Theoretically, going back home and then to the last app takes only two steps, but problem is that when you have multiple pages of apps, it causes a bit of hesitation to locate an app. Both iOS's ""double-clicking Home"" and WP's ""long-pressing back button"" give you a nice quick list of the opened apps to simplify the selection of apps, but still the additional ""Back"" button functionality WP is very much appreciated. Another thing that impacts the efficiency is the management of installed apps. The iOS manages installed apps in a simplistic way with much emphasis on the appearance not the functionality. Windows Phone has a much more sophisticated way. The installed apps are directly and separately searchable, and are also automatically organized under alphabetical categories that can be quickly accessed through a single page grid (which itself is accessible by a single swipe). If you have less than 20 installed apps, you will see no difference. If you have about 20-50, the difference would start to show. With 50-100, it becomes apparent, and beyond 100, the difference would be huge. The more apps you install, the greater the difference would be. So power users will find this an advantage on Windows Phone. When you come to think of it, the above may be the reasons why the iOS is so intuitive for beginners, but less efficient for more experienced users. On user interfaces, these two things often conflict. I can see why many like the flow design of iOS, but I prefer WP8's flow much better. 14. CUSTOMIZATION It almost sounds silly that one of the biggest improvements WP8 has over WP7 is adding some smaller sized tiles. Hardly innovative, but it makes a big difference, largely speaking against the old design. I don't like those big tiles. I simply don't think any app deserves that much attention, especially in such a uniquely precious small room. I customized my start page to have all tiles in quarter size except for the phone button. Thank you, Microsoft, for allowing such basic freedom. My start space is now much more efficiently used and no longer a victim of the almost tyrant ""less is more"" so-called clean design philosophy. The level of customization further down is mostly on par with the iOS. Android would still have an edge over both, but I think this is got to a very reasonable level already. But I do have one big complaint against Windows Phone: With WP8, you still can't turn off that stupid screen auto-rotation. You simply can't so far. No user settings has that. No app that does that. Even unlocked phone can't do that. Forgive me to call auto-rotation feature stupid. But it is one of those tech-things that make no sense on a mobile phone, precisely because a mobile phone is just so, mobile. The problem is that these device designers fail to understand that the proper (or desired) orientation of the screen simply cannot be determined by an orientation sensor. The sensor determines the orientation using gravity and the earth as the reference, not your body. As a result, the sensor can only detect the phone's orientation itself, not its relative orientation to the user's body posture, which is what actually matters. So it works properly only when you are standing straight, not when you are inclined or lie down. In fact, it always turns to the wrong orientation when you are inclined or lie down, so you have to fight it. In practice, the non-switchable autorotation causes much more annoyance than any utility. It is OK if they just use it as a gimmick to attract feature counters, but it is not OK to have it permanently implemented and cannot be turned off. It's simply stupid. I think the best solution is iPad 3's combination of autorotation plus a hardware-based button for a mechanical lock. It combines the best of both worlds. The iPhone has autorotation plus user manual options in the settings and apps, which is not as good as the iPad, but still much better than Windows Phone's autorotation only, whenever and wherever. The reason why I make this auto-rotation issue such a big deal is just to make a point, not because the thing itself is so life-threatening. I can live with the annoyance. But the failure or overlook of such issues after all these years is very telling of Microsoft. 15. REFINEMENT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM When it comes to very fine details, Apple wins. WP8 has improved over WP7, but still no match to the iOS in its refinement of details. Company wise, and culture wise, Microsoft has not fully learned this art yet. Let me name a few: (1) The input mode is still a mess despite an excellent keyboard. Although typing new text is easy, accurately placing the cursor to edit text is virtually impossible. Also, you can't quickly do a ""select all"" to copy and paste a text. It requires a painful maneuver to do so, many times more difficult than doing the same on iOS which gives you a selection in an automatically pop-up menu. Oh please, they struggled with this copy and paste thing from the very beginning and received a disproportionately great amount of criticisms, so you would think that they would have jumped all over it to not only improve it, but in fact over-improve it. Not at all. It's still a half cooked solution. (2) The network status indicators on the top of the screen don't stay. They disappear transiently. You have to touch the screen in a particular manner to bring them back. You can't change that in the settings. This is useless frivolous design. The indicators don't occupy extra space at all when they are displayed, and their disappearance does not result in any benefit. It just makes the system fussy and less certain. My basic assertion is that cell phone's network status is a constant user concern, and being able to glance at these essential indicators any time gives you peace of mind, and is a good part of the harmonious ""handset environment"". Having to always struggle for such a simple thing is nonsense especially when the sacrifice is made for no purpose. I think what happened at Microsoft was like this: One day, someone from Microsoft management shouted in a meeting: ""Less is more! Less is more! Look at Apple, we need to learn from them!"" And shortly after that, a Microsoft engineer came up with this idea of hiding the network status indicators... Microsoft has done the hard part of building a very promising mobile OS, it shouldn't be so difficult for them to do these very basic and simple things right. It is obviously not an engineering issue. It is a product management issue.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

Every 3 decibels is twice the volume level, so the Lumia 920 records hi-def audio that is about 50 times louder than the competing phones are able to record.

1533,B00A2V7BA4,Techcheque,5,14-Nov-12,False,Simply the best,"I can honestly say no other phone reaches even near the quality, innovation level and design this phone has. The screen is just awesome with all the technological aspects such as super sensitivity (you can use the phone with fingernail, pen or even gloves on), sun light reading enhancements (clear black + auto brightness), high contrast, refresh rate, resolution, and ppi (which is even bigger than in Retina display). Everything just looks beautiful on this screen. With hardware enabled image stabilization the device takes amazing video (Full HD 30 fps!) like you were using a tripod while shooting in one hand! To make videos perfect, there are also 3(!) High Amplitude Audio Capture (HAAC) rich recording microphones, which allow capture sound up to 140DB. This means the sound does not distort when you record a video e.g. at concert or at nightclub. And the photos taken in low light just, phew.. blow your mind. What can I say, Lumia 920 makes point-and-shoot cameras useless - and in some cases even DSLRs. In the sound section, a surround boost is given to then videos and music. The latter one is by the way free via Nokia Music (on selected countries). Nokia has not saved its efforts or R&D budget in this area either; surround technology to the phone is brought to you by the one and only: Dolby. There is also an equalizer with almost 20 presets but you can create also your own if you wish. While some other rivals make the consumers use adapter when charging the phone with 3rd party peripherals, Nokia has enabled consumers to charge the phone wirelessly, and this works even on induction stove (do not try that one at home though). While you put the phone on charger, you can set a default app to run (this is enabled by NFC), e.g. Outlook when you charge it at work, and Nokia Music when you charge it on top off JBL speaker at home. The black matte unibody polycarbonate shell with scratch resistant ceramic zirconium buttons and back plate, scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 2 and sculpted 2.5D glass gives the device an elegant and stylish look. These material combined with highlevel buildquality makes the Lumia 920 almost impossible to break by accident. The design is based on Lumia 900, which won International Design Excellence Award on July 2012. Somehow Nokia managed to make this device to look even better - No wonder Helsinki is the World Design Capital 2012. Nokia City Lens with augmented reality is awesome when traveling, but it gives an opportunity to get you to the places you didn't know even existed in your own hometown. With offline voice assisted turn-by-turn navigation you can easily find your way to destination. You can download the maps of whole country at once, which of course saves money, since there is no need to use the data-connection (especially abroad). Maps are a bit better quality than with some rival companies, since Nokia Maps (=""Here""-maps) are used by Garmin, BMW, Mercedes, Ford, Facebook, and even this place where you are reading the review, Amazon.com. There are also public transport schedules with maps, so this device simply makes your life so much easier. I don't know anything particular what to tell about WP8, but the usability and design is on a very high level. Also the live tiles are awesome. You can choose 3 different sizes and depending on the size, the apps behind them will bring more detailed information. Also, you can create default settings to some app (such as set default destination in public transport schedules), and pin it as shortcut to the main menu (this means, that with only with a one click from home screen, you can see the transport schedules to your destination). It has the best social media features, you don't even have to open facebook app to know if someone has written to you. Also, if you own XBox, you can watch the video or browse the web with your phone and watch it same time from your TV via Smartglass app. For enterprise users the OS offers the highest security level possible (well, not counting RIM here). The device has features like bitlocker, secure-boot, security policy enforcement, remote locking, remote wipe, and lost device tracking. Via company hub, enterprises can publish internal apps not found on public marketplace. There's also Office 365 included so all the SharePoint lovers out there will also love this phone. With O365 & Information Rights Management, you can e.g. track, audit, and prevent users from reading, forwarding, printing, faxing or pasting confidential documents for unauthorized use. However, Lumia 920 has one downside to it: It's heavy. Just kidding, even baby can lift it and put it to mouth. There's nothing which I could possibly complain at the moment.

1707,B00A2V7BA4,Guy Hoang,5,14-Nov-12,False,Amazing smartphone for a great price,"The Nokia Lumia 920 is Nokia's flagship phone for 2012. What this means is that Nokia has packed all the latest technology into this phone. It comes with Windows Phone 8, which just came out in October 2012. The older Windows phones will not get the new operating system, so it's a better idea to pick up a Windows Phone 8 device versus a cheaper Windows Phone 7.5. This will ensure that you will receive all the future updates. Although Windows Phone 8 looks just like the previous version, it was actually rewritten from the ground up to include a new kernel. What does this mean? It means that the new phones can now use faster processors, have High Definition screens, and goodies like NFC and SD Card support. (note that the Lumia 920 doesn't have an SD slot) Thanks for Windows Phone 8, Nokia has been able to include the latest tech into its 920. This includes a fast dual core processor, 1GB of ram, an excellent HD display, and the PureView camera. This makes for a very smooth experience. This phone is blazing fast! It is just as fast as the competition like the iPhone 5 & the Galaxy S3. The Windows Phone OS is very easy to use, yet it's powerful. Twitter and Facebook are baked into the OS, so you can access the feed and timeline straight from your phone. The app selection isn't as good as android or iOS, but it's getting new apps every day. On my phone I already have Kindle, Audible, Amazon, Chase, CNN, Flixter, Facebook, Twitter, Garmin, IMDb, Youtube, Netflix, PayPal, Skype, Urbanspoon, WSJ & Yelp. This is more than enough for me! Game selection is good too, with the Xbox Live integration. Angry Birds Star Wars came out the same day as the android and iOS version, which is a great sign. The camera is also a big selling point. It has OIS, which is optical image stabilization. Since most smartphones have really tiny image sensors, the only way to capture more light is to have the camera shutter open longer. However, since our hand shake just a tiny bit, this usually results in blurry pictures. The camera on the 920 can fight camera shake with OIS. This will result in great pictures even at night. It really is amazing technology. I have added camera samples to the product page so you can judge for yourself. There has been criticism that the daytime pictures are not as sharp as the competition. Nokia has stated that they will release a software update very soon to fix this issue. I will report back when it comes out. To sum it up, for the price asked this phone is a tremendous value. It has 32GB of storage, a great camera, a fast processor and the latest operating system. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone.",12.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1726,B00A2V7BA4,Wayne Schulz,4,14-Nov-12,False,Phone is solid - the OS needs to catch up to competitors,"I current use an iPhone 5 and upgraded my Galaxy Nexus to this Nokia 920. The phone is solid and while it's heavier than other similar smartphones - they weight has not been an issue and I don't notice it in day to day use. Most of the issue with the phone seems to be around the Windows Phone 8 operating system. Bluetooth is somewhat problematic in that if you're paired listening to music or podcasts and receive an incoming SMS the phone announces it and then often drops the connection. When you try to restart the song the connection is completely silent unless you switch to another song then back. I find the call quality to be good. Some have noted that the ear volume is not very high. I've not been in a noisy environment where I can test it fully but so far no problems. Camera seems very good. I would not buy this phone solely for the camera though as it's not significantly better than most other top smartphones like iPhone 5 or Samsung. Battery life seems a little short and I've read quite a few reports that are all over the place ranging from ""I only get a few hours of battery "" to ""I have 20% battery left at midnight when I go to bed"". I'm not sure what to make of this but perhaps some is due to whether people are connecting email that is constantly polling versus setting accounts to retrieve mail hourly or every two hours. Other battery issues could be due to apps that are running amok. Overall I'm pleased with this phone.

1440,B00A2V7BA4,Haidong,5,14-Nov-12,False,Drop dead gorgeous,"Lumia 920 review after first day of use. Galaxy S3 has a cheap plastic body, and it does not survive road pavement drop test in a Youtube video. Its screen is all shattered. The Lumia 920 survives 3 drops. Yes, the Lumia is heavier, but it has a substantial rock solid feel to it. I got the glossy white Lumia 920. The curved glass with shiny white body is drop dead gorgeous. Every one I show the phone to says it is beautiful. The white one has a European modern lounge feel to it, it looks very nice. The 920 is the same thickness as my old Samsung Focus. It is more pocketable than I thought. It has a much better dimension compare to the 900. The glossy body makes it kind of slippery. I will get a clear case on Amazon later. The screen is gorgeous. It is an IPS panel that shows it color really well, even under the Texas sun at noon time. The resolution is higher density than the iPhone. I cannot see the pixels. Everything is smooth on the screen. It is the only capacitive screen that works when you wear a glove. It is amazing this IPS panel color pops as much as a Samsung super AMOLED screen. The camera is amazing. I will post more samples later. At low light condition its picture is brighter than what the human eye can see. It is the best camera in phones, hands down. I expect the image processing logic will be updated later, because I find the photo is softer than I expect, and Engadget Mariam says she has seen a sharper image processing in a pre-production unit. WP8 runs much faster and snappier than WP7. There are a lot of improvements. The kids corner will be the best feature. There is batch delete in photos now. The AT&T version of the Lumia 920 has traditional Chinese display language as an option, but I have not found a way to install simplified Chinese display language yet. It is just a matter of time some one will figure out how to side load language pack to it. The input language includes simplified and traditional Chinese, including hand writing. The TellMe feature now support multiple languages, such as Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland China Mandarin, and Hong Kong Cantonese. When you drive and get an IM or text, you can ask it to read it for you. Nokia adds some very good apps to the platform, including downloadable offline map and navigation. It also has some cool camera apps. The most interesting one is Cinemagraph. I think the Nokia Music is only for US English songs. It does not have Chinese songs yet. I am very very happy with Nokia fixing most problems in the 900, and makes the 920 a phone that I really love.",16.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

1515,B00A2V7BA4,Aaron,5,14-Nov-12,False,Lumia 920 is an amazing device - Updated,"I love the Windows Phone 8 interface, but I'll try to keep the review focused on this hardware. Simply put, this phone is amazing. You get the high end specs of Android phones, with a style that I think beats even the iPhone. Instead of enumerating all of the technologies in the phone, I'll just try to give some personal anecdotes. Space: I didn't think the 32GB of space would matter to me since I could easily live with 8GB phones before, but now that WP8 devices can be recognized as USB storage, it has become incredibly useful since I frequently forget my flash drives. Also, you will want an extra few GB's to download maps for offline use, which is a killer feature. I use their offline maps all the time. They are accurate, offer points of interest, and don't waste my paltry data plan. Also they integrate with Nokia Drive to give you the best navigation of any smartphone. Camera: I'm not a camera buff, I just want something that can take a few snapshots. That said, the camera on this phone is amazing, especially in low light situations. I took a panorama shot of the Seattle city scape right after sunset and it looked amazing. This camera is so good that it almost makes me want to become a photographer. With the option to auto-upload full res photos to Skydrive (thankfully only over WiFi, again my data plan is SMALL), I never have to worry about loosing my photos if I loose my phone. Style: Not to sound vain or shallow, but several people have actually commented on my phones looks. I wasn't even trying to show it in this cases, I was just checking my text messages. If that is important to you, then you can't get a more attractive device than the 920. The curved glass is a huge improvement over the 900, and sometimes I just like to touch it. I was worried about the weight of the phone, but honestly it feels fine in my hand and pocket. In fact, compared to my lighter weight plastic Focus, it feels substantial and premium. Cons: My one complaint is that WiFi automatically turns off when your not using the phone. This is a WP ""feature"" that I hope MS changes in a future update. I would have more to say, but I have only had the device for a week. I'm sure when winter comes, I'll appreciate the screen that can be used with gloves on. I'm sure I'll also love the wireless charging pads, but I have to wait since my wife needed something to get me for Christmas. If you already know you want WP8, then I think this is clearly the best deal at $100. That incredibly low price must be how AT&T scored an exclusive deal. If you are not sure about WP8, then please check it out in person. The start screen has been drastically improved by the ability to resize live tiles. And the app marketplace is getting better, fast. In fact, we actually got Angry Birds Star Wars on the same day as iPhone. You can probably chalk that up to the inclusion of native code. Updated - 12/5/2012: Since I don't want to be a blind fanboy, I have to deduct a star for some lingering annoyances that I have noticed. I'll write them in the order that they annoy me the most. 1) Half of my text messages do not get sent the first time and I have to click to resend them, sometimes twice. I cannot tell you if this is the device or the network's fault. I got my 920 from Build so it may not be configured correctly for AT&T. But none the less, this is an incredibly annoying issue. 2) Crashes / Freezes. An app I bought when I had WP7.5, Risk, crashes every time I try to launch it. Furthermore, another app, Texas Hold Em, actually crashes my entire phone. Perhaps you can blame this on the developers, but the fact remains that this never happened under WP7/7.5. Also the phone has seemed to freeze a few times for unknown reasons. This happened once or twice with my Focus and Lumia 900, but I think it feel a bit more frequent with my 920. 3) Possible power drain. When I first saw reports of this, I figured it must be isolated cases because I hadn't notice it. But now there have been at least two incidents where I feel I have noticed a rapid drain of power for unknown reasons. In fact, I missed my alarm this morning because my phone had died and I don't remember ever even seeing the ""low battery"" warning last night. So far its rare, and perhaps this is all in my head, but I never ran out of juice like this on my WP7 devices. In conclusion, I still love my 920 and wouldn't trade it for any other phone. Perhaps this is just testament to how solid and bug free WP7/7.5 was, but WP8 feels a little bit buggy to me, at least in comparison to WP7. I expect this is due to the new WinRT kernel and I have hopes that MS pushes out updates quickly to resolve these issues. When these issues are resolved, I will gladly update my review back to 5 stars. Updated - 4/10/2013: I figured I would come back and update my review to address the issues I mentioned in the last update. In summary, they are all mostly gone. I'm very glad that text messages are now sent reliably. And I can't remember the last time an app crashed my phone or I had a seemingly rapid power drain like I experienced before. So I'm bumping this back up to 5 stars. This phone has been phenomenal. My wife recently got one as well. Its a little big for her, but she is adjusting to it. She likes the new Pandora app which is commercial free for one year. If I had to make one complaint, it would be size. The phone is certainly big and if Nokia can shave off 30-50 grams in future versions, that would help a lot.",36.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

15528,B075FLG6MV,Amazon Customer,4,14-Mar-18,True,she is in love with this phone,"I ordered this phone for my little sister as a gift for her birthday. She is becoming of age and felt it was time to be able to have a personal way to communicate with the family. Although she is surrounded by iPhones and Samsung devices, she is in love with this phone! The phone arrived in a nice small box. The box contains a charging block, micro USB, and even a pair of headphones with a mic! Even though the phone has a nice sturdy premium feel to it, it does have its ups and downs. Pros- The phone feels nice in the hands. Apparently, it weighs about 161 grams. It also has a 5in display with gorilla glass 3 that I think goes up to 720p resolution, Which is not bad considering this phone cost sub 100$. Another great thing is that this phone is receiving all of the latest software updates and security patches. It is going to be supported for at least 2 years so you cant go wrong with that. The phone has all necessary bands for the use in the USA and also contains all wifi bands. The last pro that I can remember is the HUGE battery it has at 4100 mAh. This thing can last you about 2 days. Cons- A big let down is the Snapdragon 212 they have this thing running on. If you are a speed user ( I have a Pixel and a Galaxy S7) then don't consider this phone as a daily driver. Instead, it is the type of phone you take with you on your travels or as a backup. But in my case, My sister is patient and understands that her first car isn't going to be a Ferrari. It is perfect for calls and texts, surfs things on google with ease and can handle a game or two but don't plan on having things running in the back too long since it only has 1gb of RAM. The camera on this phone is also just ok but also again for my situation it is perfect. She isn't going to be posting on social media or taking pics of the grand canyon. Instead, she'll use it to take pics of the cats and dogs etc. The storage is also pretty small at 8gb but can be expanded since it has an sd card slot. So to recap, This phone is great for 100$. Do get it if you're going to gift it to your grandma, mom, sister or anybody who has never had a smartphone before. Also if you need a backup or travel phone this phone is great for that too. Do not get this if you're used to the speed of the newer flagships as you'll find yourself getting upset over the small lag that seems to be an eternity.

Nokia won't even finish the race to begin with.,"I'll preface this by saying if you have no issues, this product is amazing. I truly loved this phone. But the customer service is AWFUL. 3 months after paying almost $400 for it, the battery swelled, causing the back to unadhere and expand. I was told it would be fixed under warranty if I sent it in, but received it back unrepaired with the claim that it was actually not under warranty. Not only that, but now my phone didn't charge at all, which wasn't a problem before I sent it in. Nokia has refused to do absolutely anything about it, even though it was a problem with *their* battery after only **3 months.** Bottom line: I will NEVER buy another Nokia phone again, simply because I do not feel supported by this company in the slightest.

Thankfully I got the phone during a Black Friday sale so it wasn't a huge financial loss (about $60 between the phone, cover and screen protector) and it's just a short-term solution so all that really matters is that it makes and receives phone calls, but I definitely would NOT recommend this to someone who is not tech-savvy or patient.

It offers a lot that the newer iphones are now offering. The pictures I was well pleased with. Though it does not have a front camera. It though takes pretty good pictures. I would not go to the place of amazing - good pictures. You have to press the button on the screen in order to take pictures which can be a burden at times. Wi fi phone calls can be hard to hear - it though is a nice option if you have bad service. The battery life though requires you to plug in every night or you will be low battery life.

26681,B07XVZXR5Y,TwoMetreBill,3,14-Dec-19,True,"Terrible, non-standard, USB-C port","I should have believed the reviewers about the poor quality USB-C port on the Nokia 7.1, they are using the same ""totally junk"" port on the 7.2. I have several USB-C memory sticks and cables which work just fine with my LG & Samsung devices but don't work at all with the Nokia. Nokia should sue their supplier. For the rest of the phone: I'm replacing a LG G7 ThinQ which was twice as expensive because I wore out the battery. So I do not expect a phone with the same overall quality and am judging it accordingly. Android One is a nice variation from vendor modified versions of Android BUT they should have included (at least a link) to a basic set of instructions for this OS. It was more difficult to get started than either LG or Samsung (I have a Samsung tablet) but once operating, it is more pleasant to use. Nice to have all the standard Android apps available, LG even blocked the standard Google file manager. I hope to never go back to a vendor version of the OS again. It would be nice if Android One didn't waste the top 20% of the display for the data and time, would be like to have that for apps. I did a full backup to the Google Cloud before switching and everything (including data for all but one application) was restored. (My wife just upgraded her iPhone, she is jealous because Apple does a poor job with non-Apple applications). But what to expect compared to my LG: 1. WiFi tests slower with Fast.com but downloads run much faster. No explanation, the difference is huge. 2. Cannot transfer files with Windows 10. Win 10 sees the device but not the internal nor the SD card storage. I need to figure out how to transfer files wirelessly (very clumsy) because it is unlikely that Google is going to fix this problem. Was not an issue with the LG or Samsung devices. 3. Charging is must faster with my Anker chargers than the reviewers on technical review sites experienced. I've not used the supplied Nokia charger. Went from 18% to 100% in 1hr 43min. Not as fast as my LG but then that is probably why the LG battery wore out in just 16 months. 4.

1658,B00A2V7BA4,Jose,5,14-Dec-12,False,Amazing Nokia Lumia 920,"I upgraded from a Black Nokia Lumia 900 to the Red Lumia 920. I knew that the limitations of the camera, resolution display, HD video on my Lumia 900 were due to WP7.5. Those limitations are gone with WP8 and Nokia beautifully takes advantage of the new OS. The pictures and video are cystal clear, with natural colors and lighting. The larger 4.5 screen makes it easier for reading and surfing the internet. The screen is so clear with sharp display of words and pictures, the smooth gorilla glass top is virtually smudge resistant. This is a feature I truly appreciate compare to other phones I have used including the Lumia 900. The solid build quality of the Lumia 920 makes it unbreakable when falling from your hand on to a cement sidewalk, some of you may have seen the you tube video of the Nokia Lumia used to hammer a nail into a piece of wood, this is truly a durable phone. Critics will say the Lumia 920 is heavy, but fail to elaborate as to why Lumia 920 is heavy and the benefits. Well, it is heavier than other phones and here are the benefits, includes a larger battery that last 3 hours longer than other phones, solidly built so that you do not need to buy an armored cover to protect fragile phones, no need to carry an extra battery or charger. Other phones come in only Black or Grey, because they are covered by their owners to protect their fragile phones, this renders the benefits of lightness and thinness of other phones over Lumia 920 to meaningless. The beautifully designed red Lumia does not need to be covered and I am so grateful, because I get a lot of remarks on the color and questions as to who makes my phone. The Lumia 920 will certainly attract attention. There are so many wonderful feature on the Nokia Lumia 920 with WP8 that I could write a small book. I recommend you get your hands on a Nokia Lumia 920 to see for yourself what a great phone this is. You can then come to Amazon.com and order it.

Nokia repair kept the phone for a month, while refusing to tell me what the status was. They eventually told me at the beginning of August that they were refusing to repair the phone because of ""water damage"" - even though my phone has never been wet.

They placed the water detection sticker directly inside the charging port so that even the smallest amount of moisture from condensation or humidity would turn it red, and they could refuse to repair the phone.

14084,B071ZDQ6MV,Molly,1,14-Aug-17,True,It's a low budget phone with low budget features.,"Edit** Now that I've had it for 6 months, I can officially say I don't like the phone and can't wait until I can get a new one. There are very few options anywhere for screen protectors that work (even just adhering properly would be a big help) and the screen is extremely fragile. The speaker phone issue has become unbearable as I'm on the road a lot of work and need to make hands free calls and it has not fixed. The camera is really bad. The issue of the phone screen going black and making it unable to hang up or move out of the call to do something else keeps coming back, alternated by a screen so sensitive I'm muting and dialing mid call unknowingly. It has been a good enough patch for now because apparently you need to sell a kidney to afford a new phone these days, but I'm so sick of this phone's cheap qualities at this point that enough is enough. Old review** For the price, the phone works great. Some issues I've had: Screen going black during call and unable to access phone to put on speaker, hang up, do other things. Sometimes the bottom left button won't work to close out your applications, or gives you an error message saying ""split screen not compatible with this app"" so I have to open Chrome, then hit it, then close out of everything. Camera isn't great, and for some reason it's raised away from the back of the phone, making it prone to scratches when set down. Speaker phone volume is extremely low, making it pointless. Screen cracked after one drop, was waiting for my screen protector and case to arrive in the mail. It's a small one so not too terrible. Things I like: The price, no mandatory apps like other phones, does your basic phone things. If you need a budget phone, this will work well. Keep in mind the screen is curved when you are buying screen protectors. I hope they work out the kinks soon.",6.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

So far I am very happy with the quality of the device, I only have a few issues. Pros: Excellent Build Quality, It feels like it is built better than some high end phones I have seen. Stock Android, there is almost no bloatware on this phone, with the exception of a Nokia Service app and some ringtones. Fingerprint sensor, the sensor is a bit difficult to set up, but after you set it up correctly it is very accurate Screen, though it is only 1080p the screen is very crisp and has excellent colors. Micro SD card slot Performance, the phone doesn't have a very good processor, but it doesn't seem to suffer at all for it, Games run very well, and I rarely ever see slowdown Speakers, I don't use the speaker that much, I'm more into headphones myself, but the speaker is very good, don't expect it to work miracles, but it sounds just as good as a halfway decent external speaker would Cons: Camera, the back camera is around a 7/10, be aware that the camera is only 16 MP if you take images in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Front is borderline bad, the image itself isn't terrible, but if there is any excess light it just completely blinds the camera Partial AT&T support, AT&T is the only service provider that works in my area, so it is upsetting to only get partial support Power button placement, this isn't a big deal but the power button is very close to the volume buttons.

Been very happy with Amazon's service when I needed an exchange. There was an initial smudge on the screen and my order was promptly replaced with no questions asked. This second one is looking very good. Product: - Well designed and constructed. My HTC Thunderbolt had issues that I don't see here. - One of the best things I can say is that this phone is fast. Loading apps, switching, closing, playing is all snappy and fluid. I trust it will hold up with future OS updates. - It's a bit of a heavy phone if you're going to compare it to the iPhone, though much larger. I likely the matte finish of the black over the glossy finish of the white. It fits in a pocket well. The main issue I have with this is that when it's sitting flat on the back the Carl Zeiss shiny area rests a bit higher than the rest of the phone. - Wireless charging is a huge plus. I rather enjoy not having to plug this thing in when I get home. - The screen is fantastic. Nokia's PureBlack tech is good to have and it has some vibrant colors. - Camera is also great. This takes amazing low-light photos. I was recently out at a party after sunset and was able to take portraits with little flash needed (if any). Nokia has some good apps to help take advantage of this capability. - It's mostly rectangular with slightly curved edges but has a slightly curved back to help the stereo speaker, which sounds great. OS I do like Windows Phone and I think the platform has something going for it. It integrates well with my Surface and xBox. So you can clearly see I'm in the platform deep. Good SkyDrive compatibility and I can edit Word docs with no problem. Sure there are some apps to be desired but that's mostly items I check every now and then. Development is good from Nokia and independent developers (i.e., Using ""Instance"" as an Instagram app and 6sec as a Vine app). Some features Microsoft really needs to communicate better about. For instance, using the people hub to connect to multiple social networks is really great. The photos hub can filter out all these social interactions for just photo-related posts from my contacts. The gaming hub notifies me when my xBox friends come online and want to play a specific game.

This phone is a bit thicker and weighs a bit more than alot of the competitors, but I like it. It feels very solid and well made.

You can also choose themes and colors. On the iphone and android smartphones you are stuck with the same old icons lined up on your screen. The UI on the windows 8 phones is also so much slicker than android and ios. Screens don't just slide up/down, left/right...they slam up against the screen in various ways. The start screen seems to slam into the gorilla glass from far away on the left, kinda swooping up on the glass...you have to see it to appreciate it. I love the entire ui because it's so different, yet so intuitive and appealing. People who say they don't like windows phones probably have not spent very much time with one. Trust me, the Lumia 920 and windows 8 phone are fantastic.

13960,B071ZDQ6MV,Paul J. Fortunato,5,13-Sep-17,True,Premium Build Quality and Solid Performance for a budget price,"I have been watching this phone's development for awhile now, as I am a happy previous Nokia phone user. Every Nokia I've owned has taken my abuse and continued to work flawlessly. Obviously smartphones are different, but I had hoped that some of that resilience could rub off on Nokia's new foray into Android smartphones. The build quality: This phone is machined and built to a much higher standard than any sub $400 phone on the market. It is solid, and feels great in hand, that is of course until I put a case on it. But its initial build quality does give me some confidence that it will handle day to day abuse without much issue. Performance: I was a bit worried by the processor in this phone and had wished Nokia went with the Snapdragon 625 like their competitor, Motorola. Of course, the Moto 5g also didn't have 4GB of RAM, so it too was a tradeoff. So far though, after having installed my apps and put the phone under my own typical multitasking load, I am impressed by its overall responsiveness. It is not a speed demon by any means, but it doesn't hang or lag in any way that is frustrating. I can seamlessly go from streaming a podcast to surfing the web, watching netflix, mapmyrun, to using Google maps without a single hiccup. Fellow Android users, I'm sure you know when its time for you to reboot your phone because it starts to get laggy: I haven't had to reboot the phone since I got it. I'm not a super power user, but I do multitask on my phone, I just don't run power intensive games--would rather game on my PC or PS4. I think the fact that the phone runs stock Android also plays to the phones' relatively modest processor. Battery life seems to be very good on this phone. I can get 2 full days of usage if I'm a bit lean on using the screen. Can always get well over a full day with it even if my face is glued to it. Camera: Its fine for what it is. I use it mostly as a scanner for documents, or for random documentary shots. It is responsive and the image quality is OK. I personally don't really care, as I carry a dedicated camera with me that is significantly better than any smartphone could ever be. Overall, I think Nokia has a solid hit on their hands. The phone does everything I need it to do without frustrating me with heavy lag or glitches. And it does all this in an attractively designed body and a dirt cheap price tag.",74.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

15482,B075FLG6MV,Dave Tyler,5,13-Oct-18,True,The Nokia 2 is an amazing value for the right application,"SUMMARY: This is a amazing phone for the money, but only if you don't need many apps or require high performance. According to the reviews here everyone either loves or hates this phone, which made it difficult for me to decide if it was right for me. It turns out to be perfect but I'm using it as a 2nd phone for travel; it would NOT work as my primary phone. The difficulty with this phone is insufficient memory and storage space, as others have pointed out. Today it was running slowly and I tried to send a picture via MMS and it failed. Turns out I'm running out of storage already. I was able to uninstall some apps and move others to the SD card to get it working well again, but I still have less than 1GB to spare. Everything else about this phone is better than I expected for what I paid ($100) and it's so nice to never have to worry about the battery dying! This review is for the TA-1035-B. I notice earlier versions are selling for even cheaper but I can't vouch for those. BTW if you have a little extra to spend, my primary phone is a Moto G5 Plus which I found for only $150 and is a nice upgrade in every way from my previous phone which cost almost $1000!

1634,B00A2V7BA4,GeekGal,4,13-Oct-12,True,"Wonderful phone, but if you've been a symbian user be ready to wrestle with it ...","Let me start by saying, I have been using Nokia Symbian-based phones since they first came on the market, and I was very upset when Nokia dropped Symbian OS for Windows when it offered the Lumia line - WHY, Nokia, WHY???? Melodrama aside, even though I was unhappy, I wasn't ready to move to another brand, so grumbling and snarling, I decided to take the plunge and buy a Nokia Lumia 900 when my old E71x started gasping. I'm reviewing the Lumia after having had it for only 48 hours: I got it one evening and almost sent it back the next morning - I was that frustrated - but it has so much potential that I couldn't do it. To some degree I have mixed feelings: it has some cons that try their best to offset its many, many pros, so I've given it a rating of 4 stars. -- Pros: I've found that, overall this is a really sweet phone, in spite of its operating system. I say that last, because I have had serious issues migrating from the old Nokia (like, you CAN'T. NOT.AT.ALL.NEVER.). Ah, for the days when one could back up the old Nokia phone and restore to the new one ... If you're used to Windows Mobile or Blackberry OS you'll love this phone out of the box, although it involves a learning curve no matter what. It beats out the iPhone with no problem, in my opinion: it offers a lot more for a lot less money. I had an iPhone for a while, and was, shall we say, 'underwhelmed'. That's not the case for this phone, it can do anything an iPhone can do, and more; and I think it does it much, much better, more reliably. It has some heft - its neither light nor tiny - but it has a metal chassis. Otherwise, it's smooth, sleek, feels good in you hands, and the touch functions have to be experienced to be believed. It is really simple to operate, too. The Lumia 900 has three buttons on the right - okay, four: the volume keys, the on/off button in the middle, and the camera key near the bottom. The home icon also acts as 'back' and 'close'. Get into something you don't like? Hit the Windows 'home' icon. Locking and unlocking the phone originates with the on/off button, and a sliding screen. The high resolution screen produces colors and objects that pop - they are just that crisp and bright. 'Zoom up/Zoom down' are performed using two fingers on the touch screen, and you can view your screen in landscape or portrait orientation. To silence a call, just flip the screen over - flip silence, I think it's called. It has high-end camera optics, and Nokia provides a free app that gives you the ability to take panorama and NICE zoom shots - the camera is almost SLR quality. Nokia provides a free navigational app that's been available on all of its phones the last few years: anywhere you want to go, they can get you there. Mapquest is available as a paid app, and google maps is accessible from the web. My phone can talk to my car (go figure?), so I'm loving Nokia Maps. I need it, because I get lost, a lot. Call quality is consistently clear, sound is free of noise. I don't drop calls, and I live on the Texas coast where cell signal is sometimes non-existent. I wish the volume of the music player was a bit better for use without headphones or speakers, that's the only complaint I have about that. That all said, here are some of the cons: I am not one of those folks puts contacts, etc. online, syncs everything with Outlook, Google, Facebook, and the like, so it was very difficult to even move my contacts. I was able to move them using bluetooth, finally, but even that was a pain. You must download an app to do it, because the lumia won't talk to its Symbian relatives through bluetooth (or anything else) at all without the app. Unfortunately, the app is designed to only move contacts and there are no others. In my experience, this is the first time I've run into a phone that a Symbian OS phone can't communicate with, and that it's from the same manufacturer, is a real shame. I did try to pair them; the Symbian phone thought it was paired, but the Lumia paired, then responded, 'not supported', and closed the connection. A family member has a newer Symbian OS phone than mine, and the Lumia won't talk to that one by bluetooth either. As if this wasn't enough, I found moving my library of .mobi, Kindle, Audible, PDF, Office, and other documents was not fun - I'm still doing it, in fact. That exercise has involved 2- and 3-stage transfers. I've been bluetoothing from the old phone to my PC, then from my PC to my Lumia, then moving them around to where I'd like to have them rather than where Windows wants them. And forget about migrating EMAILS, text and mms - the support pages tell you to back it all up on your PC and use the 'appropriate software' to work with them on it. They will never exist on your phone again, gentle Symbian user. I couldn't send texts or messages either for a couple of days: this phone does not have the AT&T internet settings in it. Normally that isn't a problem: lots of phones ship without the AT&T access point name (APN) settings, but send text and picture messages with no problems. The Lumia is not one of them, unfortunately. We (AT&T & I) have gotten it to work, so that's fine now. So, if you get it and need the APN settings, call AT&T or search 'AT&T APN settings'. In conclusion, even with the frustrations, I can still say the Nokia Lumia 900 packs a lot of punch for the price. I liked Symbian OS so much that I was sorry to make the switch, but this is a REALLY REALLY NICE consolation prize.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

14163,B071ZDQ6MV,madclown,4,13-Nov-17,True,4.5 stars,"ch 1 introduction - the backstory i bought this phone back in august 2017 sometime thereabouts. my existing ""blu"" died suddenly, and was looking for a phone to carry me over until feb next year when the new gen of Nokia was supposed to be launched (or so i thought) and then i searched to confirm my feb 2018 notion.. and i was enlightened Ch 2 - Preconceived Notions NOKIA!! i'm a bonafide nokia whore, built to last.. that's what i'm talking about... i had my mind set on getting a nokia as soon as they were re-launched... was always my plan. so there will be some bias to this review. SOME... i had a 2690 until the battery life became <1hr, which was after 6 years ( still have it with my contacts) replaced it with a 220 or something (rubbish). had to get this blu thing which my then gf got for me. .. lasted about 15 months. questions i had: 1) it calls itself a nokia... but then so did the lumia thing 2) can it work in my area? ch 3 - Answers i am proud to declare myself as the first person in Trinidad and Tobago to own a new nokia. what really sold me was in the questions, the seller SPECIFICALLY says ""caribbean"" (july 14 2017)... a seller that cares about me.. all the way out here in the caribbean... nice marketing ploy. it works (on Bmobile) - but note a nanosim will be needed, so be prepared to get that stuff sorted out at TSTT. so question 2- answered .. why do i review it now?? because i was waiting for the right moment, which was earlier this week.. when it slipped out my pocket.. and fell tumbling down about 13 HARD terrazo steps (a height of approx 3-4 metres), it didn't just land, i'm telling you.. it flipped, it pitched, it tumbled, it hit the step again and spiralled all the way down , eventually landing on its face in the corner of the staircase.. outside.. i was about to freak out but .. finally! a fall... if a nokia can't take a fall.. it doesn't deserve to even be in the same sentence with the word nokia... ... this phone survived... what's more... i picked it up... and continued to play my game on it (which is what i was reaching it to do) so.... i love it... from an old school nokia whore.. it performs as i would expect... and this was enough for me. it loses 0.5 star.. because i will never give something a full 5... not unless it is really really REALLY REALLY splendid... ch 4 - other nitty gritty for people actually caring for a ""review"" 1) its operation is... i guess par. that aforementioned blu was my first smartphone, i deliberately go against the grain, which ""smartphone"" is a part of- my experience on smartphones and their capabilities is limited so i don't know what the other products out there offer. 2) this does play pokemon go however, i couldn't with the blu (? due to lousy specs) .. i'm a year late but .. yay for me.. screw the haters. (i guess this reveals as well that the bar might be a bit low) 3) the camera is awesome tho... quite sublime quality imho 4) i bought with the phone the screen protector- which has cracked, but still works. i want to mention that the other day i lifted it out , and the actual screen of the phone is flawless still, i've never had a phone... this long... with a scratchless screen. basically, when i change the protector... this phone will look like new. 5) the weight is light (compared to my friend's phones at least.. in my opinion 6) battery life is good, takes about 4 hrs to charge , which can last a little over a day i estimate (if i don't play pokemon) ch 5 - reservations only a few. a) i personally would have found this phone easier to operate, had it had the traditional nokia menus... you know... where settings had date/time settings, call settings, phone settings etc ... that menu that all nokia whores would know.. its a little tricky finding what i need to, but i understand that they have to be a little modern to remain relevant b) connecting to my pc was a little challenging, not quite 'plug-and-play' - but then i think that solved itself (kind of) - i still have an issue with accessing my memory card and putting things on it, when i plug it in all i see is the 32G built in memory and not my card. but i haven't committed any effort into figuring this out, so i'll only mention it out of consideration for others. i'm sure nokia can just design an OVI Suite and that'll solve everything.. though personally.. i hated the OVI suite the 2690 used c) i don't have whatsapp (against my grain) i text. i hate that i can only select 1 text message at a time, i'f i have to forward 3 messages to a colleague, i have to select them individually and send, rather than just send all at once... or delete an entire conversation thread, as opposed to just deleting certain redundant parts of a conversation thread. but whatever. its annoying, but doesn't change the fact that i exhale more carbon dioxide than i inhale when i respire. summary: worthy of the name nokia.",2.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0
4922,B00O15MWOM,Mike,2,13-Nov-15,False,A cheap Android phone is far superior.,"I have to hand it to Nokia. For the price, it's quite sturdy. I've dropped this phone more times than I can count, but it still works just as well as the day I bought minus a couple of dings and scratches. Windows is a very responsive operating system, which makes the phone easy to use. On to the reason I gave it 2 stars. The main reason is apps. Microsoft likes to boast that they have 200k apps. That's nice, but they all suck! Developing for Windows seems to be an afterthought. Native apps really don't exist. Most are just launchers (YOUTUBE!) that take you to a painfully slow mobile website. If there are native apps, they're buggy. ESPN and Fox Sports basically stopped working, so I had to download CBS Sports. Fox News only works about 60% of the time. Games? Forget it! Even older games like Subway Surfer are sluggish. Another problem is Internet Explorer. Ugh! I can usually get about 10 minutes before it comes across a website it doesn't like and it crashes. Often, my whole screen will suddenly go blank, and the phone restarts. That normally wouldn't be such an issue for me except that there are no other good browsers in the app store because the app store SUCKS! There is no way to stream a purchased a movie on the phone, including their own video streaming service. Xbox Video used to be Zune! It had the ability to purchase/stream movies before! All Smartglass can do is turn a phone into a fancy Xbox remote control...oh yeah, the screen sometimes gives movie info too.

1426,B00A2V7BA4,Michael Anthony To,4,13-Nov-12,False,A true contender that rivals the iPhone 5.,"I've own the Samsung Focus, The Focus S, The Lumia 900 and this beauty. No doubt this is by far the best of the bunch. Windows Phone 8 has definitely improved over it's previous predecessor. The OS is very fluent, smooth and above all fast! Ive owned the iPhone 2G, 3G, 3Gs and 4 and tested the 5. I'll admit Apple has produce very great hardware, some of the finest out there and nothing can compare... Until now. Apple iOS... is starting become a bit dated. The reason, it has static icons, doesn't provide much detail or information. With Windows phone, it offers live tiles, allows me to see what I need without the need of going into the app. Live updates definitely is a time saver. Another example why I prefer the windows Phone, it could be a minor detail to some, is searching through apps and contact list. Lets say I want to scroll to the bottom of my contacts or apps list. All i would do is hit the letter and touch Z which will take me to the bottom of the list. These are one of the many minor details in the Windows phone OS that I enjoy so much and why I prefer it over iOS. The lack of this on the iPhone gives me the sense that Apple is failing to keep up with the times. The hardware on the Lumia 920. If you're coming from an iPhone, it's definitely going to take some time getting use to. I would say the Lumia 920 is a hunky piece of hardware, but once you're use to the larger screen. You'll begin to question why you've stayed on a 3.5 screen or even 4 inch all this time. The screen on the 920 is just gorgeous. It's clear and crisps compared to the Lumia 900. It's on par or even better than the iPhone 5, but definitely an upgrade from the Lumia 900. The camera is touted as one of the best and I'll agree with that statement. Compared to the iPhone 4/4s, This phone knocks it out of the ball park. I haven't directly compared the iPhone 5 to the Lumia 920's camera but from what I recall the iPhone 5 and 4s are very similar when I compared the two. I think the camera on the Lumia 920 captures more detail as oppose to the iPhone 4s. The flash on the Lumia 920 isn't as bright as the iPhone 4s but it does get the job done. Sometimes on the 4s, The flash causes the picture look washed out mainly because of too much lighting. Aesthetics and feel of the hardware. I've held the iPhone 5, it's a beautiful device, very light, clean, well designed, very impressive with what Apple did. The Lumia 920 on the other hand, I can could almost say the same but entirely in a different way. The curved gorilla glass display of the Lumia 920 adds elegance and beauty unlike any other phone on the market. It's Solid, thick and heavy but the curved back of device allows it to sit comfortably in your hands. It feel as if it was as thin as the iPhone 5. Some of my peeves about the Lumia 920. The lack of Bing maps, Nokia maps just doesn't do it for me. Doesn't offer voice command inputs something I would recommend while driving. I've been hearing Nokia maps will be the standard mapping app for all windows phone 8 device. I just hope with future updates that Nokia will offer voice command in all aspect of their mapping software. The weight of the phone need to be reduce, it's a heavy device. I'm sure some people would be bothered by this. Having it on your pocket all day could get bit annoying. Also I like to mention is the lack of notification center. Which I think is pretty important, it's smart to have a notification center and Apple recognized this and added it in on iOS 5.0. I'm a bit surprised MS didn't add this into WP8 but ill leave this to Microsoft to handle and not Nokia. Bottom line is the Lumia 920 can do anything the iPhone 5 can do it (hardware wise). You might hear the lack of software, but the selection is rapidly growing. To the average user all the popular apps are there. This is definitely the time to switch if you've been considering a Windows Phone.",60.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

4921,B00O15MWOM,piginspandex,2,13-Mar-15,False,Garbage,"So, I had a Nokia 521, which I loved, but since it updated to Windows 8.1 it became dreadfully sluggish. I thought I would ""upgrade"" to a 530, which has a faster processor and comes with Windows 8.1 out of the box. I didn't realize it was a HORRIBLE downgrade. Now, keep in mind, for $50 this is a pretty nifty smartphone, but it is SO buggy and obnoxious that I would much rather use the older 521 model. So, the 530 I bought couldn't connect to GPS about 90% of the time. It would find my location (I could see landmarks) but no street names and so it couldn't do turn by turn navigation. I contacted T-mobile about the problem and they blame Nokia, meanwhile Nokia blames the app itself (an app which, by the way, is included and works perfectly on the 521, but which you must install and it doesn't really work on the 530). Since the whole reason I bought a smartphone was pretty much for GPS purposes this was a big problem. I returned it and had it replaced, but the new one has the same problem! So, it is an issue with the model, not with the individual phone. Anyway, having now had TWO 530s, I can say without a doubt that mine was not a lemon, but in fact typical. Some other problems: 1) Coverage is terrible. Constantly drops down to 2G or 4G with no bars. I live in a major city (Washington DC), there is no excuse for this. Where my 521 has 5 bars, this has 3. Where my 521 has 3 bars, this has 2G. Unacceptable. 2) Again, the location services and maps don't come preloaded and don't work. GPS function is rubbish. 3) My hair constantly gets caught in the phone! Not between the cover and the phone, on the little wiggle on the phone itself. I literally have a bald patch right on the front of my head from using this thing. 4) The phone screen is super sensitive; I am constantly putting people I am talking to on hold, on mute, or on speaker. Never had this problem with the 521 even though the set-up is similar. Some of these are big and some are small, but if you think about how many times you use your phone it adds up to a very frustrating experience. So...is it worth it? It's certainly better than a not smartphone, and it's not very expensive (thus 2 stars, 1 star seems a little harsh for a smartphone under 50 bucks) but it is SO badly built and SO frustrating and SO buggy that I would not recommend it. I am quite seriously thinking of throwing this thing in the trash even though it's fully (to its own extent) operational, that's how much I hate this thing. It's no iPhone and I don't expect it to be, but it IS a serious downgrade from the fantastic 521.",15.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 530 White - No Contract (T-Mobile),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-530-White-Contract/dp/B00O15MWOM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ba7gOGt5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00O15MWOM,378,133.28,0.0

1407,B00A2V7BA4,O_Man,5,13-Jun-14,True,Just aamzing!,"For an almost 2 year old phone, it still feels pretty darn modern! I've had one since it came out, and I bought one for my husband back in February because he was sick of all the issues with his Samsung and Motorola Android phones: poor bluetooth connectivity, constantly freezing, poor battery life, he always complained that it felt cheap (like it was about to fall apart, from day one), apps always crashing, frequently rebooting itself. The list goes on. We both love Windows Phone 8, and even upgraded to 8.1 under the Developer Preview program. It's fast, reliable, and smooth. You really have control over the bulk of the phones functionality, including what apps can run in the background. Mine, as I said is 1.5~ years old, and the battery is just as reliable (maybe a little more so with recent updates) as when I first got it, and I use it pretty heavily on a daily bases, especially when traveling. I have never once placed a screen protector on it, because I hate how they make the phone/screen look. I have had people knock it out of my hand, kittens run across it full speed with claws out, dropped keys on the screen (accidentally when putting them in the search-bin at the airport), and it only has 1 scratch on the screen. Just one, that you can only see at the right angle. We both love this phone, and plan to get the next ""version"" of it when it comes out (hopefully towards the end of the year; Bing/Google Nokia Goldfinger or Nokia Mclaren).

2325,B00CQAODG4,MoultonHawk,5,13-Jun-13,True,Yea Buddy...,"My target price was free to $50. This was the highest rated and reviewed phone and new as of 4th quarter 2012 in that price range available w/ Verizon. I wanted something different than my old starter Thunderbolt HTC, didn't want to pay for a new iphone, didn't want to go with an older Samsung. I liked the way the Windows phone looked, and I'm always into the underdog as a rule anyway. I had issues getting the sim card to sync, but that had a lot to do with Verizon not flipping the switch from old to new, and I forgot to pull the battery out of my old phone to make sure it was off so it's recognized properly. Phone is a beauty, it's like going from SD to HD with a TV, just looks gorgeous. I was able to move my contacts easily with a transfer app, free. I already dl Pandora and am playing music on this bad boy. Thunderbolt had low sound, this is much better. I love Windows 8 so far easy to pull up everything you need on that front page, THIS IS HUGE TO ME, easy breezy lemon peezy. I really think this phone is more cutting edge than iphones, samsungs, htc's except for the brand spanking new ones, windows phones just are the unknown for most folks. Give this one a shot. I love it, huge upgrade for me. CNET: The good: Nokia's Lumia 928 introduces a slimmer body and straight, grippable sides. Low light camera performance is top-notch. The bad: Verizon's typically blazing speeds stumbled on the Lumia 928, and call quality sounded harsher than Nokia's usual standard. Those looking for Nokia's bright statement hues won't find them here. (I don't find faults with either of these issues the reviewer had, and either did any of the reviews I read) The bottom line: Windows Phone fans on Verizon should buy the $100 Nokia Lumia 928 (I paid $49.99 on Amazon family plan) for its strong feature set, but watch out for slower-than-usual data speeds. CNET Users: 4.5/5 based on 8 reviews ***Update: I'm not a normal user, because I get free use of the phone on my family plan so I'm limited in data usage. So a few notes. This is the prettiest phone I've ever had, slick as heck, beuatiful screens, great having all your apps on the front page with all the customization you want, nice easy to use camera. However, this phone is super sensitive to water. I'm talking drops when I clean the screen with a cleaner, or a light overspray from the sink, the phone can flip out. You can't take the battery out to reset it. I couldn;t even figure out how to manually shut it off, cuz you normally shut it off slide screen and when that was frozen I panicked. You hold power and volume down to pass the slide screen when stuck. I thought my phone was dead over the weekend, touch screen didn't work, I couldn't turn it off because of that.I t finally shut off from the battery dying and restarted good as new. So a very very light spray on a microfiber cloth is my next move to clean it. Other issue is apps, like instagram isn't compatable yet, there aren't normal iphone and android apps available always, very anoying. Otherwise it's a brilliant phone.

15331,B075FL4H89,{},5,13-Jul-19,True,Excellent Alternative to a Smartphone,"I purchased the Nokia 3310 3G about half a year ago because I wanted to see if I could survive without taking my smartphone everywhere. And I have grown to love it since then. This phone is very boring, and that is probably the best complement I could give it. I have found no temptation whatsoever to pull it out and scroll through social media or read the news as I was waiting in line or having a conversation, which forces me to live in the real world. It's great for phone calls and texting, and not much else. The battery life lasts many times longer than my smartphone did, as well. Obviously, the camera on this device is capable of taking a photo for reference or remembering something, but it would not be a good idea to use it for any artistic purposes as it is of rather low quality. I have found that this has helped me to enjoy beautiful sunsets and scenery without worrying about trying to get a good picture to share. The signal reception on this phone seems to be about as good as any other phone I have used, and it has not really been a problem. The physical design is relatively sturdy, and I have not had any major problems with it (although the plastic back has gotten scratched up from daily use). It is much smaller than a smartphone, and it fits in my hand or pocket easily. The user interface doesn't seem to just be a copy of cheap phones from the past decade; I believe it is actually much better designed for ease of use and quickly accessing important options, and I think it looks rather nice. (It also doesn't split long text messages like old dumbphones used to, which is great.)

As a phone you cant beat the price for what you get its a really nice phone and the Android one gives a silky smooth experience. Although it is a very nice phone I did run into one critical issue, I was playing Pokemon go the second day of owning the phone. The game along with the phone froze, everything was unresponsive and I had to hard shut off the phone. When the phone restarted it went into an infinite boot loop, usually not a big issue when you access the boot menu holding down the required buttons and doing a factory reset. The big let down for me was that this phone cannot access that boot menu while going though a boot loop. this phone has to follow a sequence of operations which is power off completely, plug in power cord, hit volume and power keys then access the boot menu, but since the phone never fully powers down while boot looping I found it impossible to get my phone to operate normally. I even contacted Nokia support and the only thing they were recommending I should do is replace the phone. This is very unfortunate since in order to get a new phone or replacement I have to wait for the whole shipping process all over again. I had to return for a full refund instead of getting it replaced with a new one because I feel like this is an unreliable phone if it where to crash.

It came with enough battery charge to start the first operations all right, but to my surprise, it did not recognize my WiFi (it recognized ALL the other neighbors' WiFi but NOT MINE). I am not a very savvy person nor a geek about WiFi, so I decided to continue and placed my AT&T SIM card and continue, but another sad surprise: it did not recognize my card neither! That was enough for me. I returned the phone to Amazon after having it for less than 30 minutes! Thankful for the excellent return service from Amazon. I will get my refund in a couple of days and try to concentrate into another brand.

Lucky or so I thought. Initially I was impressed, big screen, loved WP8 (mostly but the OS issues I will leave for an OS specific review site), audio initially sounded great. My first major issue was the camera button, way to easy to push accidentally. I took more photos of my pocket and side of my car then I had ever with all previous phones, granted they were great pictures, when they didn't blur, but basically useless. The other problem I had was the cell reception on the phone. It would constantly jump around between 1-5 bars, literally all over the place. Initially I thought it might be my location, but I had two other Verizon phones (HTC Trophy & Casino g'Zone Ravine 2) that didn't have that problem. Anywhere I went, reception was all over the place. The bars on my phone were more hyper than a Jack Russel Terrier. Other than that I didn't have any problems, for about 25+ days. Then out of nowhere, the camera failed, camera app would not load, even the flashlight app wouldn't turn on (flash on phone attached to camera). Around the same time, the ear speaker also failed. Voices would constantly cut-out, to the point where I could ONLY talk to people on speaker-phone. I tried every suggestion to fix, soft-reset, hard-reset, hard-reset without restoring anything (that hurt). Had to send the phone into Verizon and get a refurb (they already had refurbs less than a month after this model had been released, scary). I got the refurb, and after less than two weeks (Verizon had not even received by first unit back by mail yet!!) the same problem with the ear speaker happens (voices cut-out, must use speaker-phone). So now I am sending this back and they are sending me an HTC 8x WP.

As it turns out, the phone is unlocked. No issues there. Also, I'm not on AT&T. I'm on Simple Mobile, which runs on TMobile, so my comment on 3g/4g speeds will be non-existent. 1. Fantastic reception on the phone so far. Where I couldn't get reception in the past, I get a strong signal on this phone. Many people blame reception solely on networks, but obviously phone reception plays a part. 2. Enough apps for me. I'm not a mass appeal games freak, so I'm not going to lose the plot at the fewer games available, and, heaven forbid, needing to pay $0.99 for Angry birds. I can get all the other things that I want, either the same app as Android or by a third party that fulfills the same function (was on android before this) 3. The battery life is ok. It lasts through a day and then some, of course depending what you use it for. I use the phone for calls, some surfing, apps for a range of thing from weather to my Sonos to the kindle. 4. Fantastic price. I know Lumia 920 is out but I also know a one year old model is young enough to be relevant and old enough to receive the shipment of the model without the initial launch quirks. 5. Xbo smartglass works well, which isn't a big deal but it's a nice convenience when I'm watching netflix on the xbox from the bed. 6. Stable. Actually stable. 7. The ringer volume has a huge range. That was an issue with my last phone. I like the range. 0-30. As time goes by I'm sure I'll have more to add and maybe it'll show itself to be a dud (though I honestly hope not). Maybe some day Tmobile/Simple Mobile will add the required frequency to get 3g on this phone but I have no issues with Edge for what I use the data access for and I'm mightly pleased with this pretty piece of mobile technology.

As someone who was a big fan of the iPhone 5 metal cases, the Nokia line was very attractive. I ordered the copper colored phone and was slightly disappointed that their definition of copper could also be confused for ""rose gold"" - there's just a hint of pink. It's still a cool looking phone though, and definitely sets itself apart from the generic black model that Samsung and HTC put out over and over again. I believe the draw-rate of the GPU is a little slow in this thing (as in, not instantaneous but still more than acceptable), but other than that, I have absolutely no performance issues. The fact that this thing comes without bloatware (just a clean Android install and nothing more) is a major selling point. After Huaweii's state-run integrated spyware became public knowledge, I was wary buying a phone from China (this is not the old Nokia, just a benevolent Chinese company wearing the shirt).

The amount of apps Nokia continue to push out, along with their support, make this phone a no brainer to purchase. I've used Android as well as iOS, and yes WP OS is really a breath of fresh air and a joy to use. I can honestly say the ""Live Tiles"" are addictive and you won't just put your phone up in your pocket. It(OS) makes you continue using your phone for everything possible. Anyway, enough about the OS, more about the phone. This is one of the best built phones ever! Of course you will have fans of the 800, 900 & N9, all are pretty much the same with small differences(screen build and size).

15484,B075FLG6MV,Greg Melnyk,5,13-Aug-18,True,A Solid Budget Device,"I purchased this for my wife to replace a Nokia Lumia 521. She uses it primarily for phone and text, and taking pictures. It is a perfectly adequate device for her needs (and is reviewed in that context). Coming from the unsupported Windows Phone ecosystem, it was also a nice perk to install a few home automation apps on the new phone. This device will not win any awards for speed, but in this case, that isn't an issue. It calls, it texts, it takes pictures. Switching between apps is a little slow, but not annoyingly so. It is pretty much stock Android (as of this review, it is running Android 7.1.1, 8.1 is in beta for the device but I won't subject my spouse to beta testing). The build quality of the device is top notch. It feels more like a mid-range device than a budget handset (especially compared to the old Lumia 521). The screen is clear and sharp. I added a basic case and screen protector to the phone just in case. Storage is definitely a compromise. After installing updates, about 3 GB of 8 GB were still free. If you want to install apps or take pictures, you'll want a microSD card. Fortunately we had one from her old phone, so that wasn't any extra cost at this time. Overall, this is a solid budget device, and I definitely recommend it. Pros: -Low cost -Stock Android -Receives Android updates -Good build quality -Decent battery life -Nice screen Cons (this is a budget device and these are definitely not dealbreakers): -A little slow -Low storage",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 2 - Android - 8GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5"" Screen - Black - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B075FLG6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-rum+PvIL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FLG6MV,359,194.97,0.0
15313,B075FL4H89,Sashy,3,13-Aug-18,True,"3G only is a liability, minor usability issues","Update summer 2019: Since this phone is 3G only, it is going to have increasing problems getting coverage in the USA, where many carriers have or are in the process of switching off their 3G signals. It works for me in Oregon with T-Mobile if I turn on data roaming, but your mileage may vary depending on carrier and location. ------------- Original review: I love how small and light it is, the way all phones used to be! I'm using it with Red Pocket wireless $10/month plan which uses the T-Mobile network, and it does a good job with calling, texting, and (VERY) basic web stuff. Only a few minor nitpicks... Unlike other Nokias I've used there are not many options for tweaking the user interface - for instance you can't change the main menu from a grid to a list, there's no customizable ""Go To"" shortcut menu, and the direction keys don't do anything on the home screen. This doesn't really make the phone worse, it's just that if they had been included that would have been better. As far as physical usability, the labels on the buttons are small can be hard to read when you're in a medium-lit room indoors - the illumination in the buttons makes the numbers wash out. So this might be an issue if you're looking for a basic phone for grandma etc. Also while we're on the grandma topic, the direction key (which surrounds the select key) is small and thin, so it may be difficult for someone with large fingers or dexterity issues.

If you are considering a windows phone, you would be doing a disservice to yourself by buying something other than a Nokia.

If you will not settle for a non official instagram, vine, or snapchat app you will be frustrated. 3rd party apps exist for all of the above though, so really you could stop whining IMO.

1816,B00A7F57EM,Techno Guru 2014,4,13-Apr-13,False,Excellent 4G LTE Smartphone with some limitations,"I purchased this phone as an emergency backup phone should my primary (Samsung Galaxy Note II) ever need repair or be out of commission. I was able to pick one up off Ebay for roughly $140.00 and it was one of the better investments I have made. Before writing this review I will tell you a little about my tech experience: I've been with verizon for over 8 years, have used IOS, Android (current) and intermittently used Windows Phone Operating System. Each operating system (and ecosystem) has its advantages and disadvantages, as does the manufacturer. Let's begin with what the Nokia Lumia 822 has going for it. Pros: Build Quality-- The Nokia Lumia 822 is exceptionally well made. While thicker than most smartphones currently on the market, this phone feels surprisingly good in the hands. The weight is evenly distributed throughout the body of the phone, and all the necessary buttons (i.e. power, volume, and camera) are located on the right-side for easy one-handed use. The true black display is 4.3"" and is doing a well job of displaying color. This phone is readily viewable outdoors at 75% brightness, and the Gorilla Glass 2 glass panel is very durable (Though I would still recommend a SKINOMI TECH SKIN SCREEN PROTECTOR for added protection). Battery Life-- The Lumia comes with a 2100MHA battery. This is one of the largest OEM standard batteries a manufacturer can put in a phone right out of the box. (For instance, the original galaxy nexus on verizon only came with a 1800, with an extended that pushed 2100). Depending on your use the phone can last a solid 20hours of light-moderate use, and roughly 12-14 hours of heavy use (I define heavy use as video streaming). This is respectable battery duration and let's face it, most people will have a charger in the car, carry an external battery backup etc. Operating System: Windows Phone 8 Operating System is extremely user friendly. You are limited in personalization but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Live-tiles (which are re-sizeable) dominant the viewing screen and like with most functions, a single tap opens the desired program. Unlike other operating systems (i.e. android and IOS phones), windows phone provides you the ability to REMOVE BLOATWARE FROM YOUR DEVICE WITHOUT THE NEED OF ROOTING/JAILBREAKING. This, for me, is a huge plus as rooting a device generally voids your warranting at you run the risk of damaging (bricking) your phone. Manufacturer Support/Investment-- Nokia's suite of apps are simply AMAZING. You get Nokia Map/Drive and Nokia Go-Music. The Nokia Map/Drive is similar to Google Maps and Navigation. The Nokia Go-Music is a FREE music streaming service native on all Nokia smartphones. This app is similar to Pandora but unlike Pandora it is commercial free, you do not need to register, and you are allowed to download approximately ~250songs for offline use. Nokia customer/tech support is also one of the best. GLOBAL ROAMING/UNLOCKED-- One of the primary reasons I bought the lumia is that ALL WINDOWS PHONES FROM NOKIA ARE REGION-FREE SIM UNLOCKED. Meaning, so long as the carrier (other than verizon) produces the cell bands the phone's modem can pick up, you will be able to use the phone on that network. The Lumia 822 CAN BE USED ON T-MOBILE, ATT, ROGERS... and EVEN OVER SEAS. Verizon, a CDMA network, offers very few phones that are unlocked, let alone as capable of being used on GSM networks. So not only is this phone a good back-up phone, it's also a phone which can be used in case you want to switch carriers and don't want to sign a 2year contract/buy a new phone. Cons: Lack of Developer Investment-- The Windows Store has roughly 150,000 apps on the market, as compared to IOS and Google which have over 700,000. The list of apps also grows very slowly in Windows Store-- some of the more popular apps aren't available either. Lack of Mainstream Appeal-- The lack of personalization is a deterrent for some. The live tiles can get boring. >>List will be updated at a later date",3.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 822 16GB Windows Phone Black - Verizon,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Windows-Phone-Black/dp/B00A7F57EM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jxGoYUWTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A7F57EM,62,204.16,0.0

4146,B00KM10ITK,J. Pearson,4,12-Sep-15,True,Good for an entry level Windows phone/Be Conscious of Seller,"Nokia Lumia 635 is an okay to good phone for an entry level Windows/Smartphone. This had Windows 8.1 on it and functions well. Allows for basic needs of calling, texting, email, internet, and apps. Only issue is to beware of the seller in the marketplace even if it is fulfilled by Amazon. The listing here mentions ""Unlocked GSM 4G LTE"" but some sellers just send AT&T GoPhone which are locked to the AT&T network. If the seller sends a genuine UNLOCKED mobile/cellphone then it will work on the 4G LTE networks in the USA. The 4G LTE network in the USA usually is the 1900 band which this phone is capable. Pros on the phone A. Fast boot up B. Apps are fairly nice C. Feels sturdy in the hands D. Not a gigantic feel like some phones Cons of the Phone A. Cortana keeps popping up even if you don't want to use it (This depends on your preference) B. Transfer Data from old Nokia phones requires an app, simple bluetooth transfer/sync didn't work with our older Nokia phones. Overall, mostly satisfied for a basic Windows Nokia phone. The main point is beware and conscious of the seller in the marketplace, even if it is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"". The seller that was fulfilled by Amazon was ""Reliable Communication"" and it was an AT&T GoPhone not completely unlocked. EDIT: As I continue to monitor feedback on my reviews and the comments I left on seller, I noticed my seller review was deleted. So this confirms my advice about being cautious on who you choose. ""Reliable Communication"" seller I would steer clear from completely. Very shady seller. Choose a seller who has had good feedback and a long positive history even if ""Fulfilled By Amazon"" is there. Phone still works good as a basic entry level Windows phone.

20696,B07HD3QC65,Robert H. Buckley,5,12-Mar-19,True,Nokia's Android One makes maximum use of memory,"I bought this after reading countless reviews of 'mid-range' phones. Because my otherwise wonderful Galaxy had run out of capability with its uncompetitive 3/16 memory I decided to bet on this one. Having once owned a Nokia clamshell and a Nokia Windows phone I expected something pretty good and I think I got it with the 7.1. For brevity I'll say that the camera is excellent and the variable focus 'Bokeh' setting is a plus. I have no need to lug a digital camera around anymore. The phone dimensions give it a comfortable feel in the hand and more of a sense of holding a traditional phone. The great advantage to me lies in its being Android One and therefore not burdened with manufacturer vanity apps which take up space and cannot be deleted (my Samsung was one of these). That means that with its 4GB/64GB memory you have plenty of headroom to personalize the phone the way you like. There is a second SIM slot which doubles as SD storage if you really need it. I've used the phone intensively in the last couple of weeks while paying attention to what other reviewers have described as weaknesses. The first was the statement that volume is weak especially when on loud speaker. This is not true for me, the maximum volume shakes my eardrums. The second complaint had to do with a vague stutter, or hesitation that occurs when responding to a command. I have seen this- sometimes on swiping and sometimes from a key command, to the extent that I wonder if my tap failed and I try again. This behavior is rare, the phone in fact has not stopped working, and it's not serious enough for me to really complain about it. I have no idea what causes it. A note about apps- a few apps for basic operation are preinstalled and after that you rely on the Play store. The included Google file manager did not allow for file/folder shortcuts to desktop and for me that's important. The only third party app I know that still works for this with Android 9 is ES File Explorer. I should add that the phone came with Oreo and updated to Pie as soon as I stuck a SIM chip in it. It also carries a one year warranty, though not for accident. Finally one minor gripe- the Nokia manual is a real dud. I'm very happy with my purchase at the price and because I'm not a flagship phone buyer I'm inclined to think that overall this is about the best bargain currently available.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0
15552,B075FLG6MV,pierre.wheaton,4,12-Mar-18,True,An odd mix of high and low end features.,"This is a phone with a weird set of features and components. It has a chassis made from a single piece of aluminum, a Corning Gorilla glass screen and a big honking 4,100 mah battery. Parts that would be found on higher end smartphones, but also has a slowish Snapdragon 210 processor, 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM. The user can add an SD card and Nougat can format the card so that it can act as an expansion on the paltry internal storage. I have a 64GB SD card on this phone which expands the 8GB into approx 70GB. But not all Android apps are designed to run off the SD card. The starting 8GB would be standard on a smartphone from five years ago. The phone comes with Android Nougat out of the box and Nokia says that it will get Oreo 8.1 when it passes muster. It also has dual SIM capability which is good for travelers. The Android experience is almost pure. Only a few items like a Nokia support app and FM radio are added extras. The screen is pretty good. It is a bit laggy as a phone with the low amount of RAM, the low end CPU and internal storage would have. I ran a Geekbench 4 benchmark on this phone and it did not fare well. The Nokia 2 fell below the least powerful phone in the benchmark, The Nexus 5. A phone that's been obsolete for almost three years. So for those who are into speeds and feeds and are looking for the newest and fastest, this phone is a dog. Battery life is very good. I've had the phone on for close to 24 hours with average usage and mostly the stock apps installed, only about 10 apps of my choosing installed and it's at 77%. I have yet to run the battery down to zero. If you are looking for an entry level smartphone for a low price for a child or a first time or light phone user who's not going to push this phone's capabilities to the edge, the Nokia 2 is a servicable device. Pros- 1. Quality build. 2. Low Price 3. 4,100mah battery = excellent battery life. 4. Nice camera and screen. 5. Nougat out of the box with Oreo coming. 6. Mostly pure Android experience. Cons- 1.

I really regret that decision because the phone is horrible in every word,i got this phone in august of 2017 and I really regret that decision because the phone is horrible in every word. 1. you can take a picture and find out later it was not saved because the app itself takes long time to save the picture and if you close it before that it does not save it 2. messaging app is horrible and doesn't allow either group msgs or sending pics 3. the phone only charges with its own charger or it wont really charge even if you connect it to a laptop. 4. sometimes you save a contact and find out later it only saved the first 2 numbers. 5. it crashes a lot and often is very slow or processing. 6. it feels like the phone is very primitive and is not really worth that much money at all. 7. the music app that comes with it is horrible and you have to use a third party app or something. 8. if the weather is cold and you try to use the phone it starts crashing.,1.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

The Nokia 4.2 can be provisioned to work on the AT&T network, but in most markets, will not be able to work on the 4G/LTE channels. What does this mean? Without LTE, your mobile data speeds will be reduced to about 6mbs download (on a good day, with a good signal) to less than 1mbs (most common conditions). Upload speeds are about 20% of the D/L speed. This incompatibility needs to be more clearly indicated. (For techies: this phone only has a few of the authorized LTE frequencies, and does not include those most frequently used by AT&T.) For those who do not need LTE speeds for data, this phone does offer very long battery life. The screen is acceptable if you view it straight-on (the LCD has a narrow viewing range, which is helpful in preventing someone sitting next to you from ""couch-surfing"" your info.) The adaptive brightness control really needs to either be turned off entirely OR manually push the brightness to more than 70%, before turning on the adaptive brightness control.

14207,B071ZDQ6MV,Harry Sachs,1,12-Jul-17,True,Frustrating experience with this phone.,"Update 8-16-17 After a month and 3 days of consistent functioning the phone will no longer make or receive calls or consistently connect to cellular data. I am traveling with my wife who is still using her Galaxy S5 on the same wireless service as I and while her 2.5 year old Samsung works flawlessly as usual I am stuck with a phone that only works with wifi. I have been in contact with about 10 different customer service reps from Nokia and must say it has been the worst experience, nobody is able or willing to try any troubleshooting and the only option I have at this point is to delete everything and return to Nokia for repair leaving me phoneless for an indefinite amount of time which doesn't work for me. Unfortunately I am 3 days beyond the Amazon return window. I wish I could go back in time and buy a different phone. Please do yourself a favor and Google the ratings for Nokia customer service and realize that nobody will help you when your phone stops working after a month. Please, please, please wait until Nokia fixes all the problems with this phone before winding up in a place that you don't want to be like on the road without a phone like me. Initial review: The phone itself seems sturdy yet thin. I was unable to even set it up due to the phone not seeing my router on the network. Getting a replacement and I'll give a better review of the phone once I get a working one. Replacement received and has the same problem. Seemingly every device under the sun can see and connect to my home router but this phone. I contacted nokia customer support and they are telling me to flip through the channels on my router? I like the hardware of this phone but seeing how it requires a lot of tech knowhow just to simply connect to your wifi I may need to return the second one. Update: I fixed the wifi issue. Apparently the phone doesn't recognize routers on certain channels. My routers default settings had an ""auto"" channel setting which had my router using channel 10. I changed the channel on my router to channel 7 using the router administration tools. I have never had to do this for any network connected device to date. I hope this doesn't prove to be an issue while traveling or at friends and families networks. So far, I like the size and speed of the phone. I am retiring my Samsung Galaxy s5 and this is bigger, lighter and faster with only minor changes to the android experience. After less than a day with this phone working as it should I would say I like the phone note than the s5.",12.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

1442,B00A2V7BA4,Amazon Customer,5,12-Jul-13,False,Best Mobile Phone I've Owned,"I can't say enough good things about the Nokia 920. I've been very impressed so far. My last two phones were a Samsung Focus S running Windows Phone 7 which I enjoyed, except for the small amount of good apps compared to iOS and Android. But Windows Phone 8 is next level -- especially with all the quality apps that are now available. Software developers are clearly jumping on board now. Prior to trying the Windows Phone OS I owned an iPhone 3G. The Windows Phone OS, WP8 in particular, is superior to iOS in so many ways. It all starts with the user interface. While iOS and Android use fairly similar desktop based interfaces with icons we've known since the early 90s, Microsoft actually innovated with Windows Phone and created something unique. While I'm not as excited about the smart tile interface on a large desktop screen; it is excellent on a phone, tablet, or smaller laptop. The Nokia hardware itself is very impressive. The phone is responsive and has never crashed on me once -- something I can't say for my iPhone 3GS or Samsung. My only complaint is the phone does feel a bit heavy - but it also has a very nice camera and the battery life is longer than last two phones (even with the new phone using 4G LTE). The Nokia build quality definitely feels sturdier than the Samsung I owned. The Samsung was lighter, but it also felt like cheaper plastic at times. My other complaint with the Nokia is it doesn't appear the battery can easily be removed/replaced. Nokia should fix that and not follow the iPhone route with battery access. To me, the bottom line is despite being late to the game, Windows Phone 8 is by far the best mobile phone OS. Not only that, the 920 is a great value. I got one for $100 with a 2-yr contract renewal. If you have AT&T, you may want to wait though. The 920 is awesome, but if you take a lot of photos, Nokia has announced a newer Lumia model with a camera in the 40 megapixel range (sorry I don't have exact number). It will be by far the best camera in a mobile phone ever. I've read it will retail for $299 with a 2-yr contract. The Lumia 920 is still an excellent choice. It has gotten very good reviews -- PC world gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 -- the same rating they give the iPhone and Galaxy 3. It may not be the ""coolest"" phone right now, but if you aren't a teenager -- try it out and I think you'll be pleased.",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

17922,B079NM9SZL,Sung Kim,5,12-Dec-19,True,Great phone for the value,"I needed a temporary phone, because my 3-year-old Samsung Galaxy S7 finally died. I found this phone under $100 and decided to give it a try. I love the design, it slips out of your hand very easily due to glossy surface, so you will definitely need a good case. The fingerprint option works great (I did not have any fingerprint or face recognition option from my previous phone so this is definitely a good upgrade.) I use AT&T, the connection is good with calls, texts, internet, and data. All I had to was transfer the sim card with sim-card-tool that came with the phone. I didn't have to visit AT&T or inform them. The phone is little slow with processing when it is connected for data usage (compared to when I use Wi-Fi at home or office). The only downside is that system memory is only 16GB. This means, even if I buy a memory card of 128GB, I will only be able to use that for photos and videos that I manually transfer. If I want to download more app or do system upgrade, I may easily run out of space. It seems like Nokia 3 had option of saving app to memory card but this one Nokia 5 does not support that. I may look into other Nokia phone with higher system memory rather than spending about $1,000 on Apple or Samsung phones (I have used iPhone 3, iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S7 in the past), because so far my experiences with this Nokia phone has been great.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 5 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - Blue",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-Metropcs/dp/B079NM9SZL,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OGbwPc-DL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B079NM9SZL,45,89.0,0.0

On top of that they had the arrogance to change their proprietary connector that they forced on everyone and changed it to yet another proprietary connector!!! I got the Nokia 920 and after less than a day of using it I would never even consider going back to an iPhone again! Compared to Windows 8 the Apple system feels like a toy.

1435,B00A2V7BA4,Kathryn G,5,12-Dec-12,False,Newbie Impression,"Newbie because I've owned only a few smart phones, but a ton of other regular phones. Tough, ruggedized phones, flip phones, regular bar phones. I'm not really hard on my phones, I keep them tucked away or on a bedside table, but it infuriates me about phones that have broken during normal use. I don't live, eat and breathe by my phone. However, I live in a very rural area now, on 20 acres. It's crucial for me to have a working phone with me more often now. As a former web developer, I am no fan of Apple or windows (Microsoft) in particular, (Linux all the way baby). But I am mostly sick of Apple and it's high priced products and exclusivity. Android was okay for me, but still when I suddenly need to accept a call or check a text message, it took a little bit too long for me to get the phone to do what it was supposed to. I feel Android is still not as user friendly as the Apple OS or Windows live tiles. I have played with a lot of newer phones at this point. I don't plan on putting Windows 8 on my PC (Ubuntu instead). But I really like the live tiles Windows has developed for phones. It's a no brain-er for me so far. I received the phone last night. Just charged it up, played a little with all the settings, etc. Today I woke with massive problems with my two dogs. I had to contact my daughter at work, in town, 30 mins away. It was super easy to pick the phone up, in my very frazzled, sleep deprived state, and send her some quick text messages and calls. I like that the live tiles can be three sizes and moved around, and different colors can be chosen. The screen is very responsive but not ultra, stupid sensitive. I am debating whether or not to get a screen protector (can anyone give me a recommendation for this? Necessary or not?). My last samsung phone with a touch screen was very annoying with a protector on it. I eventually ripped it off and just settled on the fact that the darn screen is going to be scratched no matter what. I think this Nokia is a big phone but I like the screen size for checking up on my web site, orders for wood crafting things I make, etc. I am a former photographer also and was attracted to the Carl Zeiss optics. I've owned many CZ lenses for my Nikon in the past and there is no equal. Let's hope that is the same for these CZ phone optics. Sound ability seems awesome. Very easy set up when I got the phone, no issues. Waited 3 weeks at the screaming deal Amazonwireless was offering. Worth the wait.

15320,B075FL4H89,Adam B. Bugay,4,12-Aug-18,True,The rebirth of the classic Nokia cell phone is here!,"The Nokia 3310 3G phone is a fresh update on the classic design that adds new features while staying true to it's classic roots. If you don't need a smartphone or need a solid backup cell phone, here are some reasons why you might want to take a serious look at this little Nokia phone: 1. It's got awesome battery life. The Nokia 3310's battery life is superb. Nokia says it can last for up to a month on a single charge, and while I haven't been able to test this fully, it's managed to last a long weekend of taking photos, listening to music and playing Snake without needing charging. It makes the perfect backup phone that you can leave in the glovebox of your car or buried deep in your purse, for those times when you need a phone in a pinch, this thing never wants to die. 2. It's a cheap, solid budget entry phone. The 3310 costs around $50, and is vastly cheaper than the fancy phone you probably already have in your pocket. Losing it would be a bummer, but replacing it is a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of replacing a new Galaxy S8 ($520 at Amazon.com). 3. You won't need a case. With a body made from stiff plastic and no massive glass touchscreen to protect, the Nokia 3310 can take a few knocks without waving the white flag. I repeatedly dropped my review model on grass, wood and concrete from pocket height and despite a few scuffs, it still works absolutely fine. 4. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing. The original 3310 has rightly become a classic icon of mobile phone history, and while this modern iteration is slimmer and more rounded, it's a worthy successor to the 3310 we knew and loved in the early 2000s. The perfect update to a modern classic. 5. It's great for young kids too! The Nokia 3310 would be a solid first cell phone for any young kid in your life. It's cheap enough to give you a line of contact with your kids without you worrying that they'll lose it. It's strong enough that you won't have to pay to replace a cracked screen. And since there's barely any internet to speak of, they won't be glued to their cell phone screen's all day. 6. The classic game Snake returns! Snake is back, and with updated graphics, it's looking better than ever. Pure nostalgic bliss. Now, for the not so good qualities of the Nokia 3310: 1. No interchangeable covers. The days of swapping phone covers with virtually any design you can think of are sadly over with this phone, as now it comes in solid, but vivid colors to choose from when you purchase it. That's it. 2. Lack of apps can be a drag at times. Yes, it's great having a phone with a battery you don't need to worry about, and also using a distraction free phone you won't lose hours of your life in, but its total lack of smart features means it's unlikely ever to become your main go to handset. Overall, this retake of a modern classic in the Nokia 33210 really is a breath of fresh air, and is an excellent option for young children & as a backup/emergency/burner phone. $50 well spent.",13.0,Nokia,Nokia 3310 3G - Unlocked Single SIM Feature Phone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 2.4 Inch Screen - Charcoal,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3310-3G-Unlocked-T-Mobile/dp/B075FL4H89,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iQ4QgMchL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FL4H89,497,54.99,59.0

2440,B00CS2ZWKQ,Chris Lee Mullins,3,12-Aug-13,False,Great Uncomplicated OS - Jury is still out on the firmware,"Bought this phone for my wife who was complaining about the complexity of the Android ecosystem. Really, she couldn't care less about multiple apps or widgets or rooting her phone. She just wants Facebook status updates, a decent Contacts app in a form factor that is somewhat smaller than the recent spate of monster-sized Android phones. (As an aside, personally, I use either a Galaxy Note 2 or a Galaxy S4, both rooted - she wants nothing to do with all that). This phone fit the bill perfectly. After a bit of a learning curve, she fell into a routine with this phone. Call quality is great. The keyboard is spot-on perfect for her smaller hands. She loves this phone. Well, she loves it when it works, anyway. Lately, this phone has been powering off at strange times. Sometimes it requires a soft reset to bring it back. Other times, simply plugging it into the charger is enough to bring it back to life. After a quick trip through the Googles, I'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-air firmware update to resolve this problem. Thing is, that firmware update hasn't hit her phone yet. So...the waiting game. If your phone's OS is 8.0.10327.78, you are still waiting for the firmware update. Aside from this absolutely MAJOR issue with the phone's stability, its a wonderful flagship device for Windows Phone 8. Its really too bad that people don't give it a fair shake. Its not nearly as feature rich as a Droid, nor does it have as many apps as an iPhone. But there are just certain people out there who really...don't care about all that. They want the uncomplicated basics. Most of those people buy iPhones because family insists or have Androids foisted upon them by overeager Best Buy geeks. (nothing against the geeks - I am one) Those people should be looking at Windows Phone 8.

I wanted to have a mini keyboard to use this to type some notes, as it has Office and OneNote. Both Nokia and AT&T hide this little known fact that all keyboards are not supported with Bluetooth, as Microsoft deemed it not important I suppose. I talked with folks at Microsoft Store, and they told me that users are just suppose to browse or touch up documents, not really create new content on the phone. There are numerous other problems (I'm sure cited by other users), and the many applications one would expect to be commonplace, either don't exist or have really flawed implementations, such as having a lot of UX design flaws and huge missing functionality. The list is so huge, I could write a book. One that stood out is using e-mail: You have to configure a new application per email (yahoo, gmail, etc.) and so it isn't integrated into one app. Additionally, you can ONLY have one application per type of account, so if you had two Yahoo accounts (one for spam, one for friends, etc.) then you can only choose one of them. Thus the Yahoo email app only works with one Yahoo account. So while other systems allow you to browse all your e-mail through a single application, Microsoft forces you to use a single application per e-mail account, and only one of the same account. Essentially, Microsoft violates the path of least surprise (using what we know to work well), has poor implementation with major gaps that lack functionality, and poor user interface and experience to boot across the board, especially in e-mail.

I talked with folks at Microsoft Store, and they told me that users are just suppose to browse or touch up documents, not really create new content on the phone. There are numerous other problems (I'm sure cited by other users), and the many applications one would expect to be commonplace, either don't exist or have really flawed implementations, such as having a lot of UX design flaws and huge missing functionality. The list is so huge, I could write a book. One that stood out is using e-mail: You have to configure a new application per email (yahoo, gmail, etc.) and so it isn't integrated into one app. Additionally, you can ONLY have one application per type of account, so if you had two Yahoo accounts (one for spam, one for friends, etc.) then you can only choose one of them. Thus the Yahoo email app only works with one Yahoo account. And I should also note that the Yahoo sync is dysfunctional, it gets email sometime, and it cannot sync past emails. So while other systems allow you to browse all your e-mail through a single application, Microsoft forces you to use a single application per e-mail account, and only one of the same account. Essentially, Microsoft violates the path of least surprise (using what we know to work well), has poor implementation with major gaps that lack functionality, and poor user interface and experience to boot across the board, especially in e-mail. Combine this the fact that you cannot use bluetooth keyboards (or other HID devices like joysticks) despite advertising bluetooth is support (and how they all sort of hide the fact from users), this leaves a very distasteful experience...",4.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

19417,B07DDD8PNQ,R. Mahood,4,11-Sep-18,True,Great value phone,"Conclusion: Recommend as one of the better budget smartphones Purchased for non-tech spouse as replacement for fantastic but dated and limited Moto G. This Nokia is a very nice looking slim and thin unit. Dark blue and copper looks much richer than price. On to setup. Micro SIM from Moto didn't fit, so had to order nano SIM--no big deal but a day's delay. Two SIM slots are a bonus, but N/A for me. After charging, powered up, and initial setup for phone and Cricket network was intuitive, quick, and pretty much automatic. After logging into Google account, used Google phone transfer via Bluetooth which loaded most configurations and apps that were on old phone. Then, just a matter of app updates and additional personalization and the Nokia was on-line and ready. After a couple weeks' use, the transition has been practically painless. I installed a 16 Gb SD card and used the extend storage option, so total is 4x the amount the Moto G had, and our light usage didn't fill that one up. The Nokia is obviously much faster and there is no hint of performance lag with our pattern of use. Not into games or intensive graphics use. This phone does the basics well: phone and messages, browsing, email, and assorted personal interest apps. I researched phones a lot and this Nokia was the choice for slim size, adequate performance specs, features, and price. I read some of the common criticisms about the 3.1 model: e.g., no NFC, so-so camera, limited memory and storage. For someone who uses the advanced features of the flagship phones, certainly there is no comparison. This one fully meets our needs. The camera and display are better than the Moto and that was perfectly fine for us. It does not have hearing aid compatibility, but the ear-speaker volume is adequate. I am amused by so many folks I know and see who are obsessed with their $1000 iPhones and Samsungs using them for little more capability that we do with this $120 Nokia 3.1. But hey, they are keeping the economy going. If you want a good phone that has most of the current software and capabilities, this one is worth consideration. 4* rating",10.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DDD8PNQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AzNrwxkUL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DDD8PNQ,77,159.0,0.0

14156,B071ZDQ6MV,Rick313,5,11-Sep-17,True,Good value for the features and price!,"In general, I love the phone. I upgraded from a Moto X Pure Edition running Android 6, and the user experience on the Nokia 6 is very similar to what I was used to with the Moto X, but going from a quad-core to an octa-core processor provided a noticeable improvement in speed. The Moto X had been pretty sluggish for a while especially when updating apps from the Play store, but so far, the Nokia 6 has a very snappy user interface, and the Play store updates have been very quick as well. When I first setup the phone, it downloaded a couple of security updates, and I was pleased to see that the security patch level was for the current month. I received a couple of updates for the Moto X while I was using it, but they were usually delayed by a number of months, so I am hopeful that the Nokia 6 will do better in that regard, but only time will tell. Update: As of February 2018, I have received monthly security updates every month since I purchased the phone, and as a bonus, I received the upgrade to Android 8 (Oreo) last night. That level of ongoing support is something I have never experienced with any other phone. Way to go Nokia! I was pleased to see that the Nokia 6 does indeed come with NFC support. Prior to purchasing the phone, I had seen mixed reviews, some of them saying that NFC was included, and some of them saying that it was not, so I was not expecting to have it and was pleasantly surprised when I found that it was included. For me, one of the nice features that the Nokia 6 includes is an FM radio receiver which allows you to listen to FM radio stations without requiring a data connection because it can receive over the air FM broadcasts rather than streaming them over the internet. Unfortunately, the API used by most of the other FM tuner apps is not supported, so you're stuck using the buit-in FM Radio app. The default app works well enough. It allows you to perform an automated scan for stations, and it allows you to define favorite stations, but it does not provide any of the bells and whistles provided by some other FM tuner apps. I tried 3 other apps from the Play store, and none of them worked with the FM tuner on the Nokia 6, but despite that, it is still a nice feature to have that is not available on most Android phones. I have been using the phone on the AT&T network via Consumer Cellular; and the call quality, 4G data speeds, and battery life have been excellent. I have not had any issues with the phone. I have noticed that Android 7 seems to be a little more aggressive about killing background apps than previous versions of Android which can be a little frustrating at times, but that's an OS issue not the fault of the phone. I don't typically use the camera on my mobile phones, so I cannot speak to that, but overall I am very happy with the Nokia 6. The bottom line is that the Nokia 6 is a budget priced phone with a budget priced feature set, and for the price, it is a very good value. No, it cannot compete with the flagship phones of the world, but it was not designed for that. If you want a good quality phone for a reasonable price, then I highly recommend the Nokia 6.",37.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

I've been using the phone for about a month now with no issues. I mainly use the phone for web browsing, online storage, news, phone calls, notes, and photography. The phone is an Android Phone. It comes with no apps installed, except for the Google app collection and the Nokia Camera app. I went on to install the Microsoft Launcher, along with most of the Microsoft tools like OneDrive, Edge, and Outlook since I have a lot invested in the Microsoft universe. The display is excellent with great color and detail. Text is easy to read. You can adjust the display in many ways, such as adjusting the brightness, color template and so one. I personally prefer the display to not be too bright. The phone is able to adjust the display brightness according to the light levels. Seeing the display in the sun is no problem. The battery life is very good. I normally end the day with between 50 - 75 % of battery left. I don't use the phone for battery intensive things such as movie watching or action game playing. The phone comes with a fast charger. It takes about 2 hours to recharge from 25% to full. The fit and finish is excellent. The camera lenses are protected by the back glass surface. There is no camera bump, the back is smooth. The phone is thinner that I expected, with a metal edging. It looks and feels very nice. The fingerprint scanner works fine. It unlocks on the first try most of the time. The only exception is when I try to use it after having taken a shower. My guess is having water logged hands changes how the fingerprint looks when pressed up against the scanner. The software has been stable. The phone receives updates from Google and the app store quickly. Being an Android One phone guarantees security updates for at least 3 years after the phone has been released. You certainly want to purchase a phone holster or phone case as the phone is very slippery. Ironically, the phone slipped out of my coat pocket onto the pavement while I was shopping for a phone holster. It did not break, but was blemished.

13973,B071ZDQ6MV,Jonathan J Chadwick,5,11-Jul-17,True,Nokia 6 Silver add-less version,Update 7/14/17: The issues I was experiencing on 7/12 were resolved after doing a master reset of the device. The Nokia Launcher3 that runs the homescreen was corrupt after the 7.1.1 update. Now all of my widgets in the widget drawer are there and after restarting the phone continue to be available. I think the network issue was also caused by an outdated carrier setting file that was redownloaded after the factory wipe. The phone is now performing flawlessly and is a really great piece of hardware. I don't have any screen coloring issues like a couple other reviewers have had and the processor seems to be keeping up just fine for my lite daily usage. I'm not a heavy gamer but I could see graphic intensive games possibly slowing the processor. I'll download some games to play and see what happens. Bumping my overall score back up to a 5 since my issues have been resolved. Update 7/12/17: I received the push update to 7.1.1 yesterday. I like how quickly Nokia/HMD is pushing updates to these devices compared to other manufacturers. But I'm now running into my first issue. The default Nokia clock widget has disappeared as well as the google now search widget. I cannot for the life of me get these back. I downloaded another clock widget and after restarting the app is still in the app drawer but the widget as also disappeared and is nowhere to be found in the widget drawer. Issue #2 today: I get to work after having no issues getting on to AT&T LTE and today it is only connecting to AT&T H+ (4G lite) after restarting still only connecting to that network. Will most likely be doing a master wipe when I get home and see if that resolves my issues. If not I'll be contacting Amazon for a replacement. Fingers crossed it just needs a software wipe. If anyone else is experiencing same issues please comment! I'm dropping my review by 1 star until this is resolved. I received my Nokia 6 yesterday on launch day. I purchased the silver without adds for $229. Initial impressions are the phone is gorgeous and build quality is excellent. Reminds me of the quality of my Nokia E71 of years past. The screen is almost bezelless on the sides which is nice. The colors and pixel density are excellent. The stock android is a welcome experience and is very snappy and responsive. I read where people were concerned with the 430 processor Nokia decided to use in this device and so far it seems like it will keep up just fine with my needs. One thing I found interesting is even this US version can be dual SIM which is rare to have in our country. It has a nano SIM slot and a combo micro SD or another nano SIM can be placed in the tray. This is a nice feature if you are wanting to combine maybe your business and personal phone but want to keep separate numbers. Camera seems fine but I haven't had much experience yet using it outdoors so I may update the review after further testing. Overall I can't believe something that is priced sub $250 can have this quality and feel. I remember phones of this price range a few years ago feeling like they came out of a cracker Jack box. If you're looking for something new I'd give this one a shot especially since it's sold via Amazon so shipping will be quick and returns I'd necessary easy.,119.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

14136,B071ZDQ6MV,Marcus,3,11-Jul-17,True,Nokia 6...not impressed.,"I've only had this phone one day, but I can say..for me..it does not match it's hype! My previous/current phone is a BLU Studio Energy 2. I was moving to this because the BLU has a built into it's software PUP (look it up please) that's not considered malware..but should be! The only way you can uninstall it is to root the phone...and this phone...does not root easily..I've been trying. On to why 3 stars..they talk about the display quality on the Nokia 6...I sent a photo to both phones via gmail and opened them. The one on the BLU was better pixel wise and color wise. (the photo was of me on vacation, and I know how the colors should have looked). They talked about dolby sound on the Nokia 6. The Blu has a single speaker on the rear of the phone and the Nokia has two really small speakers on the bottom. I opened sound cloud on both via wifi..played the same song..and the nokia was barely louder and a tad clearer...was not impressed. There are no indication lights on the nokia..charging..completed charging..phone message...nada...my fault for assuming it would. The Blu does have indication lights that can be turned on or off. The camera on the Nokia is a little better, but not by much. Understand..the BLU is my first android phone. I've been a Nokia user for years. From when they had their own OS, to when they went to windows. My older Nokia has a better camera than either the BLU or the new Nokia. The Nokia does look and feel premium more like a flag ship phone, where the BLU feels and looks like a mid range phone, but I'll take function over form any day. I can't comment on phone reception quality because I'm waiting on a nano sim card for the Nokia. I will update after I get the sim. But for now...this Nokia 6 has not impressed me.",1.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

2365,B00CQAODG4,Mae Day,4,11-Jul-13,False,Lots of good qualities!,"This is my first smartphone in about 3 years. I was nervous at first, because I've always had Android and have never had a Windows phone. When I got it activated, I started playing with it and found out that it's very easy to use. I was able to figure out the apps, settings and all the other features in about 30 or so minutes. The touchscreen works great! I was able to easily slide screens and easily touch where I wanted to go. The camera is amazing! It takes wonderful pictures! I can capture a shot, use the flash and there's even a neat feature where you can take multiple shots and choose which one to save. The pictures are crisp and clear. You don't have to be a photographer to take great pictures with this phone. The video feature is also very nice. It's fast to get to and you're recording within a few taps! The battery lasts me for almost a whole day. A day for me is 7 or 8am to around 9 pm or a little later. Of course, depending on your usage, you might have to charge it a little more than I do. Now my cons, but there's not many. The biggie for me was the apps. You can't get many of the popular apps like you can with other systems. I was disappointed when I went to download a few that I hear about from friends and I can't get them. Another thing for me was no space for a memory card. I would have loved to have a spot for a card so I could have my older pictures from my other phone. Plus, it's nice to have pictures on a memory card to easily get pictures printed out by a kiosk.

2410,B00CS2ZWKQ,Louis,5,11-Jan-15,True,Super phone - gorgeous inside and out!,"This phone is fantastic! I bought the Lumia 920 for my daughter for her first phone. I ended up hogging it from her! When my iPhone 4S had an issue, I quickly found the Lumia 925 and ordered it. I could not be more pleased with my overall experience with the phone. I've had it for over a week and haven't had an ounce of buyer's remorse. Pros: - Smooth interface - Customizable look and feel - Superlative camera and camera apps - Great integration with various social networks - Apps... Yes Apps. The one thing that you always hear is that Windows Phones do not have apps. They do. Everything that I had on my iPhone I now have on my Windows Phone or a something similar. - I love the high contrast background that is uniform between apps and menus. - It's different! You do not see a lot of 925's in America, so the phone stands out and makes a statement. It has a style. Cons: - Cortana is in beta, but is still awesome - The back cover is very slick, so it always feels like I'm going to drop it. I just bought a case. Problem Solved. - I did like the Home button voice dial feature on the iPhone, which the 925 does not have. It takes a few more steps to launch Cortana which makes calling tricky when driving. But Cortana has very good speech pattern recognition. I would highly recommend the Nokia Lumia 920 and 925. The 920 is built like a tank, while the 925 is more like a sports car, and I love both of them. The 920 is perfect for my daughter who, as a teenager, will be more prone to dropping it, while the 925 has a more corporate look. Attached are some picture that I have taken with the 925.

1472,B00A2V7BA4,NZ Expat,5,11-Jan-13,False,Hardest Decision was to move from iPhone but will never look back,"I have been an avid iPhone user for the past 3 years, and since I moved from my blackberry to the iPhone I have absolutely sweared by them. In that time I have built up a library of apps, added an iPad to my tools and have never even thought of moving platform. The hardest decision was to move to another platform and to start the daunting task of moving my contacts over, losing all my apps and setting up a new phone for all my accounts. But when I saw the Nokia 920 I wanted it. It should be noted the size and weight is not something I care about in a phone at all and going into the purchase aside fromt he forementioned 'changing platform annoyances' that was the only thing I was really worried about. Too my releif the setup of the new phone took less than 30 minutes. A simple bluetooth transfer of all my contacts from my iPhone, an install of the phone manager and the upload of all my playlists from iTunes was a breeze and straight forward. Using the phone is intuative, and the OS really pops on the screen which is amazing. I had never really thought about how bored I had got with the same old apple interface and how much fun a new one is to play around with. The nokia apps are excellent, and I find myself using Nokias maps and augmented reality app daily for new food spots around me (I live in Shanghai and as a foreigner there are some Gems you just wouldnt find otherwise). The battery life is great, wireless charging is just plane cool and apps are being added every day (although the app store is missing some of my favourites). There are 2 main things I have notice since using this phone 1) I find myself using apps less 2) With the bigger screen i find myself using my phone for emailing more than my iPad. I highly recommend this phone to anyone bored of the iPhone interface (the iPhone 5 is an exellent phone however) and to anyone that wants an excellent camera with them all the time. My biggets fear was moving form iPhone, but it turned out to be much much easier than I thoguht it would be, so dont let that deter you.",5.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0
4907,B00O15MWOM,no name,4,11-Feb-15,True,Solid Smartphone at an Affordable Price,"This phone has many good aspects, and in general I like it. But in spite of everything good about this phone, I feel that its overall performance suffers due to its unique OS --- Windows Phone. I'll talk about this in more detail later in my review. It is my opinion that this provides tremendous value and fair performance at a fantastic price. Without any further ado, let's look at the Nokia Lumia 530 in detail. DESIGN / SCREEN The design of this phone is rather unique. It sits well in the hand, and is easy to use with one hand. Its plastic back cover feels solid and looks great. But one issue with the materials still puzzles me. For some reason, the plastic back is absurdly slippery. I don't understand why the designer chose to use such a slippery type plastic. Be warned --- you will have to purchase a case for this phone or you will probably end up dropping it. Also, this phone is not thin --- it has some heft to it, but that does not bother me. I liked the overall design of the phone, but felt that the materials composing the design were poorly chosen. The screen resolution on the phone is surprisingly good for a phone in this price range. Colors are reasonably accurate, and text is clear. If you were to zoom in on the screen, you would definitely notice fuzziness. But the screen looks great for daily use. Unless you are familiar with having a flagship level phone, you will be satisfied with the screen on the Nokia Lumia 630. CAMERA The camera is, by far, the weakest point on this phone. Pictures are noisy and blurry unless taken under ideal conditions. But I feel that this is more or less a case of "" You get what you pay for."" Based upon how I use my phone, the camera isn't a very important feature to me. But if you place considerable importance on having a good camera phone, I could not honestly recommend this camera to you. If, on the other hand, you just want a camera to take an occasional photo, you should be fine with the Nokia Lumia 530's camera. PERFORMANCE / OPERATING SYSTEM Based upon my experience with this phone, its performance is good. Apps usually open quickly, and you usually won't detect much lag while browsing the web or watching a video. But I can't help but feel that Windows OS hurts the performance of this phone. Many times, the design of the phone's OS forces the phone to work way harder than is really necessary to achieve its tasks. The OS is somewhat complicated and downright confusing at times. Of course, this is more or less an issue of personal preference. If you have used Windows Phone OS before, then you will unquestionably love the Nokia Lumia 530. But if you are moving to this phone from Android OS or iOS, understand that familiarizing yourself with Windows OS will be an experience. I used Pure Android right before using this phone, and learning a new OS was a time consuming process for me. I don't mean to sound negative, but I want to make sure that you understand the significant impact Windows Phone OS could have on your opinion of this phone. VALUE I think this phone is a clear winner in this category. It manages to be pretty much everything you NEED in a smartphone. Call quality is good, messages send quickly, the internet is easy to access, and the navigational systems work well. I love reviewing what many people refer to as ""budget smartphones"" because it is simply amazing to see how much value can be placed in a phone for an affordable price. And in my opinion, the Nokia Lumia 530 provides tremendous value due to its solid performance, design, and low price tag. My final verdict on this phone is definitely positive. Windows produced a solid phone at an almost unbeatable price. As long as you understand that the OS is going to take a little bit of time to get used to, I'd say go for it. Thumbs up to Amazon and Nokia!!!",9.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 530 White - No Contract (T-Mobile),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-530-White-Contract/dp/B00O15MWOM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ba7gOGt5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00O15MWOM,378,133.28,0.0
1753,B00A2V7BA4,Msquared,1,11-Feb-13,False,Not happy!,"I am not happy with the Nokia 920. I have owned it for three months. I bought it because it was supposed to have the best camera. Yes it has a Zeiss lens. But the camera is HORRIBLE! It opens up to a wide angle , as do most digital cameras, with no option to change that distortion. The color balance it way off into the blue purple range. Of course I can correct the color balance but I can't correct the distortion. It takes too long to process an image so the camera is useless for people or anything that moves. If you subject is complicated it can take up to 10 seconds for the camera to decide to focus and shoot, again way tooo long. The phone reviews boast that you can use the camera with out turning on the phone, but the button is hard to press and takes 7 seconds to open, too long , a missed shot. The photos app , to view your photos, be it ones that you took with the camera, ones from sky drive, or ones that you down loaded has a bug. When you access this app the images , and menu appears scrambled. It takes two or three attempts to get this app to function. I have to tried to contact Nokia many times, they just send me a no -reply email. The phone is heavy, and larger in dimensions then most, I'm told that is because of the camera. This presents a problem fitting it into pockets, and a problem with car mounts described below. The battery life is HORRILBE, if you are using the phone it's a max four hours, even though the phone will tell you 18 hours left! The only way to get decent battery life is to turn EVERYTHING down. That is the brightness of the screen, the screen time to thirty seconds, etc, etc, GPS, even off line, eats up the battery completely, so you have to run it on a charger. Even in the longest screen time, it is a pain to keep on turning on the screen so that you can see a map while you are driving. GPS is in Beta stage, still with mistakes and not as easy to use as a Garmin or Tom-tom ( we own both.) In my case I could not find a car phone mount that was compatible with the phone and my car a sante fe hundai. Due to the weight of the phone the phone falls off of the window. It is also big enough to cause a considerable blind spot. If I placed the phone jack to left of the wheel, the power cord ( it need to be on the charger) interferes with the wheel. No jack stuck to the dash board successfully. This situation makes it impossible to see a gps or answer a phone for a quick "" I will call you back "" as the phone has to sit in a cup holder. Music quality of the phone is flat and Tinny. I do not play any games so I can't comment . There ARE a decent amount of APPs available for the phone, although I have been disappointed with all that I've paid for. The trial is not a trial just a description and then the app offers nothing , so I have to do a web search. Most of the free apps have been decent. (BTW although I am a paid subscriber to WSJ their app is only video content, not their news paper.) This phone is sold exclusively thought ATT. The people in the store know nothing about the phone, including how to use it or how to set it up. Right out the door they set the phone up to be located in Turkmenistan( !!) , not USA and I could not find the right settings window to change it. This wrong setting caused and error message when I tried to down load any APP saying I was in the wrong region ( I am located in the Seattle and I was in the wrong region to load the Seattle Times! Oy! !! ) The people at a ""Windows store"" helped. Dealing with ATT is excruciating. Don't listen to ATT false advertising, tremendous amount of call drop. As I live in Seattle (think Microsoft) many of the potential customers in the ATT store were jazzed about the phone and the online reviews mis-lead me to think this was the best product for my needs. On the up side the windows tiles are great. Also as I am a MSN customer, the link to Outlook is helpful.",9.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

20499,B07HD3QC65,M. Dillon,1,11-Dec-18,True,It was great until the software update.,"The phone shipped with Android Oreo (version 8) and it was GREAT! (five stars!) I have T-Mobile in the USA and I took it over to Europe and everything was wonderful. At the end of November, the Android Pie upgrade (version 9) was pushed to the phone by Nokia. Android itself was fine - the problem now is how the phone refuses to connect reliably to the mobile network. I do not mean problems with data... I mean I’m walking around half the time with it saying “emergency calls only”. I tried new SIM cards and nothing helped.

15468,B075FLG6MV,Max Power,4,11-Dec-17,True,"Great phone for the price! Stock Android with continued updates, Dual SIM, SD card slot...","This is a great cheap smartphone for under $100. Sure it is not very good in the spec department but depending on what you are looking for it might be the right choice. As mentioned earlier the specs are nothing special. It is definitely the weakest part of this phone. From personal experience the performance feels like on par with a Samsung Galaxy S5 or an iPhone 5s. If you are someone who always gets the latest phone, you will be disappointed. I'll highlight a couple positive things that this phone does well. This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't use any demanding apps. Forget about most games. Don't worry though because calls, texts, email, and chatting work perfectly. I see it as the best communication device under $100. I'm using this device as a back up/travel phone. I currently have an AT&T and a T-Mobile SIM in the dual slots. The phone can switch between them on the fly. You can route calls and data between the two SIMs automatically or manually choose it each time you place a call. Most dual SIM phones I've used don't handle it this seamlessly or they make you switch one line off before switching to the other one. The status bar shows the signal strength of each line and also the type of connection (LTE, 4G, 3G, etc...). Keep in mind that each frequency of the radio can only be used once. This means if the 4G connection for each SIM you have uses the same frequency, then SIM #1 will get the priority and #2 will fall back to the next available. The Nokia 2 really shines in the dual SIM functionality. The processor used in this phone is the snapdragon 212. It does not use much power since it is not very high performing. This combined with the huge battery (4000mAh) means you really do get great battery life. I have the brightness set to the max, wifi and bt on, two SIMs, after a day of use (7am-7pm) I still have 75% battery left. This is on track to get me two days of standby, you could probably stretch it if you power down over night or go into battery saver modes. One neutral point of this phone is the storage space. It is only 8GB with about half of that available after the OS is considered, since it has expandable storage I didn't make this a negative. A microSD card is a must with this phone. Get a decent SD card and combine it with the internal storage. The phone isn't that fast so you won't really notice much performance difference between launching apps off the internal memory vs the sd card. Don't get this phone to play games, fly your drone, or for the camera. Get this if you need the connectivity of dual SIMs and the long battery life. EDIT: I also forgot to mention that Nokia has promised continued support for Android 8 and 9 for their new phones that were released this year, the Nokia 2 was included in this announcement as well.",112.0,Nokia,"Nokia 2 - Android - 8GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5"" Screen - Black - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B075FLG6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-rum+PvIL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075FLG6MV,359,194.97,0.0

The phone is simply great. It is easy to use, with lots of features, and well built. Good Nokia quality as expected. I have always been a fan of Nokia phones and the Nokia /Microsoft combination is perfect. The touch screen is becoming easier each time. The phone is indeed unlocked and I did take it to my initial cell provider. However,I was not pleased with the speed offered by them and had to switch to another provider - Digicel in the Caribbean is now my new cell provider. What a difference and the 4G LTE speed is simply amazing. Very pleased in all areas, and the phone did not let me down. Additional update to follow if necessary as I use the phone. UPDATE 20 Dec 12: Please note that the seller of my Nokia Lumia 900 unlocked cell phone was Masterdeals. My cell was indeed unlocked and I was able to communicate with them. Still very pleased with the Nokia Lumia 900 ! UPDATE 14 SEPT 13: This phone is still working very well. I have never had an issue with it, and I will say over and over again, ""I really like my phone"". Its fast ( good provider ), and I even read books on my phone. Its like my mini PC with easy use of the Microsoft office. I have also dropped it many times, but fortunately it was well protected. Lots of apps, and I am able to track my morning run/walk without a glitch. Unfortunately windows phones are missing the app for Magic Jack, and that is the only important app that I am lacking. Waiting on Magic jack to create an app for Windows phones ! Love the live tiles, and like that I can organize them how I want them - reminds me of my desktop.

Where to begin? 1) Loaded with bloatware that cannot be removed, or even hidden. Apparently Nokia doesn't understand their market for this device. If I'd wanted a ""smart"" phone with social media apps, games, web browsers and the like, I'd have bought one. 2) Doesn't work as the manual states. According to the manual: to make a call, enter the desired number and press the call button. Nope, that sequence attempts to create a new contact entry. Perhaps if I create a new contact for every single number that I ever call, it'll work as advertised. Not likely. 3) Vibrates on connect. Some bright spark decided that the phone should vibrate when the called party picks up. This ""feature"" cannot be disabled. 4) Horrible ringtones. All the supplied ringtones are annoying little melodies. I suppose that'll encourage me to answer quickly, since I'd be embarrassed to have anyone hear this thing ring.

2237,B00CQAODG4,BW543,5,10-Sep-13,True,Best phone I've had by far!,"I've had an IPhone and most recently I had a Samsung phone so I was looking forward to checking out what this Nokia Windows phone had to offer. I've owned this phone for a little over a month and so far I am impressed with the overall package. The Windows OS was VERY easy to learn. Took me about 30mins just playing around with the phone to be fully confident that I could preform any task that I needed to with the phone. I was also surprised to find that pretty much all of the Apps that I used were available on the Windows App Store (I went the Windows App Store website to check). The only exception was my bank which turned out to not be a problem because I just Pinned a Tile (placed a shortcut) of the bank's website to my home page. App problem solved! What I was most excited about and also most concerned about with a Windows phone were the Live Tiles. For things like the weather, stock, and even the dictionary.com word of the day, information just pops up without having to open an App to see it. This works beautifully and most Apps have an option to use the Live Tiles in someway or another. I thought that with all my Apps updating live my battery would die quick and my 1GB data limit would be used up even quicker but I found that I could control if I wanted an App to update and I could also control the frequency so I haven't had a problem at all with either the battery life or with excessive carrier data usage (btw I haven't gone over my data limit yet because I download the major stuff via Wifi and use it while I'm out) Now as for the device, Nokia did a wonderful job creating this phone. Things I liked (LOVED). 1. Offline turn by turn navigation- Nokia HERE maps and HERE drive (don't know HOW it works but I've set my phone to airplane mode and used the GPS many times already. Mainly to see if it would work as advertised...Needless to say, the Nokia passed with flying colors). 2. Offline streaming radio playlists. So I love listening to music but I take trains where I don't have service so Nokia's Music App let's me download either a pre-made or created playlist to my phone for FREE so I can listen to music even without service. 3. Wireless charging! 4. The photos are awesome; especially for low light. 5. I've already dropped this phone about 6 times now without a case and it still doesn't have a scratch. What I dislike about the phone 1. The look of the calendar, I wish that the stock calendar App had slightly bigger font for the month view like the Apps you can get from the Windows App store. 2. Wish that I could download my voicemail messages without get charged a monthly fee. (I think that's a Verizon thing) 3. The media volume should be separated from the ringer volume. But I hear that is being updated shortly. All in all I love this Nokia phone.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

And I hear if I get MS Office 365 I can update my word and excel files on my phone and then access those updated files on my computer. -I was also surprised that even though I had to create a Live.com account, I was still able to sync my Google information. I'm currently using Gmail which synced perfectly, got my Google contacts in seconds and my Google calendar syncs just as fast as I can input the data. -The phone has a nice quality weight and a very sleek design. -The camera quality exceeded my expectations especially for capturing objects or people in motion without the photo coming out blurry. -I don't feel like I need a case for it to protect it. I'll probably get one for style later on though. -Now I'm spoiled with the wireless charging.

20538,B07HD3QC65,Fred Y,4,10-Nov-19,True,All of the cost went into the screen and build-quality,"Don't get me wrong, this is a really great phone for the cost, and if you're not a super heavy user of your devices, this is a great mid-tier phone to have. The major problem is, as I said in my title, the only part of this phone that really got any attention to detail was the screen and the build quality. the screen's brightness and Fidelity are fantastic, and the same thing can be said about how the phone feels and looks in your hand. It is incredibly slippery, I will admit, and I've had to buy a case for it out of necessity. The microphones are pretty bad, the headphone jack is almost completely useless, the headphones that came with the phone you could basically just throw those away and don't bother about them, the speaker(s?) built-in are okay but not great, and that about sums it up. Everything aside from the screen and the case are absolutely mediocre at best, and pretty awful at worst. Using Bluetooth for your car audio and for headphones is highly recommended it you value decent audio in any capacity, as it is by and far vastly superior to the headphone jack. Overall, the fact that I'm not tied to a contract with it, and I could pay it out right in like one go fairly easily, makes up for the fact that a lot of those things are holding back the phone significantly. The fact that this has essentially stock Android is it's saving grace, and the 636 Snapdragon inside of it is adequate enough for this price range for you to be satisfied with performance across the board. If the other phones from Nokia are this unbalanced, then I would recommend staying clear of them until they get some of those issues addressed, and maybe go for Xiaomi for a better balance, although they don't provide NFC for most of their phones, which the Nokia 7.1 does have, so that may be a deal breaker for some.",1.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

20528,B07HD3QC65,Sam,2,10-Mar-19,True,First screen broke without dropping it,"So far, not super happy with the Nokia 7.1. I bought it 2 weeks ago and I was sitting at the dining room table and turned my screen on and noticed a crack on the lower 1/2 of the screen (going from the right side about 1.5"" from the bottom down to the middle of bottom). I had it in the official Nokia case the whole time and it had never been dropped or sat on. The only ""stress"" it could have had was being put in a phone mount, but that should not cause enough pressure to crack a screen. I have never cracked a screen with any phone I have had before this, so this was a huge letdown. My husband has the same phone but in a slightly thicker case so I am buying that case now. Thankfully, I was able to exchange it and we will see how the next one is and I will update my review. In terms of other aspects of the phone, I was only able to play around with it for a little bit. I do absolutely love the camera. It takes the best pictures out of any smartphone I have ever had. It has a bunch of modes for both photos and videos. My favorites are the depth photos and slow motion videos. I had the Microsoft launcher on it to be able to customize more to my liking in terms of icon size because the standard size icons look tiny on this screen. You can change icon size but not number per row in standard Android (at least as far as I know.) The phone is also just generally very pretty (minus the notch- but I ""hid"" it in settings.) However, there is no notification LED. Every smartphone I have had in the last 5+ years has had one and I didn't even think that I had to look to see if this one had one. It has been a bummer because I do not like ambient display mode as I always try to interact with the phone in that mode and you cannot without unlocking the phone. And I really like to have my phone ringtone on silent (with my message notification on low) and I rely on the notification light a lot. I also came from the Axon 7 and I was able to customize the levels for both the ringtone and notification tone loudness, so I was also disappointed that stock Android no longer lets you do that. There are hacks like having a silent ringtone or downloading an app, but that is just extra steps. All in all, for the price it is a pretty solid phone and certainly worth the $300 price tag, even with the specific issues I had, but I do think that the glass screen is just too fragile.",3.0,Nokia,"Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84"" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07HD3QC65,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uRnzVNj9L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HD3QC65,484,209.0,0.0

3610,B00HWEMZ1E,Mike A.,5,10-Mar-14,False,I left Android and I am happy!,"I have an iPhone 4S from work which is more of a paper weight and I just turned in my Droid RAZR. I loved my RAZR until Jelly Been made it slow. I have a Samsung Note 3 and 8 at work for a pilot and as well as iPad mini and Air so I am invloved with all of them. The Apple products are well built and run well but to me are just boring and I do not see the value of paying the extra cost. The Samsung devices are built cheaply and have a ton of useless apps but they do run smooth and offer a lot of more features over the Apple products. I love my kids and take a ton of pictures. I have a Nikon DSLR but I don't always want to carry it obviously. I tested the Note 3 and I have the iPhone 4S and the Icon camera is far better. It is quick and the I have only had one out of focus picture while my son and I where ice skating so both of us where in motion. The camera button makes it easy to take those kind of pictures and I have not had any issues with pressing that button and getting a clear picture. I am not an app junky and every app that I had on my Droid RAZR is on the Icon. I do miss the ""Desk Mode"" of the RAZR which presented me a nice clock and access to my important features while in the dock, but with how fast the Icon is, it takes no time to get into the home screen which is basically the same. I read some ""professional"" review that said they would not buy it for the lack of a notification center? The whole home screen is a notification center! I also have a banner that alerts me of a notification so I am not sure what they are talking about. The colors on the display are amazing. I do not have an iPhone 5S to compare and it is not fair to compare to the 4S but I would say it is equal to if not better than the Note 3.

15430,B075FL4H89,Dwayne Brent Charles,5,10-Jun-19,True,The best Phone-phone you can get,"Are you tired of smartphones? Well, this one is a fantastic compromise. Mind you, it's a pricey thing, as it's a novelty product after all, but all the things it does, it does great: by being just a phone and nothing more. --System UI--- If you're like me, and are only familiar with Windows Phone, Android and Nokia's old Symbian OS, the new user interface would take a bit of time getting used to. It's not because it's difficult to use, it's a really simple interface designed to be user friendly. Rather, it's because I had to adjust to the interface because of how relatively simple it is. Anything that's important to the practicality of a phone is provided to you in as few clicks as possible, and that's pretty awesome. WARNING, there's no Wifi. --Battery Life---- It's great. It's really great. You wouldn't have to charge this phone for upwards of a week. I really missed that. With heavy usage, it obviously goes down, but being such a simple phone, heavy usage is likely not going to be a thing. ---For those of you buying this for Nostalgia feelings--- This phone isn't going to cut it for you. The changes to the software and features, as well as the size and make of the phone (it's so thin and light) is not going to activate any kind of nostalgia you had for the original save for wondering why phones can't go back to buttons anymore. To sum up, the phone is strong, the screen vibrant and decently lit, the battery life is fantastic and you don't have to worry about bugs, being constantly connected to online noise (social networks and otherwise) or malware.

I guess I've been unlucky with this phone. I bought 2 White versions at a local Verizon store and had to returned them with a problem with the capacity buttons. The first one had all the Capacity buttons white but the Windows Buttons had something inside like glue ( looks horrible when the light lit). The term that people are using on the internet is a (Goopy) button. Now to the 2 phones I've receive through Amazon (black version). I was hoping it was a problem with the White version but so far I got 2 phones (black version) with Amazon and they have the same issue. The capacity key on the 2 phones from Amazon are Yellow and I'm pretty sure they are suppose to be white. The first one that I got from the Verizon store were Pure White. I really love the phone but now I have to wait until they get them in stock again and hope that it doesn't have the same issue. I wish i could upload photos so people would understand how ugly it looks when the Capacity button light is on.,3.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

14055,B071ZDQ6MV,James,3,10-Jul-17,True,"Buy this phone for the clean, up to date software","***Update 7/31/17 Updating my rating to 3 stars. I'm noticing more and more that the call quality isn't very good and there seems to be some bugs with call audio. My phone cuts out a lot while driving, to the point where I have to ask the person I'm speaking with to repeat themselves several times. I take the same route to work every day and I've never had any issue with any other phone. Also, the volume of the speaker phone is VERY low. It's not that the speaker volume is low, as that gets extremely loud when listening to music or watching video. It's only in the phone app. I've had several people tell me they hear a bad echo when I use the speaker phone. What's worse, when switching between speaker phone and the ear piece speaker, the audio seems to completely cut out. I'm tempted to give this phone 2 as making phone calls is basic functionality. Maybe I have a defective unit but I'm returning the phone for a refund. ***Update 7/29/17 received new phone. Screen in replacement phone is much better. Still very slight yellow tint at bottom of display but barely noticeable. Updating to 4 stars. ***Update 7/15/17 I've updated my review slightly to reflect my week with the phone. Overall rating still stands. If my replacement screen has no defects I'll increase my rating. ***Update 7/11/17 I've received a few system updates so far - props to Nokia for caring about the software experience. I forgot to mention, I'm on T-mobile in the US. My signal has been great (full signal, lte) here at work today. I'll update this review if it's any better at home. I requested a new unit and if the display is fixed I will update to a 4 star review. Summary: Buy this phone over other budget phones for a clean, pure android experience that looks like it will be kept up to date with timely updates. What are you giving up from more expensive phones? Mostly the camera quality and processing power. I've used a lot of phones in the past few years, most of them higher end android phones but I've also used several budget phones including the moto e, g, and older nokia windows phones. My last phone was a nexus 6p which I bought for ~ $420 new about a year and a half ago. My comparison will be with the nexus 6p but also with my experience with all phones I've used (budget, high end, etc..) I purchased the Nokia 6 without ads which may perform different than the version with prime ads. Pros: - Build quality is incredible. Better than my nexus 6p (which would probably break in half if I tried hard enough). This device just feels solid. - Android software. Pure android - bloat free! Not one unnecessary app installed on the phone (If you use all the google apps, I do). I'm coming from a stock android phone and the software experience on the nokia is identical. I've never used a pixel phone but I believe the launcher is very similar. The phone comes running android 7.1.1 w/ April security update (update: now on June security update). Pretty great at this price point and from what I've heard Nokia intends to keep this phone up to date and quickly. This was actually the main reason I chose this phone over others were more powerful hardware at the same price point. Most budget phones get one major update and are abandoned because of their price point. - Speaker sounds good and gets fairly loud. It's bottom firing and supposedly stereo...it's a cell phone speaker. - VOLTE and Wifi calling appear to be working on t-mobile. I haven't done enough testing to say with 100% certainty though. - Screen is good. No complaints at this price point (although mine has yellow splotches which I'm hoping is just a defect - see pictures). It does lean towards a cooler temperature but again it's much better than some budget phones I've used. Cons: - Cameras are probably the biggest corner that was cut. If you're not coming from an older, more expensive phone you will most likely be happy with them. The front camera in particular is especially bad if you're coming from an older higher end phone. Video chat is extremely dark unless you are in very good lighting and the focus is very soft. I've only taken a few pictures with the rear camera but it seems good enough for the price. If you're coming from an older budget phone, the cameras are fine. - Power and volume buttons. These are just bad buttons at any price point. They are very hard to push and it's hard to know what you're hitting without looking (volume down vs power...). They don't stick out enough from the body of the phone and are too close together. It sounds like nitpicking but I use the power and volume rocker often. They are metal so points for quality. Also, the power button is immediately below the volume rocker so it makes taking screenshots difficult (volume down + power button). - Signal strength / reception seems weak compared to my nexus 6p. My nexus 6p would always use lte at my house and the nokia is constantly at very low lte signal and switching to 3g. I'll look more into the apn settings but they seemed to be correct. ***Update - I have received several software updates since I received the phone, however there is still some issues with reception. At home, my signal will sometimes go out entirely and will switch to 3g. I'm not sure what nokias 3g symbol means...maybe hspa+? Also, while driving my call audio will become garbled for a second. This hasn't happened with any of my other phones. It's not horrible or a deal breaker, but if you live in an area where your reception is already very bad, you may want to look into other options. - Screen defect. There is yellow splotching / tint at the bottom of the screen. I'm hoping a replacement will take care of this and it's not just a cheaper display. It's subtle but annoying once you notice it (see pictures). I will update review once I receive replacement. - No notifications while the screen is off that I have found. I.E. there is nothing that indicates you received a new call, text, etc.. while the screen is off. An led light would have been helpful. Other: USB Port - it is micro usb even though that's not really specified in the amazon description. I was hoping for usb c but some people might prefer micro usb. - Speed is okay. I didn't expect this game to play the latest 3d games ( I don't game on my phone ) and it does general tasks like email, text, and calling very well. Multitasking / switching between apps is also speedy. However, web browsing was a little choppy. If you aren't coming from a higher end phone you probably won't notice it and you'll be perfectly happy with it. I haven't run it through a full battery cycle yet but based on my usage so far I'm guessing it will get about 3 hours of SOT without tweaking any settings. ***Update, battery life is great for me and always lasts me a full day. I don't use any battery optimization settings and can get ~ 4 hours SOT in a day. I usually have 20-30% battery left at the end of the day. Overall, I think nokia cut the right corners to get to this price point, although I wish they used a slightly better front facing camera. I think the pure android experience and incredible build quality set this budget phone apart from the rest and that's the reason I went with this phone over any of the other amazon prime phones. However, you can get a used higher end phone for the same price (~$230) that will be better in almost every way. If you want a new phone with a warranty, clean software, will most likely get updates, and don't need the best photos - I highly recommend this phone.",176.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0

I get the phone, follow the instructions to put in the SIM card and turn it on, it tells me ""invalid or no SIM card"" and will not get cell signal. I call ATT. They say ""oh, you didn't put the SIM in and turn it on, did you?"" I said yes, I followed your instructions. They tell me no, you have to call us now and activate or it ""fries"" the sim card. I think what really happens is their new anti-theft database does not have the phone's serial number in it and it's black listed.

2493,B00E45043A,Isma'il,5,10-Jan-14,True,Great smartphone at a low price that just works!!,"A few words before I begin: I USED to be an Android user and I've tried an iPhone but didn't ""feel the love"" there either. About 2.5 years ago, I got hired by a firm that issued me my first Windows Phone; I had no choice in the matter. I was a die-hard Android fan and was displeased at the prospect of giving up my ""preferred"" platform......until I sat down and actually USED it. I got this phone as my personal device the other day and it's been a gem like the other 2 Windows Phones I've had. So what if it doesn't have a 100-megapixel camera, 32-core processor, 64 GB of RAM, etc....my point is that Windows Phone doesn't NEED all that hardware to run properly (except for the camera if your only camera is your phone, but you can get a better camera with other Nokia models ;)). Windows Phone doesn't come with TouchWhizz, MotoBlunder, HTC NonSense or any of that other bloatware, and runs very well without that stuff bogging it down like it does with most Android devices. Windows Phone isn't twitchy, touchy or glitchy like Android and doesn't have thousands of non-sensical unvetted garbage apps that don't work properly either (or conflict with the operating system). I haven't had any issues with my Windows phones acting like they're possessed (i.e. starting stuff up on their own without user intervention), haven't had to restart my phone because of a misbehaving app, and haven't had to pull the battery because it's frozen up.....EVER. My Windows phones have just worked, period, without fuss, and this one's no exception. Windows phones get their updates directly from Microsoft, without having to go through the manufacturer and carrier first. All Windows Phones operate the same; no learning curve when you switch phones. Best of all, they're as easy to use as an iPhone, and can be a whole lot cheaper. Windows Phone also comes with some nice features built-in that would need to be downloaded on an Android phone via the Play Store. A mobile version of Microsoft Office is preinstalled, so no downloading ThinkFree Office to view or edit your Word and Excel files. Bing search includes a song-identification feature and barcode/QR code scanner; no need to download SoundHound or barcode scanner apps, as on an Android device. When you register your Windows Phone on windowsphone.com using your Windows Live (hotmail.com, live.com or outlook.com) account, you're able to view the content of your SkyDrive--pictures and documents (7 GB free storage for as long as you have your Windows Live account) from any computer connected to the internet. If you lose your phone, you can find it via GPS, make it ring, lock it, or erase the contents of the phone all from the windowsphone.com site. Again, all this is BUILT IN; no need to go download a bunch of apps to get that functionality. If you don't have a Windows Live account, you can create one using your existing email account if you want. Microsoft doesn't force you to get a Hotmail email address like Google forces you to get a Gmail address for Android phones. Syncing your music and pictures with your Windows 7/8 or Macintosh computer is a snap; no ""drag and drop,"" it automatically downloads your pictures into your pictures folder and you can choose what music you want to sync and it happens automatically. One built-in app that's worth special mention is ""Local Scout."" For travelers, this can be a lifesaver. Local Scout uses your phone's GPS to tell you what's near you, like restaurants, attractions, and places to shop. All you have to do is to tap on a business or attraction name and you can navigate to that business or attraction, call them, add them to your favourites and more, without leaving the app. I guess what I'm saying is that if you want something as a playtoy and don't mind the fragmentation, frustration, glitches, force-closes, and misbehaving apps, then by all means, go get that 100-megapixel, 32-core, 64 GB RAM Android phone....it's gonna need all that hardware! However, if you want something that is useful, has a lot of built-in features, easy, doesn't fuss or fight with you, is fluid and smooth, and just plain works, then get a Windows Phone. If you want a great Windows Phone on a budget, get this one. It won't disappoint you. Edit: It's been a few weeks since I've bought this device for personal use and it still runs like a champ. Recently, I had to switch my work device to a Galaxy S3 and this Nokia runs rings around the GS3, even though the GS3 has a better processor and 4 times the RAM. As soon as work is over, the GS3 gets put away and I switch back to my Nokia 520, and I'm happy again. I get 3 days out of this Nokia; the GS3 won't last a day without charging it. Second Edit (6/7/2014): I downloaded the developer preview for Windows Phone 8.1 on this device and it works beautifully. Yes, great things are coming to Windows Phone, as the general release for WP 8.1 won't be out until summertime. WP 8.1 brings a notification bar that you can swipe down, showing missed calls, emails and texts, as well as toggle switches for wi-fi, bluetooth, airplane mode and screen rotation; you can also set a background wallpaper that shows through your live tiles; and the most important feature......CORTANA! Yes, Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Siri (Cortana works a whole lot better too) is even available for use on the ""lowly"" Nokia 520. You have to be a US resident for Cortana to work in the developer preview, no word yet if Cortana will be available outside the US in the official WP 8.1 release. Cortana even understands some sequential requests.....something Siri can't do. I put her up against Siri on an iPhone 5S and Cortana outperformed Siri by a comfortable margin. Budget-minded fans take note: When Windows Phone 8.1 comes out this summer, you'll have the best features at an off-contract price that can't be beat. There's no reason, except for FUD about the Windows Phone platform, to own an Android or iPhone anymore now :D. Third edit (2/4/2015): According to Microsoft, Cortana is available in several regions now outside the US, so if you live outside the US, give it a go, especially in UK and Australia. Windows Phone 8.1 will also be upgradable to Windows 10 when it's released, thereby unifying the experience across multiple devices. Fourth edit (3/23/2016): Microsoft announced on 6/17/2016 that only a select few devices will be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile, and this one isn't going to get the upgrade. The only x2x series device that will get the official upgrade is the Lumia 1520. Having used Windows 10 on a Lumia 920 before, I can say that going from 8.1 to 10 on a low-end device would be totally frustrating. The 920 lagged such that I noticed it, especially switching between apps and launching the Windows Store, camera, and Cortana. It was still usable and that was due to the fact that the 920 has 1 GB RAM. The 520 only has 512 MB RAM, so I wouldn't advise doing the upgrade on this phone. Given that, to upgrade, go to insider.windows,com and register as a Windows 10 mobile insider, download the Windows Insider app on your phone, launch the app and login with your Microsoft account, and then select the ""Release Candidate"" ring. Then, go to settings and check for updates. A word of caution: Once you upgrade the device to Windows 10, you can't go back to Windows Phone 8.x. Conceivably, one could restore the device using the Nokia Recovery Tool or the Windows Device Recovery Tool, but that route hasn't been successful for me.",11.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 520 (AT&T Go Phone) No Annual Contract (Discontinued by Manufacturer),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-520-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00E45043A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X1D2B1IKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00E45043A,4,59.99,0.0
1438,B00A2V7BA4,Philip,5,10-Jan-13,False,This is the best smartphone to date,"I looked at all the offerings and was about to get an iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy III (probably iPhone) if this phone did not deliver. It has everything I need and that is more than the other phones offered. The phone itself is more durable than the others and in my opinion looks better and feels better in the hand. The battery life is very good and performance is excellent. I am a developer and I can contest that the architecture and design both software and hardware are superior to Android and iOS in most regards. No doubt the others will catch up soon but for now WP8 and Lumia are the best of breed. I had let my 8 year old son (a computer wiz) play with the phone and he said it was much better than iOS and Android. When I bought this phone I also bought one for my wife. She quickly gasped why didn't you buy the iPhone? So I told her to go down to the AT&T store and replace the Lumia with the iPhone, no problem for my as I am a very big Apple fan. I had grown up near Silicon Valley, read Steve's bio (excellent), as well as iWoz (another genius) and have Apple products. So my wife went to the store and reviewed the other phones. She came home with the Lumia 920! The phone has performed very well and has survived at least one drop so far. Most of the big applications on the other phones are now also available on WP8.

20509,B07HD3QC65,Carlos M,1,10-Feb-19,True,Phone only lasted two months,"Nokia 7.1 was purchased at launch in November, but by mid-January, a Google security update corrupted the phone's OS and now the phone is stuck permanently in Download Mode. No combination of buttons has been successful in a recovery process, and the phone isn't recognizable when plugging it into my PC. It does charge, though. Contacting Nokia support multiple times has always led me to the same response: ""we'll need it delivered."" The real kicker is that there aren't any Nokia Care Centers in my country, so Nokia won't accept my phone for repairs! Fortunately, I contacted Amazon regarding this issue and it has been settled. ---Check whether or not Nokia can fulfill their warranty on this phone before buying. In my case, they couldn't. ---Be wary of a phone that gets possibly hazardous updates from Google. This feels like one of those times where Android One backfired. Anyway, during those two months when the phone was still functional, there are a few things that are worth mentioning. 1) The actual build quality is superb. No screws anywhere in sight, the copper accent (on the Steel color option) is gorgeous as it reflects light. Glass back. Feels very premium. Slap a protective case on it asap because it's slippery. 2) The battery isn't very good. With minimal use, the phone would be down to 32% before going to bed. 3) The screen is very clear and very crisp. Not too bright during day time, but colors definitely pop when you're indoors. HDR display is real. 4) The camera is painfully average. So, it's an acceptable budget phone with certain compromises.

On Amazon the black version is the least expensive and is my preferred phone color anyway. It’s un-locked so It works on AT&T, T-mobile, and others that use their towers, such as ( Tracfone, Metropcs, Cricket, Mint). It does not work with Verizon or Verizon based sim card discount phones. It has the pure “Google One” Android 9 system that comes with 3 years security updates and supposedly will get an Android 10 upgrade.

It is sharp and has good color. I put a 128gb high speed U3 micro SD card in and installed TomTom GPS that put the maps on the micro SD card. I also use Waze and Google maps in the city, but use Tomtom in Canada and US in the country as it doesn’t use phone data. Also, I moved the photo folder to the micro SD card. There is little or no bloatware on this phone so I have plenty of space with the 32 gb internal drive and can put movies, GPS maps, and game data on the 128 gb micro sd card. The front and back is the nearly indestructible glass so there is no need for a screen protector or even a case.

5407,B00TRLXO6U,judy,5,10-Dec-15,True,"... bought this phone to replace a 928 (that I love, love","I bought this phone to replace a 928 (that I love, love, love) because I broke my screen for a SECOND time in six months. It's cheaper than replacing the screen ($130) and a cheaper and a better Windows Phone than what Verizon is currently offering (in my opinion). I really wish I had thought of this before I had the screen replaced six months as I was never completely happy with it. It never really 'sat' right and and I had to get it adjusted a couple of times to fix the problem of not being able to hear anything on phone calls. Anyway... the phone is brand new in the original box. It is unlocked. Registering and activating it with Verizon was a simple process and rebuilding it to where my old phone was was just as easy. I was going to go into the store to do that, but I'm glad I decided to do it myself. It is a Windows 8 phone, and I had to do two updates to get to 8.1. My photos from my old phone were backed up on One Drive, and I can access them quickly directly through the app. That doesn't work as well using the One Drive icon in the Photos section. Also had my texts and contacts backed up so transferring them to my new phone was also much easier than I thought it would be. I also bought a better case so hopefully, I won't have to do this again!! It's a great deal.

2491,B00E45043A,Anton Tikhomirov,3,10-Dec-14,True,"Not atrocious, but by no means great.","At the time of writing this review, I have owned 2 Nokia Lumia 520s. I purchased this phone after I accidentally broke my galaxy S4. I knew my upgrade wouldn't come up for about a year, and I needed a phone to last me until then. This phone was $50, and a smartphone, so I went ahead and bought it. Then (entirely my own fault) I broke it, and chose to buy another one. It has all of your standard smartphone capabilities: it can text, browse the internet, get apps etc. The biggest complaint I see of Windows Phones is that there are not enough of the ""popular"" apps. I find that most of the apps I use (snapchat, tinder, instagram, facebook, etc), have ports for the winphone. These ports however tend to be pretty terrible. For instance, there is an app called 6snap which allows you to use Snapchat. It's slow, unresponsive, and crashes frequently. However this is better than no app. Other negatives of this phone include the fact that it's abysmally slow compared to other smartphones. It can multi-task, but when it does, it slows down to the point where it's a turtle. Overall I would recommend doing your absolute best to buy a phone for ~100 bucks that is better than this. In fact, try to find an older version of a top end smartphone (for instance find the Galaxy S3, or one of the older G Nexus models). They will serve you better than this phone. However, if $50 is all you have... I guess it isn't terrible..",10.0,Nokia,Nokia Lumia 520 (AT&T Go Phone) No Annual Contract (Discontinued by Manufacturer),https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-520-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00E45043A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X1D2B1IKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00E45043A,4,59.99,0.0
1670,B00A2V7BA4,Chris,5,10-Dec-12,False,Best Phone I've Ever Owned,"Being a 10+ year Sprint customer I've long since been in the underbelly of the hardware world for phones. Having gone full circle from Nokia's old 1000 series through Palm products (even the Pre) and then settling with the HTC Arrive when it debuted. I've used Apple Products (iPods, iPads, iPhones) and I've experienced Android products through coworkers and friends. I can safely say that not only is the Nokia Lumia 920 the best phone I've ever used, Windows Phone 8 is the best operating system I've ever used. The two work stunningly well together. The progress shown by Microsoft since WP7 was released gives me great hope for the future, the OS is brilliant and the 920 takes full advantage of everything WP8 offers with a massive screen real estate shown on the best screen I've ever seen (and felt, it even has a different feel than most products, very smooth glide). To anyone capable of taking the plunge, you will not regret it. A short review of the phone and my recommendations/experience with it... Don't be worried about its initial battery life, I panicked when I killed the phone's 2/3 of a battery in an hour when I received it. But after setting it up, tweaking the settings to optimize battery (turned off NFC, Bluetooth, dimmed screen, blocked Nokia Drive from running in the background amongst the main changes... I did leave on all of the backup utilities and location services) I'm sitting here typing a review from a phone with 99% battery after 3.5 hours from when I left (visiting Facebook, texting and making a call since then) and with another 25 hours of estimated life left (take this with a grain of salt until the software has at least 2 weeks of data to make a guess from). **Update** With the latest update from Microsoft/Nokia, the phone's battery has now been further extended. I can listen to music all day at work from start until finish while on wifi and get home with 50% of my battery left. Some people report as much as 3x the battery life, I've seen a modest 5 hours added to my day. Expect to take more pictures now that you have a phone that can not only quickly take a shot, but accurately (after trial and error, I rarely take blurry photos) and amazingly clear shots. Taking a picture of someone 5 yards away, I can zoom in fully on someone 20 yards away in the background and it is still clearer than my old HTC Arrive's regular pictures. Combine the camera with the 'lenses' features of WP8 and take Panoramas, use Nokia's Smartshoot (selects best photos of individual people and aggregates them into one shot), burst mode, etc. Then edit them right in the camera, add effects, automatically upload to Facebook, Skydrive (highly recommend everyone learn this very intuitive 'cloud hard drive' offered by MS) or elsewhere (apps can fill in the location). Do you love music but always seem to be on the go? Well not only can xbox music help solve that problem (the successor to the under-appreciated Zune service) but you can use Slacker, 3rd party Pandora, Nokia music, etc. Many products offering cached mode for your favorite playlists, refreshing when on wifi and giving you new music when you're in that dead-spot or saving data on your plan. Sound quality I've found to be better than the iPhone, on par with the HTC 8X w/ Beats. How about Office? Or even simply OneNote? As a college student I've been using OneNote for 3 years now, syncing my notes via SkyDrive and accessing them on the fly. WP8 + my Lumia offer me instant access to all of my notes at a moment's notice. I can search them, add to them, annotate to them, anything I need. Boot up my computer and those notes from my phone are now on my computer. It's a wonderful product that rarely gets used. But imagine using it to share shopping lists, to do lists, project notes amongst colleagues, etc. Its uses are endless. Induction charging? The one which comes with this phone works flawlessly, allowing a 'grab and go' policy. No more jamming the microUSB cable into the phone or tripping over the cable after you've hidden the charger's cable. If I weren't on AT&T I'd recommend the Datasense app to anyone looking to control their phone and their app data rates. MS gave the carriers the option to enable/disable this feature and so far only Verizon has activated it. I'll be happy to update this review in the future when my phone is still going strong and Microsoft has released a new version of WP8 during its guaranteed two year life cycle support. Meaning you will get at minimum two years of updates to this device, keeping it fresh and relevant to the growing phone industry. Have a question?

They all have there advantages and disadvantages. I personally love the Nokia Lumia line I carried the 900 which was a good phone but Nokia made huge improvement with this second generation as did Microsoft with the 8 OS. The camera is great every bit as good as the iPhone 5 and I use my xbox so the extensions for xbox music and the xbox glass app is really great and pretty cool. Tap and share NFC is awesome. Rooms for my fellow peers is a great app built into the OS and to sync up and share calendar events pics docs I cant tell you how that saves time and very convenient. Nokia Music is a great service for free and being able to save the music is just amazing nobody does that very unique service and Nokia Drive is the only GPS that after you download the map you need no network coverage to use the service and it is global too.

This is by far the best phone I have had so far. My first phone was a Nokia and I loved it and then I started trying out different phones all of which ended up being sub par (blackberry, android phones). The Best Things about this phone: 1. The screen is magnificent! Everything is so clear. The biggest thing I noticed with this phone which has always been a hassle to me is that you can see it in the sun. NO GLARE! That alone is one reason for me to get it. 2. The call quality is surpassed by none. Nokia has always had the best phones when it came to call quality and with it being an LTE phone it really doesn't get much better. 3. The camera is great and everyone knows that already so I am not gonna talk much about it. 4. It has a great sturdy body/shell, it fits so comfortably in my hand I don't have any problem with the weight or size. They also positioned the power button below the volume rocker which makes it so easy to reach when holding it in your hand. 5. The Nokia pre-loaded Apps are amazing. The maps unlike Apple maps are phenomenal. 6. And to be honest I am just a huge fan of live tiles. You get the customization of an Android phone but with the (in my opinion) better looking and sleeker live tiles. Which I feel look much better. 7. Also because the phone is a matte type finish on the back it doesn't collect finger tips. Those are just the ones I could think of off the top of head. Now for the cons of the phone: There really aren't any truly negative cons. 1. The only problem I have had is that the battery life sometimes does not last as long as I would like. On some days it will last the entire day but others it will last till late afternoon. 2. A wider App selection would be nice. But that will come with time seeing how Windows 8 is so new. Don't get me wrong it has great Apps and all of the ones you would need but if you are into all the little 3rd party indie style apps on iphone or android don't get your hopes up. Other then that everything is great. I am a college student so I am constantly on my phone and so I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy. I would definitely buy this phone again and lets be honest you can't beat the 99 dollar price tag and early adopters of the phone get the free charge pad where you just place your phone on it and it will start charging which is awesome because you don't have to plug in your phone anymore.",7.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

19362,B07DD71K4D,Thom Thomas,1,10-Apr-19,True,Useless paper weight. Known bug blanks the screen FOREVER until you send it in for repair.,"Up until today, I would have given the Nokia 3.1 four stars. Today, my son came home from school, pulled the phone off the charging station and couldn't get the screen to come on. I tried calling it and it rang just fine. I had Google Family link on it and I could make his phone play the locator sound. And it was still connected to the WiFi Access Point. So the phone was working perfectly but the screen was black. I Googled it and hundreds, maybe thousands of people are having the same problem with Nokia phones up and down the product line. It's a known issue that Nokia seems to ignore. I contacted Nokia support, they walked me through a couple of soft resets that did not work and then said, essentially, ""Bummer dude, hate it for ya bruh, but, like, ur gonna have to mail this baby in for repair."" This phone is under warranty but it's only 5 months old. I'm pretty unhappy that I have to mail this POS to Nokia who will probably send me a refurb with blemishes on the screen and/or random phantom issues. I'm in IT and I've purchased and supported more phones than I can keep track of. With the exception of Apple phones and Google Nexus/Pixel phones purchased from Google directly, most warranty repairs are a PITA. Huawei and ASUS are the absolute worst. Samsung - meh (don't get me started on Samsung - their french door fridges have ice makers that freeze up every 3 weeks. It's a known issue since 2015 or earlier.) I'm really not in the mood to go through this - even if Nokia support is not terrible, I still have to box it up, pay to mail it out, wait - and listen to my kid gripe and moan about not being able to call his cousin to play Fortnite. If Nokia sends someone to my house to pick up the phone and replaces the phone with the exact phone fixed or a brand new phone, I'll change this review to 5 starts. But until then - this phone is a useless turd. The only gripe I had until today is that 16 GB of on-board storage really isn't enough. Manufactures really shouldn't sell Android phones with less than 32 GB. Otherwise, the phone had been doing fine - until the screen stayed blank. TL;DR: DON'T BUY THIS PHONE or any other modern Nokia phone because they have a known bug where the screen stays stuck at zero brightness - it'll happen randomly and out of the blue and sometimes a soft reset will fix it but if not, you have to mail it in to get it repaired. Go on the Nokia forums - thousands of people having the same issue. When it happens to you, don't say I didn't warn you.",10.0,Nokia,"Nokia 3.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 16 GB - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/Mint) - 5.2"" Screen - White - U.S. Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-3-1-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07DD71K4D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rmi1HiNQL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07DD71K4D,64,109.0,0.0

3666,B00HWEMZ1E,kronos11,4,1-Sep-14,False,Liking it more and more as I use it,"When I first got this phone back on July 18th I was excited after doing so much research. Even though my carrier is Verizon I bought it directly from a Microsoft kiosk at the mall. Also if you sign a 2 year contract with Verizon Microsoft offers you phone insurance for $99 for the 2 years. Verizon charges $10 per month for the entire 2 years. So that is $240 for insurance via Verizon as oppose to $99 via Microsoft for the entire 2 years. I was disappointed it did not have Crotana, but new an upgrade was coming soon. I'm still waiting. After using the phone for the first week was not too happy as I usually have my phone on vibrate at the office or on my long bus commute to work so I would not disturb others. I was not too happy that it vibrated only once, so I missed a few calls. My old non smart phone vibrated a couple of times so I did not miss calls. As I kept on using it, found out it did not have speed dial. So I pinned my most often contacts to the start screen. As I keep on using it I found out the phone does a lot more. Yesterday as a storm was approaching my phone warned me via text as well as sounding an alarm. The camera on this phone takes fantastic photos just as good as my 20 MP camera. When I take a photo it automatically saves the photo onto ""One Drive"" and the photos instantly appear on ""One Drive"" on my windows 8.1 desktop and tablet (Samsung ATIV) computers. Also all contacts saved on my phone are also saved on my desktop and tablet in the Windows 8.1 ""People"" tile. Phone has plenty of useful apps as well as games, but I am not really a gaming person. I do have a programmable thermostat by NEST and will download the apps and see how that works. I commute by bus for over an hour to NYC and use ""Here Drive map"" app and it showed me the speed limit of the road bus was traveling on, but also indicated the speed limit the bus driver was traveling at. Can't wait for my phone to be upgraded to 8.1 so I can have Cortana. Been waiting since mid July so hopefully Nokia or Verizon upgrades the phone soon. I am sure by then I'll like this phone more and more. Pro: Excellent camera Coordinates with other Windows 8.1 computers you own. Plenty of apps Has Office 365, which I also have on my desktop and tablet (Samsung ATIV) computers Great map apps Lots of ringtones pre installed Can delete apps, especially apps pre installed on phone You can try apps before you buy them. Can dial a contact or send TXT via a voice command Cons: No windows 8.1 yet (Will come in 8.1 upgrade) No ""Cortana"" yet (Will come in 8.1 upgrade) No speed dial (May come in 8.1 upgrade) Vibrates only once, so you'll miss calls when phone is on vibrate.

I used my last NOKIA phone in 2009 and in the years between then and now, I was unable to find a phone with a calendar/ events scheduler & manager that was half as good...and yes, I used the BlackBerry, iphone, and a high end Android phone and they all came up short. This is a lovely phone. If you are considering buying this phone, I would recommend going to an authorised retailer and take a live one for a spin. Please don't listen to vox populi. I had all my co- workers discouraging me from buying this phone. When I asked them if they'd used the phone, they all said NO. Do your own research and make up your own mind.

3573,B00HWEMZ1E,Daniel Alexander,5,1-May-15,True,Snapdragon processor and a camera that shoots in 4k.,"Well I just wanted to try something different, and I'm glad I did. The Icon is impressive, faster than the iPhone I was using and the camera is way better at 20mp. This thing records video at 4k with 5.1 surround. Pretty much made my video camera obsolete. There are not as many apps on the Windowsphone platform but there are a lot being added every week it seems, that's not so much a problem for me, but the fact that I can not carry over my iTunes does.... It's a big deal, but I knew that going in. Everything else, is great. The phone itself is better in every way, the display, speed, sound quality of calls, etc is all better. But I miss my iTunes. The crazy thing is that the I6 has only been out a few months, the Icon came out on 2/20/14 and has a CPU that is twice as fast with twice the ram....and yes it is noticeable. The price point is not even comparable, I got the Icon for $0.01 with a two year deal, the i6 was like $30 a month for 30 months- which is still $900 despite what they tell you over at ATT when they try to get you on a ""next"" plan. Total scam in my opinion.

I think I chose Windows Phone by default, because I couldn't get an Android because my nephew is a rabid Droid fan. I couldn't go with iPhone just because. When I first started using it I was very happy with it. I learned how to get more apps. and only download apps with good reviews. But the screen froze up on me about 3 times. That really scared me. Two times I took it to Verizon and they showed me how to hold the on button and the up and down button down at the same time to get it to power off. It has been good for a long while now. The updates have resolved some minor issues and filled out some capabilities. I am very happy with the hardware and the software. The app store has some very good apps. OK, we were at my mother in law's and my nephew was bragging on his Droid and saying how Windows phone doesn't have good apps. We were putting in a dishwasher.

3604,B00HWEMZ1E,Cos,4,1-Mar-14,False,Best Expereince from a Windows Smartphone,"I have a sickness... I love to upgrade I have been with the Android Operating System since the original Sprint EVO Phone. To put things in perspective. I have had the EVO, EVO 3D (Junk) traded to the Motorola Photon, Motorola Droid Razor Max, to the HTC One. I have played around with unlocking, using custom roms, etc. Android is a great OS, tons of apps and a ton of phone choices. Given all this, why would I even consider switching.....I am bored When it comes down to it, most of the apps I use now are mainly for work, when I want to play games, browse the web, etc I use my Ipad Air. I wanted a phone for work and I wanted to try something new, so the Lumia Icon had the latest specs, so I decided to give the Windows phone a try. For me it's a hit, with a few misses UNPACKING (7/10) •Your basic rectangular Verizon (orange) box nothing spectacular •inside it is well packed with the phone, wall charger and usb cable, small printed manual •This is version 8 of the Windows Mobile OS, 8.1 is not released yet •Phone is boxy, with a significant amount of weight behind it, which detracts away from its excellent design, button layout, metal trim with polycarbonate back •Camera has Duel LED Flash in the back with Headphone jack up top and Charger at bottom •Phone feels heavy in your hands, but even with its larger bulk it fits well DISPLAY (9/10) This is where the phone shines, I really like the screen, it's AMOLED 1920x1080 screen. I agree with most of the professional reviews, colors are very vivid and bright, with excellent black levels, but fall a tad short on whites when compared to my HTC ONE. I do like the fact that you have a lot of customization when it comes to screen color brightness, etc. I put this phone next to my buddies Samsung Galaxy 4, and it just looked a tad bit better IMO. With the very thin border around the screen it give the illusion that the screen takes up the entire front. I did change the color scheme of windows, because the red was just to bright. BATTER LIFE (8/10) The battery life is quite good, I would say it's better than my HTC in that regards, but not by a lot. I do about 100+ emails a day, will watch an occasional Netflix program back and forth on the train and talk a lot for my job and still manage to finish the day with 25-30% left. This is only with 2 actual days of usage, but so far so good. USER INTERFACE (9/10) This is my first experience with the Windows 8 Mobile OS. If not for windows 8 on my PC, I probably would have never even tried this phone, because it looks like a big mess at first, but in the end, I was really won over by how much I could customize it vs. my HTC One. When I first turned on my phone, its was the basic walkthrough setup process, then I got to the screen and thought, OK what the hell do I do now? Turns out I was able to do a lot and was able to pick up the OS in a very short period of time with no instruction. I was able to do/learn things quickly and have quickly grown to love the tile system as it is PERFECT for me and how I want to customize my screen vs. android widgets. With high end specs it compares similarly to android devices in relation to speed, pinch zoom and scrolling, all work really well. EXAMPLE: By adjusting the tile and location of the apps I use most I was better able to maximize screen real estate better than any android phone I have used. I have the Phone tile next to my two email address tiles with the next row being my calendar voicemail, and weather forecast. In the same amount of space I have my less used apps as tiny tiles which I can put 4 into the same size as one tile. To me this is the biggest advantage of the windows phone as I can get to more of my apps quickly. While android purists may say they can do the same on their device, the point for me was how easy it was to do this with almost no knowledge of the OS to begin with. Additional observations, I think some of the same apps work better on the Windows OS. I definitely liked the LinkedIn and ebay apps much better than the android counterpart. That being said, there is often times I found the Android App to be the better choice. I do prefer the Android app access (i.e. 4column x5 rows vs Window OS 1 column scroll down and give my HTC the advantage of having a better media player. CALL QUALITY (8/10) This one is difficult to judge as its T-Mobile vs Verizon and to be honest the HTC One is the King of Sound Quality with its 2 speaker system. As far as making calls, I found the call quality to be equal on both. On the flipside, the HTC's speakerphone is significantly better, as it is against pretty much any device. I know that Nokia changed out the Mics on these headsets and I have no complaints APPS, APPS AND MORE APPS (6/10) If you are an App junkie, as I used to be, the Windows phone is NOT for you. They still have a long way to go to compete with either the Android or Apple ecosystem. I do NOT have HBOgo, VUDU, Amazon Prime Video, just Netflix. Other than that, it does have all the apps that I use for work (navigation, backups, Office) I like the Bing Finance app to track my investments and the Travel app for booking tickets. I also have problems with bugs on some apps, like my fitnesspal which worked fine on my android and Ipad, but required constant reinstalls to keep it going. CAMERA (9/10) Lumia is know for the excellent camera's and this is an area where it doesn't disappoint. Picture quality is excellent. Compared to my HTC one it stays if focus a lot better when moving around and overall picture quality seems significantly better. I have not been able to do a low light comparison, but the double LED flash on the Nokia vs Single LED on the HTC makes a noticeable difference. I have not played around with the customization and overall features, but will update when I have had more time. This is an area on the Nokia that seems like it's going to take a little bit of learning. NOTE: Shutter Speed, as reported on other sites is an issue, (i.e. Shutter Delay), but nothing is too significant for most general picture taking, but I could see having an impact on action shots. I could go into a lot more detail, but with one of usability, I would rate this phone an (8/10) Pros: - Excellent Screen - Easy to use and customizable interface and speedy - Solid build Quality - Good Battery Life (wireless charging works great) - Clear call quality - FANTASTIC Camera Cons: - A phone should not be this bulky in this day and age - Speakerphone volume could be a little louder - Apps....MS still has a ton of catch up On a side note I am excited to see with the OS 8.1 brings, especially the Cortana (siri / Google Voice) competitor.

3658,B00HWEMZ1E,LegoDad,5,1-Mar-14,False,A great upgrade from my iPhone 5,"I've been waiting for this phone for a long time. I got tired of Apple's ""50 shades of grey"" upgrade in IOS7, and so had my Verizon rep for my corporate account send me the Lumia 928 back in September of 2013. I loved it, and would've ordered one right there until I saw a leaked photo and some tentative specs of the Lumia 929 that was to be released in a couple months. I decided to wait, since the improvements over the 928 were many. I almost lost patience in November, December, and January when all the rumored release dates passed, but I'm glad I waited. My rep was able to overnight one to me so I had it on release day. I gave my old iPhone 5 to one of my employees and never looked back. This is a VERY nice phone in all respects. In every way I compare it to my iPhone 5, it wins. The only downside is the thin choice of apps still in the Microsoft store, but that's improving. The iPhone and Samsung phones started out the same way. The only things I really miss from the iPhone are a few apps, not the phone itself, since I have a lot of home automation, and there is, as yet, no Windows phone options for my Logitech security cameras, my Ecobee thermostat, and a few of my power switch modules. But apps aside, from a hardware perspective, this is a clear win. The full 1920x1080 screen is gorgeous to view. Even in sunlight I can see what I need to see. I was a little worried about the size for two reasons - first, I didn't want something that was awkward to hold. I've seen people with the ""phablet"" devices and I just can't picture lugging something like that around as a PHONE - may as well use my retina iPad mini... But I also just bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited, and the technology package in it has a special upper section of the arm rest that includes a Qi charging plate and a little sliding holder to keep the phone there. I really hoped this would fit in there ,and it did, even with a case on. Snug, but it works great. And the increase in resolution over the 928 means that there's more tiles I can fit on the main screen. And for me, that's where the iPhone loses compared to Windows. I never cared much for the lock screen's lack of information, which was why I invariable jailbroke my iPhones. And the limited options for the screens when the phone was unlocked made it annoying to have to dig into folders to find what I was looking for, or swipe the screen. I was very happy when they made folders an option, so you didn't have 20 or 30 pages of icons, but it still was annoying sometimes. I like that with Windows I can resize the icons and fit lot of things that I use daily on a single screen. I also love the live tile implementation of things, so I can see at a glance what's been happening without having to rely on a notification center type of screen. It's easy to hold, since in reality it isn't THAT much larger than the iPhone 5 was. The buttons are easy to get at and responsive. I like that they changed the USB port to the bottom, since the 928 had it on the top and that just drove me bonkers during my week of testing. The sound is quite good for such a small device. The processor is snappy, which makes sense since it's the quad core snapdragon processor. There's little to no waiting for pretty much anything I open on here. Graphics are incredible and smooth for the few games I've put on here so far. Zooming photos or the camera is also very smooth. And the camera - it's amazing. I have several higher end digital cameras, and an awesome $1600 Sony camcorder, but the photos this turns out are more than acceptable to me. It used to be I'd ""settle"" for photos with my iPhone due to convenience, when I didn't want to lug my large camera case around with the cameras and lenses for some event. And yes, if I really want to capture something to the best of my ability, I'll use my real photo equipment. However, for the other 95% of the time, I'll be more than happy to use my phone now and not have to carry anything else out. The options are easy to get at, white balance, ISO, flash, so many more options that with the iPhone... And the single finger zoom, rather than the pinch, or the slider at the one spot on the iPhone, makes bracketing my pictures so much easier. I find I can get just the shot I want so much easier with this than I could with the iPhone, and the quality, needless to say, just doesn't compare. The 20 mp camera here and the optics used make you think that there was no way this photo could've been taken by a phone. We have a client in a medical building that's on the lower floor, and in their server room, we NEVER have gotten a signal with any phone from any carrier. And yesterday I was able to receive a phone call in there, and hear and be heard. That was a first for our company in that site. Another pleasure for the phone is being able to hit ""END"" and have it end the call. I've spent most of my time after the IOS 7 update on my iPhone being unable to end a call myself, it would not respond to me pressing ""END"" no matter how many times I tried. Phone calls would only end when the other side hung up and my phone realized it. I love the built in Qi charger. I had a Duracell case for my iPhone and another extended battery that charged on a proprietary pad, and had gotten used to that method of charging. So I bought two charging pads, one for the office, one for home. I've gone through three cases so far trying to find a good one, and the charging on the pads and even in my Jeep works through the cases just fine. It's a convenience that you don't realize you'd use until you get accustomed to it. No plugs, no cables, just set the phone down and the charging begins, with no special case required like the iPhone. The back gets a little warm, but I've never felt it get hot no matter how long I had it placed on the charger. This has quite a large battery in it, and initially I thought it'd last longer than the iPhone, but the downside to the live tiles is battery consumption. With little talking and little game playing, it runs down quicker than you'd think. I went from 100% at 7 AM at a client site to about 40% left after 8 hours. There's a lot of forum posts out there about things you can do to lessen the impact, but for me I'd rather deal with the battery consumption and have all my data, since this is first and foremost a business tool for me. Each mail account has its own live tile so I can see at a glance what the status is of new messages for my own Exchange server, or Gmail, or my Windows Live account. I'm not much of a facebook user but it's there as well, keeping me updated on info for my family. All of this visible without opening any programs up. For me, that convenience makes up for the battery being used quicker. Another bonus for me is with my Jeep. I have the large Uconnect system, that can let you do voice texting over the stereo system. This never worked with my iPhone, but it works fine with the Icon. It reads me a text, and I can voice back what my reply is, and the car will repeat what I said and give me the opportunity to accept what it heard, or change it. Very handy since I don't pull up the phone to send or receive texts and such while driving. Another thing I don't use much, but it's nice to have when I need to. For me, the lack of an expansion slot for an SD card or something isn't an issue. I have a Lenovo Helix tablet / laptop that I use for all my data. I pull photos to it from my Onedrive (used to be Microsoft's Skydrive) so I really don't have a need for extra storage on the phone. But for some people who use a phone as their center of their digital existence, it will be a major issue. So if you absolutely must have additional storage on the device, this may not be for you. But with the the seamless cloud storage integration, I don't think it's that critical for a lot of people. And I like that I have such a viable option for Microsoft Office documents here, that I can open a Word document from my Onedrive and it looks like I expect it to, and that I can edit it and then have the results later on my computer when I'm back at the office. All in all, I'm 100% happy with the hardware, just a little impatient with developers of the programs I need for home automation to make a Windows Phone variant of their software. There's nothing I feel I lost in my transition from the iPhone, I've only gained. For me, this is a much more usable phone in all respects than my iPhones ever were. And it's a big step from the old Windows Mobile phones back in 2007 and 2008. This is one phone that shows that the Windows Phone platform isn't just a fluke, and it has all the opportunities to flourish. Of course, that success isn't in Microsoft's hands, but in the hands of the people who write apps.

2272,B00CQAODG4,UTX Reader,4,1-Jun-13,False,Very nice phone,"I wanted to try the W8 phones out because honestly, I just wanted to try something new. I was a little bored with my Android phone(though otherwise very happy) and not ready to jump to the Iphone since it was the same thing I had been doing with my ipod touch for years. I first tried the HTC 8x as I was a very satisfied HTC android user. The phone was beautiful but I didnt really like the feel of it in my hands, it dropped calls terribly, and some of the software that I was use to having for free on my Android device, such as the turn by turn voice navigation, just wasn't there, and the camera was just serviceable. I had a few other qualms with it that were really making me consider jumping back to Android.I looked at the BBz10 (nice phone but a little complicated) and the Samsung S4 ( wasn't available yet on Verizon), and the HTC One ( would have gotten this but it is not a Verizon phone). I also though of waiting to see what the next Iphone would look like but as it was like just to be a 5s, I couldn't imagine it being exciting enough to make me jump to that platform. Then this phone came out to good reviews. So I decided to try it out. I have to admit that I am surprisingly happy with this phone. Everything that I didn't like in the HTC 8x is improved with this phone. Nokia just has more software, and that sofware makes the user experience. Also I think call quality is superior and I have only had 1 dropped call since I have had this phone. The camera is very good as well. So far, the only thing I would change would be to round the edges slightly and to take the weight down a little more. Other then that, I am a pretty happy Nokia W8 phone user. Happy enough to want to see what the next operating system update will add to the phone. Happy enough to stick with w8 platform until I can see what is the next great thing Android and Apple comes out with. I don't know about os loyalty at this point but I'm more than satisfied with this phone.",26.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 928, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-928-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00CQAODG4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zkjf9ksSL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00CQAODG4,349,0.0,0.0

Lifechanger. going from Apple iphone 4s to Lumia 920, WOW, the screen's HUGE! so is the phone, but I'm not concerned about weight. It's just as heavy as the 4s so i wasn't making any concessions. I love the LIVE TILES! the battery, i find the same as my 4s. BUT, i took someone's advice and drained the battery all the way down and charged it back up again.

2371,B00CQAODG4,Kyle,4,1-Jun-13,False,"Windows 8 Refreshing, innovative, and in need of support.","When windows 8 tablet came out, I immediately jumped to them. The metro interface carried from Windows Phone 8 is a fantastic touch interface, but having a regular desktop, micro sd slots,full usb ports made them the most versatile platform by far. Windows Phone 8 on the other had is a more limited, simplistic, and straightforward OS. Coming from Several Android, Iphone, Blackberry and even Windows Phone 5/6 devices I was pretty excited to see how things would work. Design: Honestly as first I thought it was a bit chunky, It has a lot of bezel, and is pretty thick. However after using it I really realized this actually helped usability a lot. It feels better in the hand and it's easier to operate than some of the phones trying to be as thin and bezel free as they can. Every time I hold it I just think that this is the best feeling phone I've ever had, I'm just really in love with the design now. Honestly I think they could have gone better with making it a 16gb with a micro sd slot, but windows phone isn't so great with SD cards I don't think (read software for more info) so i think it had something to do with that. One other thing I really miss is a notification LED on the front notifying me of missed texts/calls etc. Performance: Even though it's last gen hardware now, 1.5 ghz S4, 1gb ram, 720p screen it doesn't hold it back at all. The screen looks gorgeous (I can't tell the difference between a 720 and 1080p smartphone screen honestly) and it performs like a champ. It would have been nice to have 2gb of ram when going through the multitasking sometimes it had to resume the item which takes quite a bit. Software: Here's the big difference, The software, in a word is refreshing. The animations I thought would get annoying but keep the flow of movement really well, and when it gets done 9 times out of 10 the app is ready and loaded right away. Live tiles are really great, I had a couple of issues with some not updating right, but either way they make the main screen extremely lively. The ""app drawer"" I guess is what you would call it when you swipe to the right, It is functional but with only a single line of apps it makes kind of cumbersome sometimes. Windows phone 8 also doesn't allow access to the file system like android does. For instance I had a comic book reading application to read some .CBR files I had. I couldn't connect my phone to the computer and put the files on the phone to use though, I had to upload them to skydrive, then link my account with the app and download them. While I'm glad that atleast you can do this, it makes a 2 step process to like 5+ steps. The only thing I really found I could drop on and use from the internal memory was media files. One odd thing about the software is the search button, on windows 8 the search button will search throughout whichever app your in which is great. However the search button on windows phone is only a hotkey for Bing. It's kind of counter-intuitive, and should honestly just be a Bing button. Apps: This is a grey area, of course Nokia can only do so much on this front, it's up to the developers to make these apps, and Microsoft to attract them. Most every app from my previous android phone I was able to find. The community has been really great at making great alternatives to the missing apps like Flipboard, instagram, youtube and most everything else, finding the needed apps wasn't really a problem. A big HOWEVER though is that I found some apps missing functionality, they were like the red headed stepchild app of their android/iphone counterpart. For instance in both the official ebay app and an alternative one I was unable to add tracking information on my sales or manage my messages really. This is just one of a few I found that were just not up to par with the functionality i expected. Most of the time it isn't a deal breaker but it's something to think about. Things I miss are firstly a notification center. I pretty much manage everything with the live tiles but it would be great to have a spot to just check everything together though. Widgets I don't miss much, the tiles replace it almost mostly for me though one thing I would like would be interactive tiles where I can do things without actually going into the app. Camera: Lumias are known for their cameras and the pureview on this was no exception. It has a really bright f/2.0 lens, and whatever else the pureview technology does to help. The camera button works perfect, it will turn it to the camera from being off and it is a 2 step button meaning you can half press it to focus. Pics I took in low light looked like they were taken with like sunlight shining in, they turned out amazing. I tested it against my other canon point and shoot and the lumia blew the canon out of the water as far as low light performance. There are a ton of cool lenses that you can download to do different functions as well. The only thing that is missing however is the ability to take pictures while recording video which i really miss. Battery / Call quality: I'm not sure why people combine these 2 but they do, so why not try it. Call quality had no issues, I've heard complaints on other reviews but I experienced no signal difference or call quality from previous phones. Battery life was more than acceptable. After an 8 hour work day of between light and medium use I would have over 75% left usually. I had no issues lasting a day. From 6am waking up till 10pm going to bed I would almost never be below 50%. Also the wireless charger works without a hitch, thought the phone got decently warm during it which was odd. Conclusion: Well Microsoft has something really amazing on it's hands, Windows phone is just a joyful, unique experience. It makes heads turn, you can't go into work without having someone ask you about it. However can it replace your current smartphone is the question. I manage my life on my smartphone, and it needs to be able to keep up with me. My experience finds that Windows Phone will most definitely be able to keep pace. I do think that unlike an android device though I wouldn't be able to manage everything on my phone. If I were away from home or something I would probably need to access a computer at some point to manage thing. It just doesn't have that versatility yet. However Coming from the Iphone users will get an experience that is just as or more fluid, crisp and easy to use.

1099,B00836Y6B2,Kevin Ramsey,5,1-Jul-13,True,Don't Listen to the Haters,"I purchased this phone after carefully researching my next phone purchase. I was tired of Boost and Virgin Mobile and the terrible service they provide and their watered down phones. Don't believe anyone who tells you the phones manufactured for these prepaid services are the same ones that are released to contract carriers. I had the EVO on Virgin Mobile and Samsung Galaxy on Boost and they were nothing like the same phones given to my friends from contract carriers. You get what you paid for. After receiving this phone I can truly say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I am as left leaning liberal as they come and it pains me to give the thumbs up to a major corporation, but the fact of the matter is that Nokia is a superior company to Samsung and HTC and AT&T invented the phone and has the largest 4G network. So when combined these two companies have created an untouchable product. This is my first windows phone and I can say that the OS is unbelievable. People choose Apple and Android b/c they are inherent Microsoft haters. However Microsoft powers the world whether they like it or not. This phone works smooth and the screen and looks are top notch. It never hangs or needs rebooting and the features actually work the first time you click them. The back button on Android is a joke there is no telling where it is taking you. When you press the back button on this phone, you go back to the previous screen. Isn't that a notion??? The camera is not the best in the world even though it is a name brand camera, but for goodness sakes it is a phone - who cares. I have also read the reviews that say the phone is ""locked"" to AT&T and this is not true. Yes it says AT&T on it but it works on any GSM network. Not too mention, I put it on AT&T's Go Phone prepaid plan so I am getting 4G LTE unlimited talk and text for $60 per month, and they sell the prepaid cards at a million stores and gas stations and you can setup your account online and AT&T even takes e-checks. I am done with the empty Android promises, locking phones, freezing screens, and inferior battery life that the Boost and Virgin Mobile phones provide. I don't even have to charge the phone every day and I talk over 5000 minutes per month. I will admit there are some apps like Mapquest and Google Maps that I miss from my android phone and AT&T charges for their navigation service. I will also admit the screen is no where near as brilliant as an I Phone or Galaxy or even the upper end Nokia. But I will gladly trade that for a phone that works everywhere and that does not freeze every five minutes. And I have invested $200 in the phone and I am paying $720 a year for 4G service on a great network and I don't have a contract and I can still sell this phone on Amazon a year from now for $100 or $150. Compare that with spending $500 or more and having a contract and spending $100 per month for unlimited. There is no comparison.

2372,B00CQAODG4,Talvi,5,1-Jul-13,False,Verizon Exclusive,"The Lumia 928 is very similar to the Lumia 920 and is exclusive to Verizon. Verizon customers can therefore rejoice that they can get their hands on one of the few high end phones on the market that isn't a ""me too"" phone. Like the 920, the 928 has a 4.5 inch screen (a sharp and vivid 1280x768), a zippy dual-core 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, and a gig of RAM. I've put this phone through the hell known as my backpack and the 928 has triumphed - still no scratches on the wall-to-wall gorilla glass screen or on the matte polycarbonate body. Since one of the reasons I love this phone is the form factor, I'm very happy it hasn't been degraded no matter how often it gets jostled. I had a Lumia 900 for a long time before upgrading to the 928, and I'm impressed that in under 2 years, Nokia managed to put out a phone that I fell in love with. This didn't happen the last time I upgraded my iPhone, that was more of a `ho-hum' situation. This phone sits in the hand better and is easier to hold and use. It's a little lighter and slimmer than the 920 but continues in the `bigger is better' recent smartphone trend. The really nice upgrade is the Carl Zeiss camera with image stabilization. The xenon flash gives better low light performance and the 8.7 MP PureView camera takes superbly sharp and vibrant photos. PROS -Impressive photos, including better technology for low light / indoors -Wireless charging -Verizon's impressive coverage -4G -High-performance mic and speaker -Free turn-by-turn navigation, very easy to use Maps, virtual reality, and location-based apps -Still challenges you to be good at maximizing your battery time but less challenging than previous versions -Windows 8 OS, which is intuitive and easy to use, an impressive performer and highly customizable, and a hell of a lot better looking than the iPhone (OS upgrade is expected later this year) -Renders websites beautifully CONS -Although I have found all of the apps I use regularly, a more app-driven person might not find everything they'd like on the Marketplace This phone is gorgeous. Just get ready to be asked a million questions about it when you take it out around a bunch of other people - and then you can tell them just how smokin' a deal the subsidized cost is. Update: I just had a friend visit and she dropped her phone and broke the screen. Being the nice person I am, I let her use my 928 for a couple of days (I roughed it with my old Lumia 920).

1663,B00A2V7BA4,Hook 'em Horns,5,1-Jan-13,False,Love the Nokia 920,"The Nokia Lumia 920 is a great phone. I only have one regret with it, but the phone itself can't be blamed. I have to carry a Blackberry for work so I have been avoiding wasting money on a personal phone for years. I have a Samsung Galaxy media player that I really like and have been using for a while. It is only WIFI though and I find myself constantly tying to find hotspots and wishing I could regularly use some of the features. For Christmas my wife convinced me to go ahead and get a Smartphone. I also have an IPAD2 for work and an Android tablet for home, so I am well versed in all of the operating systems out there. With that said I had been looking at the Windows phones for a while and really liked the look so I broke down and got one. I couldn't be happier, of course that will probably change once the monthly bill starts coming in. First the phone itself. I love it! It is solid and responsive. It operates extremely quickly. It feels comfortable in my hands. It has a great camera, 8.7 megapixels, and has Image stabilization for low light shots. That fact and the Carl Zeiss lens were huge selling points for me. I am a professional photographer and one of the things I was looking forward to is not having to carry my hug camera around all of the time when I was just out running around with the family and wanted to do some happy snaps. Being a photographer it is tough to judge the camera because I know what it would look like if I shot it with my pro gear, but I will tell you it is pretty good. As good as if not better than most point and shoots cameras out there. You can even make manual exposure adjustments; change the ISO and white balance. The best part is the ability to edit it right on the phone with the software and instantly upload it to FB. It all worked like a charm. The 4G seems to work quickly. I try to use it on WIFI most of the time though, but it is great to now have the Internet access no matter where I am. It helps me keep up with the Metro trains so I get there on time instead of just missing a train and having to wait forever. The screen is beautiful. Movies and photos look great on it. I can't imagine needing anything else on a small phone. I can watch HD movies and they look and sound great. 32 GB's of memory and you can use the cloud drive. Battery life is pretty good. No Smartphone is great but this one meets my needs with no issues. I have only been close to dead before the end of the day once and I have been playing with it a lot. The one time it ran extremely low was when I was running GPS. It eats the battery pretty bad. I took a three hour round trip using it both ways and it was at critical level by 11:00 that night. That is easily solved though by having a charger in the car. In full disclosure I turn off the wifi and 4G when I know I am not going to be connecting to the Internet so it isn't draining the battery for no reason. It charges wirelessly. I really thought it was kind of a gimmick and a waste until I started using it. I love it. You just place the phone down and done. It seems lazy and stupid, but trust me after a couple days you will never plug it in again nor will you want too. Video shoots in either 720 or 1080P. Best part of the hardware is the price. Amazon has it for $39.99 with activation. On to Windows. I love it! Yes it may not be as fully customizable as Android, but I am willing to bet most people out there have no idea how to or even attempt to fully customize their phones. It is absolutely customizable though. You can add favorite photos that will be used as backgrounds, you can change the appearance of your tiles in size and color, and you can align everything where you want it placed. It is extremely easy to do. The live tiles are great. You will see the actual text messages without even opening the app. Your contacts sync with Facebook and display their facebook profile on the tile. The weather will show you the current temp and condition without even opening the app. It works great. Yes there are widgets in Android, but the Windows phone is easier to use and setup. It integrates fully with Office and comes already installed. There are a ton of apps with more coming. Anything you can do on an Android or Iphone you can do on this. Are all the apps the same, no, but they are there. This includes many that are better. Nokia provides you with an actual GPS navigation app that you can download the maps you need for the state or ""country"" you want ahead of time on a wifi network so that you are not using your data plan up on navigation. It is fully customizable too for walking and driving and fastest/shortest routes and others. I just wish it actually said the street names like my Garmin, but maybe they will fix that in an update. It does display the street names though. Nokia has a ton of other great apps for it as well. The photo editing apps work well and it has a great Nokia Music app. It also has Nokia City Lens that you can hold the phone up and it will show you everything that is around you like food and shopping and provide phone numbers, directions, and reviews. It is great if you are in a new area and just out hunting for something around you which I love to do a lot. There are a ton more. Overall I absolutely love the look and feel of Windows phone 8. I really think they got it right. It is extremely simple to navigate and set up. You can make it look however you want. All of the function work well. The phone integrates with it perfectly. As I said I have an IPad 2 so I know the Iphone functions and I have the Galaxy player, which is the exact same thing as the Galaxy phones, so I know the Android functions. I completely prefer Windows. I know there are a lot of haters out there who will be little these phones simply because they hate Windows and will never even touch one to give it a fair comparison. They have to have their IPhone so that they can be trendy not even understanding why. I guarantee if they try Android and especially Windows and give it a true honest test they will be totally happy. Just maybe not feel as popular. Now there was one negative with the phone. Now the bad; it is on AT&T. I rarely ever get a full signal especially indoors. I am in an apartment only maybe 25 feet from my huge windows in a huge city and I don't get a full signal. With that said it has gone from three to four bars the last couple days. Still I run into limited signal strength at times where my wife on T-Mobiles Wal-Mart branded ""Family Talk"" plan gets a strong signal. AT&T supposedly has the faster Internet network though. That I can't verify because my wife's phone is still 3G. I probably should have bought the phone outright and taken it to another network, but it does work and I may have a low signal, but I still usually have one. I am also told AT&T is building heavily onto their network infrastructure and in soon it will be extremely strong and reliable. Call quality is good, but I haven't used it enough yet to make a judgment on dropped calls. None as of now. The other absolute minimal issue is the size. Some may find this an issue I don't at all. The phone feels absolutely solid. I like the fact it has a little weight to it. The HTC 8X just feels to light to me and a little flimsy. Now for a female maybe that will be a bigger issue, but I am not sure about that either because my wife preferred the size and feel of the 920 too. It is a solid tank. After only have it a day I was doing some video and the thing shot out of my hand and bounced down a couple cement steps without hardly a scratch on it. You would have to look hard to see where it initially hit the ground. I have the same confidence in its build that I do in my blackberry. The last item I would HIGHLY recommend a case for it. It needs a little grip. It is too slick hence the flying out of my hands, but that is a non issue. You can find a case that adds almost no size onto it. You won't need an insane heavy duty one because the phone is so well built. Conclusion: This is an absolutely great phone and operating system that I give 5+ stars too. I can't quit playing with it. The bottom line is if you can care less about how you look and simply want a well functioning phone that is a blast to use, has great and useful apps, and is extremely easy to set up and use then go with a Windows 8 phone you won't regret it.",13.0,Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T)",https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Black-32GB/dp/B00A2V7BA4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UTfUPGH1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00A2V7BA4,468,209.67,0.0

The Lumia 920 is indeed an all around phone. It is a strong and durable phone. It may feel a bit heavy in the beginning, however, the weight is not noticeable after a day or two, in fact, I feel must comfortable carrying it in my hand (although it fits rather nicely in my jeans, my sport coat, and my pajama pants while I lounge at home)the Lumia was designed to be a tool one can carry and really on for work, recreation, or whatsoever your bag may be. The App, the Apps, why is everyone so big on this app craze? The phone is loaded with everything I needed. In fact, I went surfing for apps to add just to use up some of the memory on the mobile, but, it seems that everything that I needed is on my Lumia already, I downloaded all of the Nokia offerings, USA today, CNN, Bloomberg, Calvin and Hobbs, Chase Banking, Starbuck easy pay (cool) and a few others, but, there was really nothing else I needed...the phone is a complete package.

1643,B00A2V7BA4,P. Allen,5,1-Feb-13,False,"I was hesiatnt about WP at first, but no regrets","Like many out there considering making a switch, I was hesitant about WP. I had an android phone and carried an iPad. I was happy with both platform and Windows seemed risky. Still, the clean design was appealing to me and I had been a fan of Windows Mobile in the past - going back to the original Palm-sized PC. I first made the switch with a Lumia 900 and the 920 improves on the experience. If your favorite thing about your phone is Instagram and Pandora, this is probably not for you. In my opinion, WP is the best mobile plaform out right now, but until it sells better, it will not be at the top of the list for developer attention. If you MUST have specific apps, check the app store and see if they are available. Be aware, there are lots of great alternative apps when very popular apps are missing that are also worth a look. But if all your friends are on instagram, that probably doesnt matter to you. The Lumia 920 has the best camera you will find on a cell phone right now. It works great in low light and video is smooth thanks to PureView. You have the ability to focus at very close range (macro) as well. The only thing I would wish for is more zoom, but lets not get greedy. Where this phone and WP in general shines is in the core functions. Email, web browsing, camera, navigation, messaging, are all top notch. Its even top of the class when it comes to making phone calls. The People Hub, as other's have mentioned is like nothing any other platform has to offer. From the people hub you can do things a normal contact app can do, plus see a feed of content from your facebook, twitter, linked-in and other networks. Like and comment facebook posts and retweet something all from a single unified feed.

1766,B00A2V7ULY,M. Dipaola,5,1-Feb-13,False,A beautifully awesome phone!,"Having had in the past HTC's, Nokia N81 unlocked(which was my favorite and in my opinion the most advanced at the time, expect for iPhones keyless keyboard) iPhones and Samsung galaxy2. I was in the market for an upgrade. Judging from past experiences and researching and reading reviews...I knew I didn't want another iPhone, as many have said not much innovation thru the years(my Nokia N81 had video calling 6yrs ago even thou no carriers in the USA provided the service)yes some tweaks here and there, yes they are lighter but most definitely more fragile. I see many people walking around with cracked screens especially iPhones and galaxy 3s, the one great thing about the iPhone 3GS was it's build and quality it can take a beating and not break. I was very close to purchasing a galaxy 3 nice looking screen good sound better than iphone 5 in my opnion, but something about the build didn't quite convince me so I decided to wait for the Nokia Lumia 920 and check it out (wasn't ever interested in Samsungs Note 2, way to large). I'm glad I waited for the 920 It feels like a premium device it reminds me of the iPhone 3GS great quality, the screen is beautiful, the color options are great(got a yellow one), Windows 8 OS works great for me the live tiles are a breath of fresh air you run you finger along the screen everything has a smooth feel, great speakers, the Nokia apps are great Nokia music pretty much unlimited music, Nokia city lens is an innovative app, Nokia offline GPS app and on are all free. NFC, Yes finally wireless charging, I lost count of how many chargers I've purchased for my Iphone. Last but not least...the camera it's awesome in dark light conditions its like magic you can't believe it, and it shoots great videos as well with image stabilization...having kids this phone is great don't have to worry about carrying a separate camera. Some people say the 920 might be on the hefty side, but if you put a case on your phone the weight is about the same, the 920 doesn't need a case checkout the YouTube videos out there. The App Store doesn't have nearly as many apps available that you can get on a iPhone or Android stores, but I have most of what I need. The OS is new so more apps will be available soon, I can see the difference in the month I've had the device they've multiplied.

1431,B00A2V7BA4,AlanAndMel,5,1-Dec-16,False,Love my phone!,"I didn’t buy my phone on Amazon but since I check Amazon reviews before I buy anything, I wanted to add my review here. I loved my old Nokia Lumia 520 but I lost it. I wanted an upgraded version to replace it and this was in my price range. The Pros: This phone is really fast; there is no lag when I open any app. The volume is really loud. The phone is heavy and comparable to an iPhone in feel and design (I hate iPhones). I love the internal storage; you never have to worry about the phone saying that there's not enough room even though you have a 32gb micro sd card installed (that's why I dislike android). The rear-facing camera is actually quite nice (I never use the front-facing camera so I can’t comment on it). The Cons: Once in a while, it loses WiFi and I have to either turn WiFi off and on or set it to airplane mode for a minute. When compared to the pros, this doesn’t even merit removing a star in my opinion. It's true that Windows phones do not have a lot of apps like google or apple but it has all of the apps that I need as a working professional and a student.

1640,B00A2V7BA4,Christopher Reeves,5,1-Dec-12,False,A gigantic step forward in the Smart Phone Set,"I have owned a smart phone of some sort for a very long time, primarily as a function of my job. I began in 2001 holding and using a Blackberry (I believe a 7xxx at the time?) And migrated through the Blackberries. At a certain point, though, things changed and the iPhone became my primary smart phones. I owned the iPhone 3GS/4/4S. When the 5 came out, I had hold of it on release day.. and was immediately let down. Longer, not wider didn't provide me the features that I was looking for, and it appeared obvious to me that Apple had lost the thread of real innovation. I played with the Samsung Galaxy S3, and frankly, was impressed. The screen was nice, the layout was nice. But some of the key functionality within the Galaxy S3 struck me as lacking just the key comforts.. and, frankly the Galaxy S3 build quality seemed to come across to me as ""cheap"" despite the high price. It just didn't have the finish, the camera shots weren't what I was after. Being willing to experiment with multiple phones, I had my eye on giving Windows Phone 8 a try with the Nokia 920. I've had the 920 a couple of days, and I have to say I've rarely used a phone that made as much quick sense as the Nokia 920. Let me go over the pros: * Live Tiles are a more efficient layout method compared to either iPhone or Android. Frankly, the instant live rolling track system that for me monitors email and updates (twitter/facebook) is both sensible and fast. You will never flip through pages on your phone to find what you're looking for, and pinning items to your front screen just makes sense. * SkyDrive integration is a MAJOR benefit. One of the greatest qualms I had about the iPhone as well as the Android was the way my pictures came off once I had taken them. Seemingly saved in high compression JPEGs, or exportable off the phone in a compressed format (photostream or email or whatever) the Nokia 920's ability to save high quality shots straight to your online Skydrive . I had no problem getting full quality high resolution images that look stunning and absolutely put what I was getting on the 4S and Galaxy to complete shame. But Skydrive's other big benefit is the easy integration into your Windows PCs (7 and 8). I've long used DropBox and Box, but SkyDrive's unifying factor across your Windows platforms really gives you an unbelievable level of access to your home PCs when you're on the road. * Key functional apps are better on Windows platform.. and that's not a joke. I'm not a huge app person.. and I recognize that the Windows8 App Store is growing (quickly) but it's still significantly smaller. That said, several of the apps I use on a daily basis are improved from their Android and iPhone counterparts.. Audible for WP8 is THE best offering in a mobile environment of Audible, period. It's clean design and easy to use layout really works incredibly well. * Contact integration of multiple sources (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) is so smooth that you'll be surprised how fast you're up and going. * File Format Support: Yes, I could do this with Android as well (kind of) but being able to quickly drag .AVI, .MP4, .WMV files onto my Nokia 920 and have them playable on the phone quickly? Fantastic stuff.... I've always recoded several in the past, but really nice to not have to break out mediacoder to get it into a compliant MP4. * This has one of the best looking screens I have ever seen on the phone; text is bright and easy to read, video and picture quality is also fantastic. Even in sunlight, this phone remains incredibly easy to read and use. I can't explain what a big bonus this is in comparison to a lot of the alternatives. There are some negatives: The Syncronization tool is in beta, and it's pretty rudimentary. You're better off just dragging and dropping your stuff onto your phone or using Windows Media Player (yeah, I know). I'm looking for a better synchronization tool, but reportedly MS is coming out with one soon. The App Store is growing.. but a lot of the key apps you may be used to aren't there yet. Spotify has said Q1/2013. Pandora is also a Q1/2013. So, if you're an early adopter, you're going to wait a month or so for several big name apps to happen. That having been said, since most of my big apps were there (Bank of America, Audible, a Tapatalk reader) are available now, I'm willing to invest and buy in. Yes, you'll find Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja etc. :) Many peripherals I'm waiting on will take a bit.. ATT is giving away a free wireless charger, but odds are you're going to have to wait for yours to get delivered. All said, if you're looking to do something different, to break with the herd, this is the phone to grab. Fantastic screen, very fast LTE performance, great built in browser, and the extras that come with it are great. I didn't even mention the Nokia exclusives (Nokia Maps, etc.) which really help make this the best bang for the buck smartphone on the market.

14215,B071ZDQ6MV,Jesena,1,1-Aug-17,True,problems over problems - do not buy,"Update #2 Forget about it, just don't buy this phone. I had plenty of problems almost right from the start, but now it almost doesn't work anymore. The phone is really just junk now, it freezes all the time, apps crash on a daily (hourly basis), text messages only go out if I restart the phone (and not all the time either), it won't log into any wi-fi anymore, so all is now on data. I'm waiting for black friday and some deals, but once I get a new phone, I will take my car and drive over this one. UPDATE: Ok, sorry but I have to drop my rating by quite a lot, the phone turns out to be a pain in the backside. I had so many issues already and the tech support is really sad. They don't have anyone that would be able to assist with problems beyond the knowledge of the techs on the chat/phone. The latest issue is the icons being stuck after messages, downloads etc and I did all they told me to do, restart, empty cache and nothing helped. The tech had no more ideas and suggested a factory reset, I've done that before and I will not redo my whole phone again. Out of previous experience, it doesn't solve the issues the phone has. His next advice was to return the phone, well, that time passed too. I have to be honest, if amazon would allow me to return the phone, I'd go with a different brand and not buy Nokia again. I'm sad to say, this phone turned out to be a huge disappointment so far. If I hadn't paid so much money ($220 is a lot for me), I would just drive over it and buy myself something else. I think this brand could be great, might just take a couple of years and some more phones for them to figure out support and to resolve the many bugs they have. I was so excited in the first weeks, but every time you have a problem or find a bug, the same answer is, restart, empty cache and if that doesn't help, do the factory reset. --------------------------------- Ok, so I got this phone right when Amazon offered it on the market. I was always a huge fan of Nokia and even went with the Lumia while they were still working with MS on phones. I was so sad when they quit making phones and I stuck with the lumia line, which I'm sooo glad I can finally drop (not good phones, no support and only a pain to deal with). I was considering getting an android already last year, but when I heard that HMD is reviving the Nokia brand, I waited a whole year to see what they came up with. Granted, I had to put in some patience, since it took forever for them to get the phone on the US market. I was about to buckle and buy the new Motorola 5 series. The positive (coming from someone that had a low line lumia for a long time): - camera, very nice and makes great pictures, I'm pretty sure there are better ones out there, but it's good for the price - easy to use, not a lot of bloatware to delete - great quality, it feels sturdy and well built - huge storage to expand - has dual sim in case you don't need to expand memory (kind of a negative too, it is one or the other, you can't have both) - display is great and very clear even in sunlight Negative: - no fast charging option - the processor is very slow and I don't do much with my phone, but I noticed it - there is no way to transfer your stuff from MS Lumia to Android, not sure if that is the phone's fault, but my hubby spent days researching and working on getting my stuff moved over - there is no option to snooze your calendar entries, might be android calendar problem, but it's annoying - there are not a lot of accessories to buy, hope there is more in the works. I got a case but it is super boring and bland - tech support isn't very helpful with questions All in all, I'm very happy with it, I finally made the change over to Android and couldn't be happier. Thanks Nokia for being back and who knows, I might be persuaded to buy a slightly more expensive one down the road. The price was definitely a draw to Nokia compared to some other options out there.",8.0,Nokia,Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphone (AT&T/T-Mobile/Metropcs/Cricket/Mint) - Update To Android 9.0 PIE - 5.FHD Screen - Blue - U.S. Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61291x3og8L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071ZDQ6MV,558,109.0,179.0
