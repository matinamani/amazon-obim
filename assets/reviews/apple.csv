14743,B0731HBTZ7,alma,3,9-Oct-19,True,It's alright,"At first glance, the phone is in perfect condition. No scratches. Set up was easy. However, after using it for about 2 weeks, I have noticed some defects. The battery healths maximum capacity is at 86%, it should be at 100%. Siri doesn't work, it doesn't let me set it up. Wifi turns itself off sometimes and does not let you turn it on. Calls will either not go through or will sound static-y, low, like is the person was far away. I have also been told that they can't really hear me on their side. Video calls don't work sometimes like FaceTime and Facebook's Messenger's video calls. I have to turn it off and on because it decides to act up. Just today, after having it for 2 weeks, the battery started dying faster than usual. That is all I can think of right now.

Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I’ve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I’ve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It’s flawless in your hands. It’s faster than any galaxy or iPhone I’ve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I’ve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It’s constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it’s BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it’s very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold.

Once it was fully charged, it started glitching out. It would crash, then cycle through the boot process indefinitely without success. Occasionally (after up to 1.5 hrs of cycling - see video for example), it would boot up and I would get it unlocked, only to have it crash as soon as it had to process a simple request (like receiving a text message or opening Settings). I couldn't connect it to my computer long enough to back up my data. I also couldn't get it to connect to iCloud to turn off Find My iPhone so I could erase it. I had to log into my iCloud from a friend's device and report the phone as missing/stolen and wipe it remotely so I could return it. If I hadn't been tech savvy enough to do that, I'm sure I would have had to return it with all my data still on it. I hate to say it, but it felt like an information hack/identity theft move to me.

I was looking for one to use with Straight Talk on their Verizon network, but most iPhone 6 or greater cost around 450. I was incredibly skeptical of this, but gave it a shot. It's only my first day, so I know things can always go wrong, but so far it's working well. Came with the phone and charging cable. The box it came in looked a little rough, but the phone was fine. I only noticed 2 very small cosmetic flaws and they don't bother me in the slightest. The screen is completely free of imperfection. Setting up the phone with Straight Talk was a little tricky, but that had nothing to do with the phone, in my opinion. In case anyone else is planning to the do the same, here's how it went for me. I did the BYOP activation kit and am using a new number - I did not port an existing number. I slipped in the ""Verizon"" sim that came with the kit and tried to activate it online. It told me the phone wasn't compatible and I was disappointed. I called customer service and we were able to get it up and running, despite the representative also being unsure that it would work.

It was updated to iOS 12 already, which I was worried it wouldn't be and I would have to do that myself. It came with a USB cord and a really nice wall charger which was a nice touch for a third party seller. I have heard good reviews about BuySPRY and they all come up to expectations. I think the screen protector I put on made the touch screen less sensitive but not by much -- it's worth the pain for an uncracked screen. Set up was fast and easy and if you have a SIM card, you can just pop it into your new phone and data plan and cell plan is instantly transferred over.

I looked at NEW Verizon plans (ahhh, no thank you) and other providers and decided to stay with Verizon, but get a refurbished phone. The question was now: Android or another iPhone. After reviewing um-teen million reviews, I decided on another (yawn...!) iPhone (shocking!) Now the question was, WHICH iPhone (another yawn). I heard about problems with the 6, the iPhone Pluses were tooo big and the 8s and up were toooo expensive for my needs (hey, it’s only a PHONE!), so I decided on a....you guessed it, refurbished 7. Well, I am not disappointed. Slightly larger than my 5s, more memory (bunches more!) and in very good condition...NO scratches, gouges, or screen problems. My only complaint is the home button is strange. I like the the old mechanical home button better, it had a better feel, but then, I’m an old, non-vegan, meat-n-potato’s, non-gaming, non-craft beer, non-tweeting guy who grew up with rotary phones at home, and pay phones on the road. All in all, I give this phone, and the seller, a 9 out of 10 after a week of use and loading apps and discovering new features. I’ll check back after 6 months and update.

12139,B06XR8G1TX,Albert Rodriguez,1,5-Aug-18,True,Mine came with a few issues. From Kiss Electronics Inc,My phone came a few issues but I do realize that this might have just been a bad one that I received. 1. The phone is pretty beat up all the way around the edges. Not a big deal to me as I assume this is a used phone and a case covers it anyways. 2. The battery is completely shot. The percentage will drop more than 50% within an hour of just browsing the internet. This will cause me to need to pay $30 to get it replaced. 3. It also seems to have trouble charging when connected to a car. I have to restart the phone for it to start charging properly. 4. The speaker is pretty busted as well. When playing sound or talking on the speaker you can hear a lot of static. 5. The touch screen seems a little wonky. These issues have been frustrating and I will probably return the phone soon and order another one. Hopefully one without so many issues.,4.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Fully-Unlocked-64GB/dp/B06XR8G1TX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81s7ZLOGOWL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B06XR8G1TX,394,156.88,165.0

I emailed the seller and hopefully there can we a way to fix this. if there is I'll change my review to five stars. But until then I'm sticking to two. If you want a FULLY functioning iPhone you should probably buy one from a different seller. Just my two cents. UPDATE #1: I sent out an email to Blutek and I did not get a reply. Even worse, the speaker blasts static for a brief moment when I raise the volume. It only happened once and hopefully it doesn't happen again. UPDATE #2: Called the original seller and no one picked up. Emailed the seller and didn't get a reply also so I turned to Amazon for help.

19984,B07G7FG26S,Britney Y.,4,4-Oct-19,True,You’ll like it,"This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest.

I’ve cleaned it several times and there are no scratches so I’m assuming dust was left inside the body of the phone and has migrated over top of the lense. Otherwise, I love it! Just wish I could use all features. I originally got it to have a good camera to use to take pictures for my business but obviously it’s not going to be able to be used for that now. I’ve had it 20 days now and attached images of the cameras quality as of now(just keeps getting dustier/worse). Original: The pin needle sized nick on the back and a pin needle sized scratch next to one of the screws on the bottom but otherwise the phone is in PERFECT shape! I swapped SIM cards from my old phone and got this baby up and running in just a few minutes!

24917,B07RDMLR4V,Jeff S,5,4-Dec-18,False,Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here’s why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn’t find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that’s different from Samsung, it’s better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn’t burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it’s battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don’t lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don’t mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That’s over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I’m still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy’s S Voice. I don’t have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that’s significantly faster especially when you’re in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that’s not a fair comparison but it’s reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can’t compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It’s not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don’t take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don’t have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don’t own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you’re spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you’re in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can’t believe I waited this long to switch.

9247,B01GXAT0CE,R C.,5,4-Dec-18,True,Much Better Than Expected,"I wanted a second phone as a backup to my iPhone SE. So I decided to buy another one just like it. The SE is just the right size and performance for me, but sadly they have discontinued the model. I found the 64gb Space Gray Unlocked unit as a refurbished product at a good price from a seller called MyWit. It was a Prime item fulfilled by Amazon which I always look for. I had heard some horror stories about buying ""refurbished"" phones, so I contacted the seller with some questions. These were answered promptly and courteously, even though it was the weekend. Based on the contact with the seller, I made the purchase on a Sunday. My phone arrived on Tuesday afternoon, and I was surprised to find that it was in a sealed Verizon carton that said ""Certified Pre-Owned"". Everything inside looked new, and was wrapped in plastic and shipped with plastic film on it to protect the screen. I could not find a single mark on it that would indicate it was used. It came with a genuine Apple charging cord/power adapter. I had some concerns about whether it was really unlocked or not since it came from Verizon, and whether or not it would work on AT&T since my carrier is GSM and not CDMA. The seller had assured me the phone would work with either. I also wanted a second phone I could use when I go overseas. I'm a phone dummy. I know how to talk and text on them and not much more, but I followed the on-screen prompts on power up and simply placed the new phone next to my existing iPhone. In about 45 minutes the new phone had updated itself to the latest IOS version and transferred everything from my old phone, leaving all my things intact on my original phone. Very cool. Then the final test was to see if it was really unlocked. I put my AT&T SIM card from my original phone in the new phone, and at first it said ""No Service"" and I was disappointed. But in less than 30 seconds, the phone found service on AT&T and I was able to make a call. So, the phone really was unlocked, and worked on a GSM carrier. Excellent! So far I am incredibly pleased with how this worked out and with the seller. I paid $179.99 for the phone on Prime, which I think is incredibly fair given its condition and the fact that I paid more than $500 for the same phone just 2 years ago.

I thought no big deal it's a refurbished phone. The first week it worked great, everything functioned as it should but then around day 10 it started overheating quickly. The next few days it would die a lot faster than it had even when I put it on low power mode. After that I noticed the screen was popped out more, almost like all the overheating was making some glue or seal for the screen melt so it separated. The final straw was when it would be at about 70-50% battery then just suddenly turn off and die, when I tried turning it on it showed the screen suggesting you plug it in, so I did. Then it would turn on the second I plugged it in and show 1%, then change straight to 10%, then 20-30% and I would take it off the charger and it would die right away again. It did that for 3 days before I decided to return it. I didn't even have it a month.

9244,B01GXAT0CE,Alexander Lindsay,5,31-May-18,True,"Great price, great phone, and great quality (and a warning)","This phone was about half the price of a new IPhone SE, and replaced one that I bought that was run over by a semi truck (long story.) It included a wall charger and phone cord (it didn't include headphones), and a brand new looking IPhone. It only had 1 minor scratch on the back of the phone. However, since it is a refurbished item, I would think the quality can vary from device to device. WARNING: As it is a used item, I would recommend THOROUGHLY inspecting the item. Running screen checks, a battery capacity test, checking for water damage, checking the IMEI, looking to see if the seller has a high rating, the works. (if any of that sounds confusing, just look up those terms to check out what they mean. It takes about 15 minutes or less to perform your total check, but you save literally 100's of dollars. If that sounds like a lot of work, think of it as paying yourself $200 for 15 minutes of work! If you make $600 an hour, sure, buy a new phone. If not, there's no reason not to get this one!) If your phone passes your inspections, great! you just banked a few hundred dollars and have a shiny, new-to-you phone to use. In the unlikely event the IPhone ISN'T up to spec, simply contact the seller. You get 90 days to solve the problem, so you can return it if theres a problem a few months down the road.

Cosmetically like new with 100% battery. I also received an email from Amazon saying it was an Amazon refreshed phone and I had a full 90 warranty. Also, I did not buy the cheapest phone at $167, I went down the list and found it a seller with very high ratings and $185 price tag; well worth the extra $18. If you are not sure if the seller gives the full 90 days, I would recommend calling Amazon; they call you back in 30 seconds! Make sure you understand what you are buying BEFORE you buy it.

16639,B07755LZ67,Holly,5,31-Jul-19,True,iPhone 8 Plus!!!,The phone came in the mail 2 days late but I don’t think that was the sellers fault - other than that I’m very happy with my purchase! You can’t beat the price. There’s just one little scuff on the right bottom edge but other than that this refurbished phone seems brand new. The phone came completely dead but I don’t really mind that I just charged it - the battery life came at 92% I can’t complain! I think it’s definitely worth buying a refurbished phone over a new one if you’re looking to save money. I felt mostly safe buying this because of the 90 day warranty Amazon Renewed promised.

12142,B06XR8G1TX,Tec,4,30-Mar-19,True,Mixed Reviews but I think it about who you purchase from.,"The phone was as I expected. Came in a generic box with charger and cable. It was also unlocked. Because of other reviews, I thought I would put it through its paces before I commit to transferring to this phone. WiFi and Bluetooth were the first test and did great. I updated the OS and then transferred my old phone content over to the new phone. Everything transferred without an issue. I then updated all the apps and that also went as expected. The final step was to add this phone to my Xfinity Mobile account and transfer my T-Mobile pay as you go number over to this phone. It all went fine, after giving the operator the IMEI number from the phone, and the information to transfer my number over. After about 15 minutes the service was moved over to my new phone. I had some concerns after reading other mixed reviews. But I think the other reviews are correct. It may be about whom you purchase it from. I purchased from BuySPRY. The only thing I was not able to test at this point is the battery life but I expect it to be good as well.

12226,B06XRG6S73,JB,1,3-Aug-18,True,$200 for a phone that is not refurbished,"Ordered this phone through Electronic Deals. Took it to Verizon for a sim card and found out the sim card tray was bent. The technician was able to get the sim card in, but with some difficulty. The battery in this phone is useless. It only stays charged for about an hour. Electronic Deals sent us a new sim card tray and said they would reimburse us up to $20 toward a new battery. It is a major inconvenience to try and find an Apple Store where we can go get this taken care of. They aren't exactly located all over - the closest one to us is an hour and a half drive away. Ordering one of these phone is taking a chance and hoping that maybe the one you order will be decent - but very likely not. I think Amazon should require that these phones be in better condition before being sold. The response I got back from Electronic Deals was that I could return the phone if I'm not happy, but that isn't the easiest thing to do once you have activated it with your carrier and then don't have another phone to use in the meantime.

7756,B01CR1FQMG,Stacy,5,3-Apr-17,True,All good so far.,"TLDR: Great phone, looks new. Pay attention to who the seller is when you make your choice - the seller changes when you choose a different color. I bought from BuySPRY. All good so far. I was incredibly hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon after reading so many negative reviews on various products. I spent a lot of time researching my options and figured this one was probably my safest bet. Phone came in perfect condition (seriously, it looks brand new) and so far all the functions seem great. Set up was easy, unlocked, ready to set my fingerprint and everything. It's fast, sleek, and beautiful. Camera and audio are also great. What I learned: who the seller is is very important. Although all the phones on here are iPhone 6S 64GB, when you select a different color, the seller changes. When you scroll down and look at the section ""Compare to similar items"", you will see who the phone is sold by. Looking at the reviews, most of the negative reviews seemed to be associated with the Space Gray more than the other colors. I then looked rating of each seller for each color of the iPhone 6S 64GB and went from there. As of the time of this review, the Space Gray is listed as ""Item Under Review"" because of the customer feedback.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-6S-Unlocked-64GB/dp/B01CR1FQMG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412jWjEIzKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01CR1FQMG,1,160.08,659.99

Called T-mobile to try and fix since it was a service issue, but they exhausted their options on trying to solve problem and suggested I call Apple instead. Apple tech support also exhausted their options. They mentioned to me that according to the serial #, the phone is a part of the first bunch sent out when the phone was first made that had some kind of defect, that they will replace it with a new one on an even exchange. Sent my phone in to apple, only to have it sent back to me with the email (see photo attached) saying that since the phone has 'unauthorized modifications' they will not send me a new one.

16425,B07753NSQZ,Les H,5,28-Mar-19,True,A great phone from a great seller!,"I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised). I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8 in 5 minutes tops. I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7. It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge. I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection.

The delivery was on time and the packaging was good. The phone was in great condition, the only thing I noticed were a few slight dings where it may a fallen with the previous owner but it’s nothing serious or too compromising (knowing it’s a pre-owned device). I purchased my screen protector and case separate but I was curious if it came with a screen protector since most of the pictures here has it on, so I just thought it may be good to know. Finally I don’t wanna make this too long but I noticed that most of the bad reviews here are due to peoples sim cards not working, and that’s easy to figure out why with just a little research. It says in the title that the device is GSM unlocked which means it only worked with AT&T, T-Mobile and some others I think, but not Sprint and Verizon.

14736,B0731HBTZ7,Matthew,1,27-Oct-19,True,"Buyer beware, purchase another model or buy elsewhere!","Where should I begin? Well, let's start off with something positive, this iPhone 7 is a solid offering (on paper) at the current price point. In theory, if the device delivered is in the condition listed on the product page, how can you go wrong for about $200? I hate to break it to you, but this can go VERY WRONG in a relatively short amount of time. I'm currently on my second renewed iPhone 7. The first one I only had for about a month and then the screen decided to separate from the metal casing of the iPhone, so I logged into my Amazon account and processed a warranty replacement. The warranty replacement showed up in two days time, no complaints there. I'm currently on my 2nd device from the original purchase and then I start getting battery life notices popping up on screen, and then a few weeks later, the center of my phone display starts to form a slight curve and gets more pronounced as the week progresses. I take my iPhone to the Genius Bar at their retail store and come to find out the battery in my iPhone has failed and is starting to bulge and expand while still in the phone. Normally I would log into my Amazon account or contact customer service and see what options are available, but of course, my warranty expired six days ago as of this review, so officially I have no warranty coverage. When I did try to contact customer service, I talked to four different reps over the course of about an hour on the phone and finally the two options provided to me to resolve this issue was...#1: ""Contact Apple and see if they will honor their warranty"", small problem with this is that there is only a 1 year limited warranty on iPhone's and the one year warranty started when the first owner had this phone. The phone is about two years old at this point I would assume, but definitely NOT covered under any warranty by the manufacturer. But their retail stores are more than happy to take my money and repair it. Option #2: ""We can make an exception and you can send the phone back in. Even though you have a damaged battery, UPS will still take the package. We even have a warning label we can provide you that you can put on the box."" Normally I would be more than happy to go with this option, however, the local UPS store has made it abundantly clear, they will not accept a package with a damaged or potentially damaged lithium ion battery due to the fire risk. The only way the phone could be safely shipped is with a fire resistant packaging which I don't have and the local UPS Store also does not have. Bottom line, I'm stuck with a phone that has a failing battery and glitchy phone display because of the swelling battery AND I'm also out of the money I paid for this iPhone, and I don't have a properly working phone. I would suggest the following, purchase a pre-owned iPhone elsewhere or just go with another phone all together, don't bother purchasing an Amazon Renewed device, the quality and reliability just isn't there.",2.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7 32GB, Rose Gold (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-32GB-Rose-Renewed/dp/B0731HBTZ7,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cRE43zKwL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0731HBTZ7,452,199.95,210.0

I then sent and email explaining the issue and got a reply back that said Do a hard reboot to the phone and it should be fine. I did that several times, and the same issue.

Lightning Cable 3. USB Plug 4. Original Box What was not in the box 1. Earphones 2. SIM Card Removal Tool 3. User Manual The cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals. Earphones Have always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker. Phone Condition Body is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket. Screen Condition It came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine. A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside. It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now. Battery Condition  Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup. Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV. Setting it up Phone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory. Camera No scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp. Speakers No issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops. Microphone, Lighting Port No issues. Works. Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree.  Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller. Reviewers need to say who their seller was. My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most.   This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop.

It was decently priced and I was desperate. It worked great, looked and felt brand new, I had no problems connecting it with my carrier! After about 6 months, it started to freak out and restart all the time. My apple ID no longer would work so my imessages were turned off, I couldn’t facetime. It was a nightmare! Also when I would barely put it down on a table the screen would freak out and it was restart again. Sometimes I would have to forse wake it. The people at the Apple Store told me that there was something wrong with the hardware and that many certified refurbished phones have had their hardware touched or messed with during the refurbishing process. I ended up getting a brand new phone about 8 months after I purchased this one.

24853,B07RDMLR4V,Daniel T.,3,25-Jul-19,True,So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews.

11284,B01N4IHGHI,Jordan,1,25-Jul-19,True,The worst seller we have ever dealt with on Amazon,"We contacted this company several times since we purchased an iPhone from them, both during the 90 day window, and outside of it. Their service has been absolutely useless. In my latest exchange with the company, I asked that they please provide an unlock code, as the phone is apparently tethered to AT&T's network's, and AT&T advised us to ask the seller for a code. We somehow missed that fact when we purchased the phone, unfortunately. The seller's flat response now is that they refuse to provide any answers to questions, or any support outside the ""90 day window"". We have purchased many other products through Amazon in the past, and had companies even replace defective products that were well outside 90 days - some even committing that they provide support for the life of the product! Amazon is a wonderful forum, and we are grateful for their platform - but this is a bad seller. I recommend steering clear of them and purchasing your iPhones through a different vendor on the Amazon platform. With regard to this product which we purchased through this vendor, we have now been advised by AT*T that the IMEI number is not even associated with an AT&T phone; although they advertise it is tethered to the AT&T network. We have never been able to activate this phone through any vendor since we purchased it last October, but have only been able to use it on WiFi networks using Google hangouts. We are basically the proud owners of a $175 paperweight, and the seller could care less.

7758,B01CR1FQMG,Amazon Customer,1,24-Oct-17,True,DEFECTIVE BATTERY & CAMERA - I do not trust them and don't think you should either.,"The product was defective and I wish I had chosen another retailer. It's not too late for you. 1. DEFECTIVE BATTERY - The phone was defective the day it arrived. The battery does not hold a charge consistently or indicate how long it will actually last. This defect is sporadic—so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I thought I was doing something wrong at first so, after a few weeks of frustration, I did a test to see: tracking how long I charged and how long it lasted. This confirmed it was not my fault or a defective charger and that the phone I purchased from Electonic Deals was the problem. 2. QUESTIONABLE SECURITY - Since the day it arrived, I've had someone trying 'access the phone' remotely who is not me. I have never experienced this when I purchased a new phone or one from a credible phone reseller. 3. DEFECTIVE CAMERA - The camera stopped working entirely with no clear cause as I did not drop or damage it in any way prior to this malfunction (however, to be honest, I did scratch it in the corner but this was ironically just last week). All these problems lead to some unfortunate experiences. An unreliable phone can leave you stranded in dangerous situations: Once I charged the phone all day at work, and left late at night so I called a cab. The Electonic Deals phone died by the time I was outside, leaving me locked out and stranded. The cab never came and I had to walk through the city by myself at midnight. It can also risk your job: I had a 100% charge before going to bed so I did not plug it in to charge (reasonable) and it died before the morning so my alarm did not ring. I was late to work several times because of this and ended up buying an old alarm clock. Why didn't I send it back immediately? - Initially, I was not sure the battery issue was a defect. I tend to trust sellers and waited to verify this before accusing Electronic Deals of making a bad sale. - The requests to access my info made me not trust sending it back. Maybe it was Electonic Deals and, if I sent the phone back, I would be at risk of identity theft. I still don't trust this and will bring it to a techy friend to clear my data... - A cell phone is no small purchase. The time between returning it, receiving my money back, and purchasing a new one would leave me disconnected and out 1K. - Once I did confirm this, I had come up with a system: use it only when needed, carry an external battery and always have it plugged in when at work, home and near a power source. Ignore the requests from the mysterious person and hope for the best. Once the camera died, it was very doomed and clear I had been swindled by Electonic Deal. Note: After many emails, the company eventually said I could return the phone— however, they included terms that essentially negated the offer to take it back. Maybe the return terms were a mistake and they will send me my money back in full. However, I've received no gestures of good faith or indication that they sell working products or do fair business. I may have to take the $500 loss because it was my choice to test instead of returning immediately. So my advice is to pick another seller and, if you run into ANY issue, RETURN THE ELECTRONIC DEALS PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY. Rate them 1 star. As of this point, I do not trust them and don't think you should either. Also, if you have suggestions for another more credible retailer please share it with me in the comments so I can find a new working phone!",237.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-6S-Unlocked-64GB/dp/B01CR1FQMG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412jWjEIzKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01CR1FQMG,1,160.08,659.99

The lull between the order being placed and delivery had me worrying I would open a box and pull out a chunk of scrap metal. However, this was not the case. It did show up in a generic white box and it did include an Apple charger and wall adapter. I had to charge it roughly 5 minutes before being able to power on. I went through the setup process and it asked if I wanted to allow the “Township of (can’t recall) access to remotely monitor this device”. It gives you the option to select remove monitoring and goes through another factory reset. My package arrived a day earlier through FedEx. The lighting in my picture makes it seem if the top edge has a stain of a scuff. This is not the case.

12108,B06XR8G1TX,Lisa Regis,2,23-Apr-19,True,"Questionable quality, STILL negative impression overall","Did not come “professionally cleaned”. There were greasy fingerprints, gooey crap on the back, and the microphone holes and jack input on the bottom had crusty crap inside, like flakes of skin and nasty mucus. UPDATE: Removed the plastic screen protector to replace with a glass on I purchased separately, and the screen had faint scratches ALL OVER the screen like the phone was rubbed on sand(?!?). Luckily the adhesive for the glass protector filled in the gaps and it looks good. I also noticed a hairline crack of ~2mm from the edge of the home button. So far it hasn't spread, but I can see it being a future problem to be wary of with normal wear and usage. UPDATE: After using the speaker extensively, I noticed the sound quality is worse than an old iPhone 5s. It sounds like a cheap speaker that hasn't been burned in. The sound is loud and the maximum setting projects nicely but the sound quality is sub-par for this generation iPhone. Did not come with manufacturer made cable and charging plug(Apple). It was some random generic off-brand, but the listing did say they may be. Although the description portion says it won’t work with Verizon or Sprint, it has so far (~1day). The features and details contradicts the Description and says those two carrier do work as well. UPDATE: Still working on-network taking calls, voice mail, texts, and iMessage (~4days). Phone got EXTREMELY HOT when downloading data to the point of burning skin if held too long. UPDATE: Phone still gets hot downloading small MB downloads. Battery was NOT “at least 80% capacity” in settings and had a message to service the battery. Will be testing battery life extensively. UPDATE: (~4 days) Battery lasts fairly well with extensive screen, location, and bluetooth usage. Even streaming is fairly light on battery usage.

Contacted Apple store and was informed based off of battery statistics that battery was faulty and needs to be replaced for 29.99 Scheduled maintenance for next week Results Will update after trip to Apple and verify true quality of the phone Overall Honestly it’s an inconvenience about the battery but even with the additional fee of replacing battery phone still comes in under 300 for a 64gb 6s I wish there was more clarity as to what certified refurbished means but all in all still satisfied with product though customer service may be a problem if your issue is major luckily my problem was only 30usd,19.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-6S-Unlocked-64GB/dp/B01CR1FQMG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412jWjEIzKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01CR1FQMG,1,160.08,659.99
7762,B01CR1FQMG,Anon,5,22-Mar-19,True,Super Satisfied,"I'm going to do a blunt review: 1. The phone came in three days, which was an awesome surprise because it had originally said 7. 2. The phone is looks new. No scratches, no dents. 3. It didn't come charged and booted up in about 5 minutes after plugging it in. 4. The phone WAS unlocked and the original language preference was set to Spanish. Aha. 5. It took a bit of ""oomf"" to open the sim card tray. I was a tad nervous after multiple attempts, but I pushed just a bit harder on the last try and the tray basically fell out. 6. About the battery: My battery health is at 81%. I've used it for about 3 hours at a rapid pace, downloading apps, setting stuff up -- and it did drain a tad, but I wouldn't expect anything different. I can bet money that it'll stay charged for at least another 4-5 hours with minimal usage. For anyone complaining about the battery, it's because of one or both reasons: A. You're simply glued to it and won't put it down. B. You have notifications on for everything, maybe maximum brightness, maybe multiple widgets? I highly recommend keeping these off, but I can't speak for everyone. What I do know is this: If you NEED all of those things, I'd recommend replacing the battery with something new. You can grab a DIY replacement for about $20 - you do NOT need to go to Apple for their specific battery. If you're like me that really could careless about having notifications/multiple widgets/etc on, the battery is literally FINE. 7. The device is extremely responsive and FAST. 8. It looks and feels sleek - was even thinner then I expected. 9. The rose-gold color is beautiful. 10. The device came with 5gb used out of 64gb. After downloading an intense amount of apps, I've used 7.4gb/64. Pretty awesome to not have to worry about space! 11. I think the price-point is fantastic for what you're getting. Yes, in about 2 years, updates will stop releasing on this model phone. However, considering how little malware lingers on iOS, I think it's safe to say the phone will last as long as you take care of it. 12. The camera is gorgeous, and the front-facing camera is one of the best I've seen to date. 13. The headphone jack works, the speakers work, the thumbprint lock works. 14. The phone is compatible with T-Mobile and AT&T. I'm really unsure about the others. 15. Don't go crazy over the negative reviews. I was starting to psyche myself out and almost didn't buy it, but i'm happy I did. Should anything not be up-to-par, I'm sure it's either fixable or returnable.",40.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-6S-Unlocked-64GB/dp/B01CR1FQMG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412jWjEIzKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01CR1FQMG,1,160.08,659.99

19174,B07D42T6MB,Lostboy8,1,22-Jun-17,True,Wrong charger supplied.,"My experience wasn't so great. When I got my iPad, all I wanted was to check it out. I could not because it was dead as a hammer! I plugged it in with the supplied charger, and after five hours it still would not come on. Would not begin the start up. At this point I called Amazon customer service after spending over an hour with the rep, all attempts to get the device going had failed. I was so disgusted I had arranged for a refund. Once I arrived home from work I plugged the device in using the 10 watt charger from my old 2nd generation iPad. Within a few minutes the Apple logo came up and the unit began the set up sequence. I've been using it ever since. My question is this, does Dealfisher not realize they are providing the wrong charger!? I think they do. I have read many reviews since my purchase, and I see many reports identical to mine.

16784,B0775H5HJW,Kelly,4,21-Nov-19,True,iPhone X 256gb (Silver),"I was very nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but everyone in my 5 person family all needed a new phone at the same time. I knew that would be costly since we use Straight Talk and would have to buy unlocked phones at full cost up front. I am writing this review for all three phones I purchased from this seller, but I will only attach photos of the specific phone the review is attached to. 2 - iPhone X 1 - iPhone Xs Max All refurbished. The phones came well packaged in ""Certified Refurbished"" boxes. All phones are GSM or Fully Unlocked and all work with Straight Talk service. I was able to just transfer the SIM card they were already using to the new phones without service interruption. ***iPhone X 256gb (Silver): The back is flawless. The screen has VERY minor blemishes that appear to have been caused by over buffing/polishing the glass. Nowhere near bad enough to send the phone back. I mean... I got an iPhone X 256gb for $500. I seriously can't complain about that. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is a HUGE upgrade from my 12 year olds Samsung Galaxy S4 which was a hand-me-down to make sure she was responsible enough for a phone. To say she is ecstatic is an understatement. This phone gets an A- for the scratches on the screen and the fact that it was missing the sim card key. (Btw, the Silver looks more like white.) iPhone X 256gb (Space Gray): The screen is flawless. The back has extremely minor wear and tear scratches. Nothing a case won't cover up. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is an upgrade from my 16 year olds Samsung Galaxy S7 which was a hand-me-down because he broke his old iPhone 5 (Don't let your kid put their phone in their backpack with heavy textbooks!). He is so happy to have a ""new to you"" iPhone. This phone gets an A++ for having all promised parts and better than expected condition. You can't beat a price of $520 for this condition either! iPhone Xs Max 256gb (Space Gray): This phone had wear and tear scratches all over. Like they never used a case, but never dropped it either. This one was bought for my husband. He chose a refurbished Xs Max over the new 11 Pro Max because as a firefighter, he is extremely rough on his phones. $700 was way better than $1,500. He upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Other than the minor cosmetic issues, this phone has exceeded our expectations. It gets an A simply because of the cosmetics, which wear easily covered with a screen protector and an Otterbox. Over all, I do recommend this seller. And if you want to save some money, or you're buying a phone for your kids who will more than likely break it, don't be afraid to try a refurbished phone.

19180,B07D42T6MB,"Don Quixote, et al.",5,21-Feb-19,True,"Took a risk on ""Amazon Renewed"" and so far, very pleasantly surprised and relieved","[NOTE: This is an initial review, and I'm very happy. If anything changes, I'll update the review later.] I've had both good and bad previous experiences buying refurbished/restocked items at Amazon and elsewhere. It's a risk, and I always make sure I have the option to return the item. This time, it appears I've lucked out, in a VERY good way. I should note that I purchased from the seller ""Prime Mobility"" and can't speak to whether other sellers are as good. I chose this seller based on the number/percentage of previous positive reviews. I debated whether to buy this iPad Pro via Amazon Renewed. I was a little worried about some of the problems previous buyers mentioned in negative reviews (for all sellers). But in the end, the HUGE cost savings were worth possibly being inconvenienced by needing to return a bad item. I bought the iPad Pro 9.7"" with the additional cellular functionality AND the 256GB hard drive. These same specs currently cost $700 through Apple's official Certified Refurbished Program (and they don't have the Space Gray color I wanted). I was able to get it here for under $400, which was insanely low and worth the risk. The item arrived in a generic brown box (not Apple-branded), but was very professionally packed and protected. I didn't know what to expect, but honestly was really, pleasantly surprised. If I hadn't known it was sold as refurbished, I wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't new. It didn't look just acceptable or good: it looked actually brand new, as if I'd gotten it from Apple. No scratches, dents or even dust/fingerprints. It's fully possible this was an Open-Box item that has never been used, and was just repackaged. It even came in the same custom, form-fitting plastic packaging sleeve Apple uses, which increases my hunch it's never actually been used. Maybe I just got lucky, but I'm not complaining. The ONLY small negative was that it came without any initial charge, and a correct but unimpressive third party charger, but that's NOT a big deal if you're saving over $300. When I placed my order, I'd also spent $15 on a very high quality Anker charger and cable, so was prepared, and just charged it for a couple of hours before set-up. Reviewers complaining so much about the chargers need to realize how cheap good replacements are, and that this is a very small matter compared to the massive savings on the tablet. You should always have an extra charger anyway, so just buy a couple of good, cheap spares. Setting up the tablet has gone perfectly, and I had no trouble updating to the newest iOS, using the fingerprint sensor, setting up wifi or installing my cellular data SIM card. Everything seems to work perfectly (I checked every function to be sure), and it runs like an iPad straight from the factory. For all intents and purposes, I now have a a tablet indistinguishable from a NEW iPad Pro or a certified refurbished one from Apple. I'll update this review if any problems arise in the next month, but so far the item has me confident this won't happen. I'm very glad I took the risk of buying this refurbished/renewed, and was able to get the tablet for a huge discount.",17.0,Apple,Apple iPad Pro 9.7in 256GB Gold WiFi + 4G Cellular ( )(Renewed),https://www.amazon.com/Apple-9-7in-256GB-Cellular-Renewed/dp/B07D42T6MB,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mwwot4zlL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D42T6MB,1,0.0,0.0

But hes only had it a few weeks and it dies so fast! And when it gets down to 15% it will just turn itself off. You can turn it back on and it'll say it still has 10% now and will work for sometime but continue to cut itself off whenever it feels like it. The finger print scanner also works when it wants to.

It’s also effecting typing things in- for example the unlock screen types in wrong numbers for password and we now are locked out of the phone. This has happened 4 times- you go to type in the first number and it inputs more than you type and then locks phone. We’ve been locked out several times now. Definitely a screen issue. UPDATE: amazon and seller weer both extremely responsive. It was backed by an amazon guarantee, but seller responded immediately and allowed us to return and we got a full refund. I elected not to have another resent- We were aware it’s a refurbished product so another *might* have been ok, but we decided against trying again at this price.

So, you may want to look for that when ordering. I now have a MintMobile sim in the phone and it works on T-Mobile towers. I’ve had no issues so far and was happy for the price I paid $584.

But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too.

This order was advertised as an Amazon Renewed product which ensured a real, working product. Mine came a day later than the 2-day shipping but I did not mind too much. The package came with an off-brand charger and no headphones but I was not worried about that either. The issue with the order was the actual phone itself! It was actually not GSM unlocked but ""Verizon"" unlocked. I was so fed up trying to get it connected to my current carrier (over 3 phone calls and two hours later) that I took it to a Verizon store to get connected there. I was not happy to have to switch carriers completely but I was desperate to have a working phone by then. Once I got to the Verizon store they looked at the top left of the screen and said it did seem like a Verizon phone as it says ""VERIZON"" by the Wifi icons. However, when trying to set up service they ran the serial number and found that this ""Verizon"" phone was unrecognizable. After I told him this was my THIRD TIME trying to connect this phone with a carrier he advised that I return it right away. It seems I was either sold a locked or a FAKE phone. My boyfriend's iPhone 7 from a different seller works fine, is great quality, and was easy to set up. Do NOT buy from this seller. You will be wasting a lot of time!

Buying this phone was a great deal especially since it is going for a much higher price (granted I was a little skeptical). I was able to set it up with no trouble. The only way I can tell it is not a new phone is if I go into the iPhone settings, then general, then about, and then look at the model it says NQCL2LL/A instead of starting with an M (which means new).

However, when I switched my phones with my carrier (MetroPCS which uses Verizon cell towers), I got a ""No Service"" message in the top left corner, where it should have said MetroPCS. Did lots of researching online, called Apple, who said it was probably a bad SIM card. Suddenly, an hour later, the phone started connecting to the cell tower. Great! I thought. It worked just fine for a few hours, and the phone showed ""No service"" again. I tried factory reset, connecting to Apple Store through my laptop, lots & lots of time troubleshooting. After a Google search, I discovered that iPhone 7 A1660 models had a problem antenna, which Apple was fixing for free when the phones were first manufactured (up to 3 years).

A couple gripes, the earpiece was so caked with crud that I couldn’t even hear. Spent an hour scraping yellow crap out of it, it’s finally about 30% open and semi usable. The battery was at 60% health according to the system settings. Lastly they slapped a very low quality screen in the phone and called it good. I have 3 light spots where the panel seems pinched or something and the pressure touch only works on about 1/3rd of the screen. Now here’s my problem with all this, if I had purchased a “certified pre owned” phone (like the box it came in said) I would probably expect some of these things.

Took about half a day of swapping SIM cards and going to Verizon Wireless to find out the phone is a GSM only phone and would never work on the Verizon CDMA network. We ordered it almost 3 weeks ago and the website is still inaccurate and claims this phone will work on Verizon.

21875,B07KFNRQ5S,Alexis Argueta,4,15-Feb-19,False,Review,"INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I’ve also had Androids and many different types of PC’s. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it’s the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won’t always need to carry your charger with you.

11546,B01N9YO1DS,Debra Shek,5,14-Aug-19,True,CAN BE USED ON ANY CARRIER ESPECIALLY VERIZON (NOTE: CARRIER MUST BE GSM COMPATIBLE),"I bought this for my network VERIZON and worked flawlessly, BUT you have to have a sim card, if you dont, you have to go to verizon and have them get you one. I saw A REVIEW on here that says not compatible with VERIZON, this is untrue, because she said she was on the phone with verizon for an hour. I know that shes wrong because there is no need to call verizon, just take the sim out of your current phone and pop into the iphone, and boom done. If you dont have a sim, you have to GO to a verizon store, they CANT give you a sim over the PHONE. ALSO here is another tid-bit of information for you - Yes it does, I myself have verizon, and it indeed works. Also, just for your information, 'Unlocked"" means it will work with any carrier. Also another tid-bit of information, any iphone after the 5s, I mean any iphone after 5s, on any carrier can be taken to any other carrier. For example, lets say I have a Sprint unlimited plan with an iphone 6s Plus, that iPhone 6s Plus can be taken to any other carrier and activated (because its an iphone thats later than the iPhone 5s). Oh and also of course assuming that the phone has been paid in full, because if you do one of those payment plans with the iPhone where they take the cost of the iPhone and divide it by 24 and then add that to your monthly bill, that iPhone cant be taken to any other carrier (even if after 5s) until its been 2 years and been paid on monthly or its paid in full at the time you want to take it to another carrier. Now back to my example, and assuming the iPhone is paid for in full, and lets say I am selling my sprint phone to you (and you have verizon) I would sell the phone to you, and you would then go to sprint yourself, and say i just bought this phone, its been paid in full, and i need you to ""release it from sprint"" so i can take it to my network verizon. And then badda bing your home free, and after that, that iPhone is now ""unlocked"" and can take to your carrier, and then if you were going to sell the phone again down the road, whoever you sell it to would not have to do what you did, because once you did it, the phone became ""unlocked"". So if its an iPhone 5s and later, it is unlocked and can be taken to any carrier no matter what carrier it was used on prior.

9248,B01GXAT0CE,Victoria C.,5,14-Aug-18,True,"Excellent refurbished (or new??) iPhone se from vendor, Breed","First,and important when you are considering a refurbished item, the vendor of this phone was Breed. The vendor is all-important, as they are sometimes the refurbisher, other times, they chose the refurbisher. The quality of the repairs and what sorts of phones are passed on to the customer depend on the refurbisher and the vendor. Please, folks, when you order through an Amazon vendor, mention the name of the vendor in your review. This will help other shoppers to identify which vendor you received good or bad products from, and who was responsible. We have had this refurbished 16 gb iPhone se for two weeks now, and it is an excellent replacement for my husband’s iPhone 5, which he had lost (the previous phone showed up behind the bed in a motel room we had stayed in, after nearly a week, so we were able to use the sim from our previous phone). The se model phone is a wonderful replacement, and was in like-new condition, with a Verizon sticker on the back. We took it to t-mobile to be sure it would update and transfer all settings etc from the previous phone, and the CSR could not have been more gracious and helpful. After two weeks, it is clear, the condition and performance of the phone are as good as the phone’s appearance. It arrived with a new, non-Apple charger and cable, but that is fine, we still have the charger from the previous phone, and have replaced our cables with lifetime warranty Anker cables (also available on Amazon - read the reviews). We are pleased with this phone, and would not hesitate to order refurbished equipment again from this vendor. I will mention, our iPhone 5 is still in great condition, after 4 years. It really does help to get a good case and screen covers for the phone, as they provide excellent protection from the inevitable bumps and falls.",76.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 16GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Unlocked-Phone-16GB/dp/B01GXAT0CE,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6165FLUs1+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01GXAT0CE,2,133.55,0.0

15744,B07643YNY8,rwrife,3,13-Jan-19,True,"Good phone, questionable reseller.","The actual iPhone SE is an amazing phone with near iPhone 6s specs, this review is more for the reseller and Amazon’s “refurbished” status. I got my order fulfilled by Bluetek Intl and it was listed as “refurbished” I’m not sure of their exact refurbishment process, but it looks like they take the phone as-is and just remove the SIM card and not actually do anything like attempt to clean it. The phone itself appears to be functional and unlocked as advertised. The phone’s screen has mostly minor scratches and one somewhat noticeable scratch...kind of expected for being refurbished. The case however has several scratches, small dents and scratches...most could overlook the condition, but it’s prettt close to sub-par. The biggest issue I had with the shipment was that the phone was physically dirty (maybe fecal matter) and I had to thoroughly clean the device before I felt it was safe to be handled....easily something that should have been done by the reseller. The other issue is that it looks like the screen was removed or replaced and improperly installed, resulting in the phone being 1mm thicker at the top vs the bottom, may be a non issue but most cases won’t fit now and there is a potential fire hazard since the battery may have been improperly tampered with.",8.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 32GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-GSM-Unlocked-32GB/dp/B07643YNY8,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71giJu0m0JL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07643YNY8,61,151.79,249.99

The charging port is still tight and the buttons click effectively like ON/OFF and Volume. However the screen is well used. In my experience with refurbs they always replace the screen. This one has wear. Sort of like buying a really mechanically sound used car whose paint is melted off and the seller ignored it. It is a 64gb phone so its an ok deal. A screen that didn't suck would make it four or five stars. Really odd because the camera lens appears to be new and if you opened it for that why not replace the glass. Used an otter box with a wireless charger. The ballistic otter box and wireless charger go well together and the phone charges fine.

However, as a college student, I couldn’t afford to buy straight from Apple so I checked OfferUp and letgo, and when those seemed wayyy to sketchy I came to amazon and found this. It took me a week to finally come to terms on buying a refurbished phone off the internet, but I am so glad I did! First off, the battery life is ridiculous; I charge my phone about every TWO days. Also, unlocked made it really easy to switch to metro pcs. I love the Live Photo’s! I love the size (I have small hands, but with a pop socket, it’s perfect)!

There is one small scratch to the screen, barely noticeable, and no dents to the device. The iPad was well secured in a brown cardboard box, with plenty of foam and plastic wrapping. The iPad was a 15% charge when it arrived, and booted up without issue. One thing to note, the charger that came with the device is NOT an iPad charger. That doesn't matter to me, as I already had one at home anyway. The iPad charged up as expected and without issue with the charger I had at home. The device comes with a 90-day warranty through DealFisher, but as far as the Apple limited warranty, my device's coverage was already expired. Not a big deal, IMO, to save over $100 on the insanely priced iPad Pro both new and refurb on Apple's website.

You'll be the judge about MINIMAL COSMETIC DAMAGE, see photos below (all 4 corners). And I can see the damage from 6 feet away.

Very disappointing, particularly since I bought a renewed phone a couple of years ago that was absolutely spotless. Oh, yeah, for full disclosure, the phone seems to work... UPDATE: after about 1 hour of use, the phone started to heat up near the camera area (and I mean real hot), and a volume control pop-up randomly appeared on the screen with a strong buzz. Looking at settings, a message says: ""your battery health is significantly degraded"". And the vendor promised ""over 80%"".

12249,B06XRJQX91,Niki Abram,5,11-Feb-19,True,"Fantastic phone, fast shipping and a great price!","**UPDATE March 3rd, 2019** So the phone itself works very well I’ve had only minor issues with it and that’s what I am writings of it about. The touch ID sometimes is not responsive and sometimes I have a hard time actually engaging the dictation button. I’ll tap directly on it and it won’t register me touching it but it will register the emoji key and the space key right next to it. I’ve also run into issues with the battery. The phone will randomly shut itself off around say 10%. It doesn’t do it every time, it’s completely at random. When I try to power it back on and it will show the empty battery with the power plug and red bar at the end of the battery saying that the battery is dead. However, when I go to plug my phone back into a charger and power it up, it will say that it is actually at say 40%. I can’t say I’m too thrilled about spending $80 to have the battery replaced. Amazing phone for a great price! It arrived quickly and has no blemishes on it whatsoever. When it did come in, it was dead so I had to plug it in but within 5 minutes or so, it was up to 4% and I was able to power it on. I was moving from Android back to iPhone and try to use the Move to IOS app but it didn't work out too well. I doubt that is an issue with the phone though. The battery lasts several hours with heavy use and when it gets low, it charges back up very quickly. The network I use is Straight Talk which uses Verizon's towers and I was able to get it set up very quickly. It does not come with a SIM card so you will have to buy one for your provider. However, it does come with a SIM card tool which is like a little pin to eject the SIM card slot. If for some reason it doesn't come with the tool, you can easily use a push pin just keep in mind the SIM card slot comes out all the way. It does have a sticker on the back with the serial number and the IMEI number which doesn't come off cleanly. I used Goo Gone to remove the residue and it cleaned it up nicely.

It came in a plain brown box, with the protective film on the tablet like you would find on a new one. The charger is a ""Sharkk"" brand unit. That part is ""junkk."" The iPad arrived with a dead battery. It didn't have enough power to start. I plugged in the charger, and I was concerned because the tablet didn't seem to be charging. However, I kind of expected that, having read several Amazon reviews. The output is 1A. I switched to my 2.4A powered USB hub that I use to charge everything else. Much better. I left it and went back to work. It was fully charged when I returned. I've been installing all my apps and the iOS 11 update, and I ran some benchmark tests just to watch it annihilate my older Galaxy Tab S. The battery is 85% after all that, so it's good. Before ordering, I was concerned about scratches. Mine is flawless. I inspected it carefully and couldn't find a single blemish. I will just have to buy a stronger charger. So for 445 (with next day shipping), I got a perfect iPad pro that would otherwise be significantly more expensive. I'm pleased with this purchase.

Doesn’t have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that’s to be expected since it’s refurbished. The box also said that it’s a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I’m using it so don’t really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that’ll blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it’s a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works.

I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it.
