20891,B07HK4JNV1,Trish,5,9-Mar-19,True,I. Love. This. Phone.,"I've been dying to write a review on this phone. I've never been this happy about a phone. Ever. First of all, my previous phone is a Huawei Honor 5x. It's a decent phone, but because I'm a heavy user of social media, various apps, etc., it began to lag terribly over time. It was time to find a new phone, and I did a LOT of research before deciding on this one. First, aesthetics: This phone is beautiful. Mine is black and it has a sleek, expensive look. I love the shape of it, and it fits well in my small hands. My old Huawei looks so clunky next to it. I like that the app widgets are small, too. The screen is large and gorgeous. The phone also comes with a silicone case. Second, overall performance: This thing is FAST. The phone is very responsive, and I don't have to wait for a page to load, or to open apps. I'm in love with how streamlined it is, and how easy it is to figure out. I was looking at my mom's new Samsung J7 Crown the other day, and I didn't like its setup at all. It made me appreciate my Xiaomi even more. The battery life is awesome. With modest use throughout the day, I've often had more than 50%, even 70% at the end of the day. I also like that on the battery indicator it shows an actual number indicating the percentage of charge left. Third, camera: I haven't used the camera much, yet, but I love it so far. I love the time-lapse and slow-motion features, and was giddy when I discovered it even has tilt-shift! I'm an amateur photographer, and I've done many tilt-shift images by editing them in Photoshop. So this was a bonus. It also has a Portrait mode. I will tell you that the Portrait mode does not create a true portrait photo. It blurs the background of your subject, and it does a very good job of it. You may see a little blurring around the edge of your subject, which would not be present in a photo done with an actual camera. It is much the same as doing it in post-production in Photoshop or another program. Still, it's pretty cool. The overall photo and video quality is beautiful and sharp. I suggest to anyone who wants to use the zoom feature...don't. As with any phone with digital zoom, you will lose the sharpness of your photo any time you use digital zoom. If at all possible, take the photo of a far-off subject without the zoom, then crop it. This phone does a nice job of getting great detail from a distance, so once the photo is cropped, it will look much sharper than if it had been taken using the zoom feature. I also discovered, accidentally, that I can use the volume button to snap a photo, which is nice. The video quality, as well, is very nice. And you can snap photos while shooting video. It shoots in 1080p, and I've read that the Note 7 Pro that is coming out will shoot in 4K, but 1080p is nothing to sneeze at. I'll still be able to produce some nice videos for Instagram, etc. This phone has a gyroscope, so you can play Pokemon Go and other similar games with it very smoothly. However, I just started playing Jurassic World Alive, which is much like Pokemon Go, and I can't use the AR function within the game. The phone is not supported at this time. It may work with Pokemon Go, though I haven't tried it yet. It may be dependent on the app itself. The sound quality on this phone is great, too. I often use my Soul Emotion Bluetooth earbuds with it, and it's loud and clear. Even without them, the volume is really good and not at all tinny. I also discovered that this phone has an IR blaster, so I'm able to control my Roku smart tv and Samsung blueray player with it. I lost my blueray remote forever ago, so I was stoked to be able to use my phone to use all the functions. It was super easy to set up. I also can cast whatever I'm doing on my phone to my tv, so I've had some fun with that. I talk to my granddaughter via Facebook Messenger video chat, and sometimes I'll cast our session to the tv. If you don't know how to do it, just go to Settings, then More, then Wireless display, turn it on, and if your tv is connected to your wifi network, it will show up below. Just click on it and in a few seconds you'll have your phone's display on your tv. You can watch Facebook videos, look at photos on your phone, etc., if you want to. It's pretty neat. I haven't tried the Face Recognition or Fingerprint features yet, so I can't speak to how well they work. Oh, another nice little feature about this phone I love is the volume control. When you click on the button, the controls pop out from the right side of the phone and there are two separate buttons. The top one is to operate the volume for videos and such. The bottom button turns off the volume for notifications and ringtones. I love this because I can immediately silence them without having to go into another menu to turn down what I need to, one by one. This is great when I'm at work and forget to turn off notifications. I can do it at a touch of a button, and turn it on just as easily. Finally, I use Straight Talk, with a T-Mobile sim card. I've had no issues with calls or texting. However, I never talk on the phone, so I can't touch on whether there are issues with dropped calls or problems receiving or making calls. I've tested it a few times, and it worked just fine. As for texting, it works perfectly, and I can easily send photos and videos. I did have to get a new sim card because my old phone used a micro sim, whereas this phone uses a nano sim. I also was able to transfer all my apps that were stored on my 32gb SD card flawlessly to this phone. I think I've covered everything. At this price point, you can't beat the features and functionality of this phone. I needed more internal storage and ram, and with 64gb of internal storage and 4gb of ram, I know I won't have to worry about the lag I experienced with my previous phone. It only had 16gb of storage and 2gb of ram. That's fine for a casual user, but for me, it wasn't enough. I'm super happy with this phone. There are more expensive phones out there that don't offer all the features packed into this one. Get. This.

20911,B07HK4JNV1,SHIJO JOSE,4,9-Jun-19,True,Phone bricked during firmware upgrade. - There is a way to fix it.,"I bought this phone based on reviews at Amazon. Yesterday phone prompted for a firmware update and I said ok to update. After the update phone does not turn on. Called amazon tech support and xiaomi with no luck to revive the phone. I remember the firmware upgrade showing about 52 % then suddenly phone went off by itself as if the firmware upgrade aborted or something. amazon will give a refund for phone. sending it back. Never used the phone. Did not even put a sim card in it. Was getting ready with latest software and then this happens. Shouldn't xiaomi do some check sum for they are pushing bug free version of firmware to playstore and shouldn't phone verify the firmware it downloaded is good before it is applying ? There were several warnings not to touch power button during firmware upgrade. But what to do if phone goes off by itself during upgrade and becomes a brick by itself. My first and last purchase of Xiaomi phone. Update 06/11/2019. I am changing my review from 2 star to 4 star because the hardware of phone really is good only the firmware upgrade over the air went bad and bricked it - however there is a way to fix it. I did some google searches and found good copy the firmware is available at https://en.miui.com/download.html downloaded Redmi Note 6 Pro Latest Global Stable Version Fastboot File Download to my computer. Also downloaded the MIUI ROM Flashing Tool to my computer and installed it. Installed winzip and uncompressed the firmware. Pressed power button and volume down button together on phone to get fast boot prompt on phone. Connected phone to computer, via USB cable, ran the flashing tool, selected the source directory where uncompressed firmware is located. Then clicked flash button. This tool flashed or replaced the damaged firmware on phone with a good copy of firmware. It took a several minutes. But phone booted fine and good since then. https://en.miui.com/ website has all these instructions how to manually flash the firmware but you need some back ground too for doing this. Anyways happy that phone case and screen protector that i bough for this phone does not go waste if I were to return the phone for a full refund. Told Amazon I am keeping the phone. It is on Andorid 10.3.3.0 Stable and going forward I will not ok to auto update over air (wifi).

23572,B07PY52GVP,Mondo,3,9-Jul-19,True,"Fast, but MIUI (Xaomi's Android) is wonky","I expected very little of this $200 phone. I went to Best Buy and only phones over $400 felt like they would be any improvement over my dying HTC One. The specs on this looked fine and I really don't care about phones so the price was right. I was immediately impressed with the build quality, and once I navigated through the landmine of advertisement checkboxes during installation, I was impressed with how snappy it was. The battery charges super fast and holds out for two days of use for me. Fingerprint scanner works great and is in the perfect location. Came with a clear silicon cover, a US adapter, and USB-C cable (white). But, something just isn't right with the 'MIUI' implementation of Android. There is no indicator light, so you'd have to rely on the lock screen to know if you got a text or call. But, things only randomly appear on the lock screen, maybe 2% of the time. The notification bar doesn't display app icons consistently either. Sometimes they'll be there, sometimes they'll disappear as you stare at it, but most of the time it's empty. I've yet to get an app to successfully show a heads-up notification, so maybe that concept just doesn't exist in Xaomi world. I've also given up on getting it to send notifications to my Fitbit; I can send test notifications from the Fitbit app but that's it. This seems to be a known issue, which I didn't consider searching for before buying the phone. If this ever gets fixed in a software update I'll pop back over and update this review.",4.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Black - Unlocked Global Version",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-Snapdragon-Black/dp/B07PY52GVP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaskM5hBL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PY52GVP,630,167.0,0.0

19544,B07FM9913M,Karl P. Boone,5,9-Jan-19,True,Amazing Phone That Rivals the Flagships,"I've had this phone for almost a month and I really love it. It pretty much does everything that the 1000$ flagship phones do for a fifth of the price. On a full charge, the battery lasts 24 hours easily for me. Keep in mind that I'm 20 and I use my phone quite a bit. The screen is nice quality, and the hardware is really pretty. I have seen some people complaining about the picture quality, so I have attached pictures that I have taken with the front and back cameras on the phone. I love the cameras and I think they are amazing quality pictures. The front camera does have some type of skin blurring effect, which I really love because I have acne scars. The only complaint that I can see with this phone is that it does have somewhat of an issue staying connected to 4G, and it doesn't have LTE at all. Also, it has no MicroSD slot, which made me sad because I had to manually transfer all of my old pictures onto my new phone. Other then those issues, which are slight in my opinion, the phone is really exceptional. The sound quality is nice and loud and clear. Runs fast and can handle a lot of tasks at once. I will be purchasing another phone from Xiaomi when this phone becomes obsolete in about a year or so.

26567,B07X5RRZFP,John Lalonde,2,8-Nov-19,False,Terrible experience - Xiaomi 9T Pro,"Where do I start? I’m in Canada. Phone works fine on Rogers 4G. Model: M1903F11G, 10.3.3 Didn’t auto upgrade to 11 (I heard nothing but horror stories about that upgrade). The charger comes in 2 pieces - they don’t fit together (Loose). The seller said he is sending me the smaller piece - it is supposed fit. I can’t wait for it to arrive (or not). I bought an Anker charger for $40. Anker is the best in my opinion. The battery drains like water going down a sink. I have read many blogs and chat rooms and done everything possible. Together with the battery it also can get hot - very hot. Why it heats up - who knows - again been on many forums that just have others with the same issues and no real answers. IF you buy this phone be certain you have all your passwords and info on your key apps. I have had a terrible time because when I had to reset the phone - not everything came back as the first time I loaded from google drive. I’ve spent 4 days with this phone trying to convince myself not to send it back but I’m loosing that battle. It’s been a draining 4 days, - hours and hours spent trying to get this phone operational. My old iPhone is looking real good right now. Update: I’m returning the phone. Again, the phone couldn’t hold a 100% charge overnight while not being used. Stone cold dead in the morning. Maybe 7 hours. This Experience cost me buying cases and glass protectors and cables for this unit. Absolutely did not want to have to return it but I can’t have a phone that can’t hold a charge and had heating issues.

There is no app drawer, no micro SD card slot and the face unlock feature is locked to only a few regions so it can't be used without rooting the phone for US buyers like myself. The phone is fast and I have no issue with the UI. However I did give it the google pixel 3 setup. The build feels and look good. I'm not a big camera person but the photos do look pretty good even when zoomed in. Charging the phone did not take long at all when I used a quick charger 3.0, but the phone does support quick charging 4.0. The reception for me in my area is great, I'm on metro and get band 2 or 12 most of the time. The only time I have issues are at work but I am in an area that's basically a building inside a building. Also you can use the internet while on the phone with the 4g network.

One thing though is that i am missing WiFi Calling (voice over wifi) but i knew that prior to buying the phone as it is a non tmobile phone. im loving this phone for $220 i think it is a super deal. the 48mp camera is on par with higher end phones, the picture quality is amazing. i came from a esential phone and note 4 and this screen/picture quality appears way better. i love the fact it has a IR Blaster and FM radio tuner! the blue outter shell case is very vibrant, it looks very nice but just a little too flashy for me, I wish i had bought the black one. The phone does come with a clear protective case but i upgraded it as the stock protective case it comes with isnt the best if your a person who drops your phone alot. The phone is fast, but i removed alot of bloatware as per instructions on XDA. I play a ton of newer phone games and they all run fine on the phone. ive gotten alot of complements on the phone as well from people and they ask what kind of phone it is! I tell them its a over seas china phone, which brings me to the fact that Xiaomi is a reputable company and i cant wait to unlock the bootloader and get on XDA!

I doubted to buy this cell because It's a first time for me using another device not Samsung, but I can tell, for the price you can't get a better device. I ordered a global version which means that I didn't have to install Android system. The device it's original. Unblocked so at the moment I inserted a SIM card I didn't have a problem at all. RAM is fast, frontal camera it's amazing, real camera, well, it's ok. About the battery, I was expecting something better, but at the end, I can recommend to buy this device if you need a fast cellphone, good quality, the screen it's big wich for me it's an advantage. Light, great design, I love this cell because I will be able to use it every time I travel. Unlocked with facial recognition and fingerprint scanner it's great! But if you need a facial recognition you need to setup to Hong Kong area. Cons.: You need to buy an adapter to use earphones and change the cell at the same time.

Screen: Excellent for its price and it is comparable to my wife's iPhone XS Max that costs 6 times more than this one. Speed: To start up an app like Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Walmart, Google News, YouTube, or others, each takes about 3-5 seconds.

It is great for the battery to hold out that long. Phone and speaker: Phone with Cricket service is adequate. I don't talk that much anyway.

Like no battery for a phone means u can't use it so even the best phone ever built if it does on you quickly is no use to u at all and this phone lasts me all day even tho I use it heavily. Did I mention the new Snapdragon 845 that this premium phones have is in this phone. Throwing My top games and this chip barely flinches. At this price like what else do u even need from a phone? Screen looks Crispy clear. Only Test I need to do is Signal Wize but that can't be fair since carriers are inconsistent with signal so I'll leave that to experts to rate. Anyways why wasn't so much money on a phone that's only going to last u like 2 years top. People have not realized that Battery lifespan is on average tops 2years. All phones cannot have the battery replaced by the user unless you have super phone powers and know what you are doing. So in two years you need a new phone so why pay 3 times what u already have. Until phones can have their batteries swapped by user don't care how long a phone is going to last since all phone now have a ticking time limit based on the battery. Quick math 1000$ at 2 years phones drop to about 450$ take in the insurance you are paying for an additional 360$ plus the deductible for having your phone serviced for a new battery u are left at this price point of the phone worth 350 or less.

23774,B07Q26V49K,Mr. T,5,7-May-19,True,Pleasantly Surprised with my first Xiaomi device. 4GB RAM/64GB,"Got this phone a week ago and was hesitant to leave my review so fast. Wanted to take my time and see how it would be considering it's my first time using a Xiaomi device. Got it to replace my Honor 8 and old Note 4. Have to say all my expectations and time spent researching the device and how it was going to work on T-Mobile etc paid off. This phone is amazing. Speed wise... It's VERY FAST! Doesn't slow down or hiccup at all no matter what tasks you do. Snapdragon 660 surprised the heck out of me. Throught it was going to run slow.... Nope! This processor is awesome. The Redmi Note 7 runs like a flagship device. Period. Camera takes very nice picture but transforms into a BEAST camera taking breathtaking photos using the free GCam app from the Pixel 3! The fingerprint sensor is the fastest I've used on any phone even faster than the Honor 8 and THAT sensor was ridiculously fast. Not sure how Xiaomi got away charging 200ish for all you get for this phone. The battery life is the best of any cell phone I've used. I've gotten 2 days average use between charges as advertised. But I've also gotten something they did not advertise.... 10.5 hours screen time between charges.... Not 10.5 hours of light use.... No.. 10.5 hours of web browsing, YouTube videos, 2.5 hours of calls, some pictures in between, social media etc... Normal stuff most people don't with their phones... Things that would kill my other phones at about 5-6 hours screen time on their best days... This device chews through like nobody's business. Reception with T-Mobile is awesome in the Chicagoland area. No dropped calls at all. The screen quality is also very good as well. It's gets bright, can be viewed outside without problems, has nice color/contrast and great viewing angles The speakers are loud and have clear sound. I find the MIUI software okay compared to Samsung's One, EMUI and iOS. Coming from any of those devices (Samsung, Huawei or Apple), you should have no problems working your way around MIUI. Once you discover using gestures to navigate, you'll wonder how you got around using other phones off the past. My device updated to MIUI 10.3.5 when I took it out the box. There are some privacy settings you'll probably want to turn off. Take time to go through the permissions and settings. Most you can turn off for privacy sake without affecting the functionality of your apps. Once you have your phone dialed in to your liking... Watch out. It becomes a very fun device to use daily. Watch Flossy Carter's Frankie Tech and TechUtopia's review of the Redmi Note 7 on YouTube. They're probably the best and most accurate reviews you'll find. Once you see them, buy this phone with confidence!

22485,B07N6N7JP3,Mota,3,7-Jul-19,False,Amazing phone crippled by cellular signal connectivity issues.,"I've owned the Mi Mix 3 for 5-6 months and I have developed a love hate relationship with this phone. I want so much to love it and except for one massive issue I do. The sad part is the massive issue is becoming a deal breaker and after i test it on other carriers and see no change it'll force me to purchase a different phone or reactivate my old phone. The issue is that cellular signal strength and connectivity wise this is the worst phone I've ever owned. I cannot maintain a signal for any period of time when stationary. Now this isn't entirely the phones fault as I am on t-mobile (metro) and almost equidistant from two towers. Given t-mobiles notoriously bad building penetration of their LTE signal and my rural location and the aforementioned tower locations I'm sure they share some blame. That having been said the problem is my other phones have been on the same network. As well as my daughter's phones. I've owned ZTE phones LG phones and the phone before this was a Huawei mate 9. My daughter has owned essentially the same devices except for when I bought the Mate 9 I bought her a pre-owned iPhone7. Since buying this phone I continually have to go in via the dialer code to set networks in order to stop the phone from constantly switching from LTE to 4g (3g but it's listed as 4g on this phone as 3g is outdated) which takes an eternity for it to finally grab a signal. It goes through every possible band several times before connecting to either the 3g signal or reconnecting to LTE. Neither myself or my daughter get even close to full bars but we can be sitting next to each other and I'll have a -118 - -127db signal strength and she will be at -100 - -110db. A prime example of how bad this phone is as far as signal goes is at the airport she had full bars of LTE and I had no service. That having been said I'll now delve in to the overall review. Build quality is amazing. And it is absolutely a stunner and conversion piece. You want your friends to lust after your phone this phone will do it. Not only because of the slider since other phones have more impressive solutions for hiding the camera (oneplus7 for instance) though it does turn heads. But the real attention grabber is the ceramic back. However I feel this beautiful part of the phone may be the causation of the connectivity issues (I could be wrong it could just be poor build quality in terms of antenna design but it's the first phone that isn't plastic or metal backed and it's the first with the issues as bad as this one has). The slider is rugged and I've no doubt that it will last as long if not longer than Xiaomi has stated. The screen is gorgeous and nearly 100% which is why I picked this phone. Performance is on par with flagships for the most part only falling slightly short but it's to be expected being priced at half the cost of the big guys. Miui is actually not a bad UI. I did root mine but haven't flashed a custom rom and I use Smart Launcher 5 in order to keep the screen clear of any icons widgets dots or any other items as I love a clean home screen. Overall I believe this is an amazing phone but probably best suited to someone in a city setting who doesn't venture out of the city very often if ever. Living in a rural area as I do makes this one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had. Obviously this phone is already outdated and will soon become obsolete once 5g is nationwide but if you want a quality built phone for a dang good price and live in a city or area with a strong cell signal, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option. For what it's worth I'd suggest the jade green it's absolutely beautiful though the ceramic back is slick and a fingerprint magnet. The includes case, while being cheap plastic, does a very good job of making it grippy. The wireless charger that is included is one of the best included accessories I've ever seen. Not super expensive but a nod to giving the customer the tools to fully utilize the phone as it is intended instead of creating a profit system built around having to buy peripherals and accessories to put the phone to proper use. I'm definitely impressed with Xiaomi and their dedication to building quality products at reasonable prices. I just wish I could give this a 5* but the signal issue is a massive problem. If I get it sorted and it turns out to be a network issue or operator error I'll happily bump it to 5*.",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi MI Mix 3 (128GB, 6GB) 6.39"" Display, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Unlocked Multi-Functional Magnetic Slider Smartphone w/Wireless Charging Pad (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Unlocked-Multi-Functional-Magnetic-Smartphone/dp/B07N6N7JP3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QLhYeA2+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N6N7JP3,79,0.0,0.0

20886,B07HK4JNV1,Sysy Imi,5,7-Dec-18,True,The best phone at this price point.. Period.,"For this price point, it is an amazing deal. Xiaomi really has done it again. Really fast midrange processor , paired with MIUI provides a almost iPhone level of smoothness. Battery life is amazing, with a monster 4000 mAh battery, this phone easily lasts for two days of charge. SOT (Screen on time) is about 7-8 hours of normal usage before the battery drains, meaning I could use this phone for hours and hours. Amazingly, T-Mobile LTE works perfectly on this device, and as well as 3G. Call quality is great, tons of memory, and a great screen makes this phone an amazing deal. There is even an option to ""disable"" the notch if you really wanted. For gaming performance, this phone is an absolute beast. PUBG Mobile, a very graphics intensive game runs smoothly at medium settings with no frame drops. This phone's chip is well cooled, and it won't fry your hand when playing intensive games. The snapdragon chip in here absolutely destroys other MediaTek equipped devices, and stomps on the older SD625. Good ROM support and a unlocked bootloader makes it very easy to ROOT and Mod to your liking if that is your thing. All in all, unbeatable value for a phone of this price.

20257,B07H41NB46,alex winetzki,4,7-Apr-19,True,Excellent phone but some minor glitches due to internation version,"The phone has outstanding features. Blazing fast, great screen, long-lasting battery, ample memory space. But it has an intrusive, hard to negotiate OS, many unsolicited apps which are hard, if not impossible, to uninstall or even stop, and needs some tweaks that will demand you go on google or specialized forums to find out about. One example is the face recognition system. I read about the feature prior to buying the phone, but when I got it out of the box, could not find it anywhere. After reading some blogs, it was said I had to change the country to India or Honk-Kong in order to use it. I did it, it works amazingly ( even in the dark ) So, a brief list of pros and cons: Pros * When it comes to hardware, this is easily the best deal in the market, and most sites in the world agree with it * Great screen * Unbelievably fast. I had a moto g5 prior to this one, and there is no way to even start to compare. Throw anything at it, open as many windows as you want, and it will handle it easily. * Lots of RAM memory, 128gb of space * Excellent sound ( i love music and have a senheiser PXC 550 as main bluetooth headphone ) * Crystall clear call quality * Finger ID and Face Recognition, but once the face recog is on, you will never need the finger again * Battery life is unbelievable. I use it through the day, heavily, and get to the end of it with 50-55% battery * 18W charger, so you get 25% charge in less than half an hour * The cable that comes with feels cheap ane is short, so I bought some 3 feet ankers Cons * Annoying, intrusive OS. I was used to the almost pure Androids on the moto G line, and the MUI that comes with this phone is full of stuff you don't need, so much stuff is hard to find the things you actually need Overall, the phone is so fantastic that is worth the weird software, but I have to take one star because of it",4.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Pocophone F1 128GB Graphite Black, Dual Sim, 6GB RAM, Dual Camera, 6.18"", GSM Unlocked Global Model, No Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Pocophone-Graphite-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07H41NB46,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q3UGwZhcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07H41NB46,237,314.5,0.0

23575,B07PY52GVP,Sayo,5,6-Jun-19,True,For those looking to cut down,"If you’re looking to cut down on your phone bill or tired of iPhones, this is what you get. I went through the trouble of selling my iPhone X to switch to this and I have 0 regrets. Made a profit on top of buying this device. So far this phone has exceeded my expectations. It is a lot lighter than I expected from the size of the redmi. The plastic trim connecting the glass isn’t that much of a shocker considering the price but that shouldn’t be a deal breaker either. The fact the phone comes with a case gave me a little extra piece of mind because the glass surrounding it is gorgeous. The phone is snappy for the most part. The only time I come across a problem with the software is when I open the camera app. It kinda slows down the phone a bit especially when switching through apps. I’m assuming it’s the transitions. Also, trying to connect to Bluetooth devices is a bit weird. I had trouble connecting to two different Bluetooth devices in the house(still managed to connect tho) but it wasn’t as quick as other phones. Took me a good 3 min to figure it out. The speaker should satisfy most people imo. And the screen is crisp and clean. YouTube premium has been a dream on this. I don’t think this phone has the HDR feature for Netflix like other flagships do tho. The UI gestures is pretty well done and the camera is pretty good. It’s no pixel but it takes some pretty decent shots. I’ll keep updating as the time goes by. Be aware tho, I paid extra for 1 day shipping on June 1st and didn’t receive the phone until June 6th. Regardless of that giant mistake(as I was phoneless for a week and missed work opportunities) the phone is so good I’m not going to worry about it.

26712,B07Y8XK9GC,PogChamp,4,6-Dec-19,True,Amazing phone for the price,"My older phone took a turn for the worse. I decided to give Xiaomi a try and thought the Note 8 Pro looked impressive for the price. I'm thoroughly pleased. Positives The phone feels solid. It has glass on the back. The fingerprint reader is quick. It works well on my carrier (AT&T). The signal has been solid wherever I've gone so far. The camera is solid for this pricepoint. Has a notification light on the front. Has NFC. The battery life is insane, especially after the most recent MIUI update. It can last two to four days easily depending on usage. The MediaTek chipset is no slouch. The phone is snappy and has run countless games without issues. Has SD Card support and an audio jack. The screen has HDR support. Negatives The phone is heavy, heavier than most phones. The fingerprint reader is right under one of the cameras. The screen while big and bright has lighting issues near the borders. Waterdrop notch on the front. SD Card slot isn't separate so it's either dual SIM or SD Card and a SIM. There's some odd video sharpening going on while watching videos. I'm not a big fan of MIUI. Maybe I should give it time, but I'd rather stock android. In conclusion, I don't think there's a better phone at this price point (when I ordered it, It was $210). Yes, Xiaomi's diverse lineup means you don't have to go much higher to get something better, but if your budget is ~$200 then this should be your next phone. Some of the negatives listed above are minor. I don't find the phone that heavy and have no problems handling it with one hand (although my hands are big). I've trained myself on the fingerprint reader's location to not hit the closest camera. The reasons for my 4/5 instead of a perfect score are video sharpening and MIUI. If you watch a video through an app, you will immediately notice that something is off. There will be visible artifacts depending on the source and things will look oversharpened. I don't know what's the cause of this, but I hope this can be fixed with a software update. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it might be for some who are more sensitive to this type of thing. MIUI, I'm going to say I'm not used to it yet. I'm not returning the phone over it since the phone performs well. I'm just not a fan of MIUI's style and how it shuffles certain things around. Since I've had the phone, it has received two updates so at least it's getting decent support so far. One more thing I should mention since I didn't notice it beforehand. The Mineral Grey listing here is the EU version. I'm not sure what the hardware differences are within the phone, but it came with an EU plug.",10.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro (64GB, 6GB) 6.53"", 64MP Quad Camera, Helio G90T Gaming Processor, Dual SIM GSM Unlocked - US & Global 4G LTE International Version (Pearl White, 64 GB)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Camera-Gaming-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B07Y8XK9GC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717jdCOqv6L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Y8XK9GC,148,216.0,0.0

26746,B07Y8YWTFL,PogChamp,4,6-Dec-19,True,Amazing phone for the price,"My older phone took a turn for the worse. I decided to give Xiaomi a try and thought the Note 8 Pro looked impressive for the price. I'm thoroughly pleased. Positives The phone feels solid. It has glass on the back. The fingerprint reader is quick. It works well on my carrier (AT&T). The signal has been solid wherever I've gone so far. The camera is solid for this pricepoint. Has a notification light on the front. Has NFC. The battery life is insane, especially after the most recent MIUI update. It can last two to four days easily depending on usage. The MediaTek chipset is no slouch. The phone is snappy and has run countless games without issues. Has SD Card support and an audio jack. The screen has HDR support. Negatives The phone is heavy, heavier than most phones. The fingerprint reader is right under one of the cameras. The screen while big and bright has lighting issues near the borders. Waterdrop notch on the front. SD Card slot isn't separate so it's either dual SIM or SD Card and a SIM. There's some odd video sharpening going on while watching videos. I'm not a big fan of MIUI. Maybe I should give it time, but I'd rather stock android. In conclusion, I don't think there's a better phone at this price point (when I ordered it, It was $210). Yes, Xiaomi's diverse lineup means you don't have to go much higher to get something better, but if your budget is ~$200 then this should be your next phone. Some of the negatives listed above are minor. I don't find the phone that heavy and have no problems handling it with one hand (although my hands are big). I've trained myself on the fingerprint reader's location to not hit the closest camera. The reasons for my 4/5 instead of a perfect score are video sharpening and MIUI. If you watch a video through an app, you will immediately notice that something is off. There will be visible artifacts depending on the source and things will look oversharpened. I don't know what's the cause of this, but I hope this can be fixed with a software update. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it might be for some who are more sensitive to this type of thing. MIUI, I'm going to say I'm not used to it yet. I'm not returning the phone over it since the phone performs well. I'm just not a fan of MIUI's style and how it shuffles certain things around. Since I've had the phone, it has received two updates so at least it's getting decent support so far. One more thing I should mention since I didn't notice it beforehand. The Mineral Grey listing here is the EU version. I'm not sure what the hardware differences are within the phone, but it came with an EU plug.",10.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro 64GB, 6GB RAM 6.53"" LTE GSM 64MP Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Global Model (Mineral Grey)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B07Y8YWTFL,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UgYuadkpL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Y8YWTFL,148,214.75,349.99

20297,B07H41NB46,Kyle,5,5-Oct-19,True,"After one year of use, here's my review","I bought this phone in early 2019, so I've had the phone for almost one year now. previously I had a Samsung galaxy s7 and really liked that phone. I didn't want to spend 800 on a new phone so after looking for a while I decided on this guy. So glad that I did. I live in Alaska so I was worried about getting a good signal. Not even a problem at all. On AT&T I get lte pretty much everywhere I go. I love some key features this phone has, like the lightning fast fingerprint scanner, the large display, the notch for the camera, the positioning of buttons, the dual sim capability, the 4000 mah battery, the liquid cooling, the 845 processor, and the build quality of the phone. It's a great phone and Ill take it over a Samsung any day, however there are a few things that knock off a few points, these include; issues with customization, (custom notifications and vibrations don't always work). Scanner can ""forget"" your finger. I have to re enter my print every few months, not too big a deal though. Peak brightness is a little lower than optimal in bright daylight. Flashlight is virtually non existent. Some missing features such as nfc. A weird awkward chin at the bottom of the screen. So there are a couple things that I would change but for the price this is amazing. I've dropped it several Times and it isn't cracked and still works perfect. It's not slowing down after a year of use. Stil over 90 gb available. Out of 128, plus a 128 gig SD card means I'll never run out of storage. The phone doesn't get hot either like my Samsung did. Even playing pubg mobile and similar games it stays at a good temp and the battery lasts forever. I've gone 4 days without charging before and I've never ever ran the phone to 0% battery. This phone feels great in The hand and isn't too bulky or heavy. Overall this is the phone to get. Absolutely happy with it. I recommend pairing it with a spigen case.

20159,B07GPNGWNK,Tristin Barttelt,5,5-Jan-19,True,Incredible quality and specs for the price,"First off, this phone feels amazing in the hand. The screen, though with a notch, is out of this world compared with older phones without OLED. Battery Life: Amazed me, my previous phone I needed to carry a battery band with me. But this phone lasted over 18 hours with lots of YouTube and Supercell games, along with general use. The quick charge capabilities are also very nice, but do note there is no wireless charging. Value: The value is out of this world when compared to other flagships from companies like LG, Samsung, or Google. It still lags just a little behind their own phone, the Pocophone F1, but as I am a T-Mobile user this phones band coverage worked for me. Notes: Make sure to check with your carrier to see what bands they support and compare with the bands this phone supports. Also the MIUI, though nice for simple users, is a kick in the face for power users. It is full of useless features that hinder the otherwise clean experience of the phone. I would recommend flashing a new version of android, something like Lineage OS, onto this thing. LinusTechTips made a great video on how to do this titled, ""The Ultimate Pixel 3 KILLER"".

They had us download a firmware update that was older than the one we already had. They asked us to use the phones built-in diagnostic software and make a video of the test. The test they asked us to run (""TOP MIC"") could not be found in the software on our phone, so we ran the two tests that we did find, each of which returned the ""FAILED"" response.

24305,B07QCCW5KB,Kou,5,5-Aug-19,True,Good budget phone,"Pros: Works as advertised, low cost, good price to performance. Excellent phone for the average users. Cons: No cons, it's a low end budget phone so don't expect high end features. If you want more, then you gotta pay more. Got this phone for my dad because I didn't want to spent much. This phone works just fine for him, he mostly goes on Youtube, makes calls, gets confused by emails and occasionally uses text. Review update: 9/15/2019. The 1st week of September my dad said the phone screen suddenly went black, the phone itself would not turn on. It was already over 30 days. I contacted Amazon and followed a few suggestions, but the phone still would not turn on. The Amazon reps via chat were helpful and sent a replacement. I received it Thursday 9/12/2019, prepped it, allowed the battery to fully drain to 0%, charged it to 100%, and now my dad is using it again. I'm hoping it was just back luck, and that the previous phone was just defective.

23555,B07PY52GVP,Joseph,5,4-May-19,True,Best $200 I've spent on a phone.,"I'm impressed with the Redmi Note 7. 🙂 I'm a true tech geek when it comes to mid-range smartphones. They are simply better and more worth your money for the price tag. Build quality: The Redmi note 7 is made of a ""plastic"" like material on the frame of the body and it is equipped with a glass back. It doesn't feel cheap by any means and it is a rather light phone compared to my old iPhone 8 plus, Moto e5 and lg v20. The front and rear cameras along with the finger print scanner and the main screen itself are all protected by gorilla glass 5. So you can be sure your car keys won't scratch or damage the phone. Performance: The phone is fast! The snapdragon 660 is smooth and impressive in many ways. I play multiple games (not pub g yet but I will test it and let you know if there is any game lagging). Without any lag and I run multiple applications simultaneously without any problems what so ever. Cameras: You won't be disappointed. 🙂 Just download gcam.apk through Google for the Redmi note 7 and it takes the cameras to new levels. I just use open camera for recording which it does beautifully in 4k@30 fps. The stock camera app isn't terrible, but it's also not the best especially with what these cameras can offer for such a low price. With a good update Xiaomi can fix minor problems, pictures come out more bland with the stock camera app compared to vibrant with the gcam app Battery Life: Is great, you will get a solid 2days with normal to heavy usage, including having GPS and cellular data on. Charging does not take long at all, I use a fast charging brick that supports 18w fast charge so it charges for me in a breeze. The charger it comes with is awful and I suggest you replace it/ have a new charging brick ready for when you order this phone. (Check Amazon). Connection: I haven't had any connection problems. I just downloaded Google messages from the play store because I used it with all of my phones and all of my messages were backed up and ready to go with ease. The phone connects to 5ghz wifi, NO WIFI CALLING that I know of right now, and no nfc but these are not deal breakers for me. The phone has a head phone jack and the single firing speaker on the bottom sounds pretty good. Also, by the USB type c charger there is a notification light right above it which I thought was a cool/neat feature. 4g LTE Network on the T-Mobile Network has been great with no dropped calls, call quality is crisp and clear. 05/21/19 Hey everybody 🙂 Just want to update on the use of the Xiaomi Redmi note 7 that I'm still using. It has still been a great phone! Battery life is great, and the fast charge feature to support fast charging up to 18w is an impressive and much needed feature. All apps run strong including Social media, YouTube, Netflix, and many others. I can scroll through the internet with multiple windows open and the phone just does it's job perfectly fine with no hesitation. Gaming: when it comes to gaming this phone does well, it does tend to stutter here and there playing PubG but that's expected from this phone. Connectivity: I still get really good service everywhere I go besides in large buildings like a warehouse, I lose service at almost every Walmart, Target, and Fry's, that I go to but connecting to their free WiFi with my VPN network I use allows me to still be able to use the phone if needed,but that can definitely be from the lack of Bands needed (even though the seller is saying this has band 4 and a couple other major bands needed for T-Mobile, don't believe it. It doesn't come with all necessary bands you need for the U.S. but it still gets the job done perfectly fine. Just Google your phones model number and you will see exactly what bands come with the phone. I have also been told by others that when they try to call me that SOMETIMES it forwards them straight to voicemail. I have done my research and it seems as the lack of Bands needed can cause your phone to not be able to receive calls or text messages in certain areas (maybe certain dead spots in your home or around town). This is not a deal breaker for ME by any means though, it doesn't happen often and when it does I receive a notification that I have a voicemail or I receive a text rather late (up to 10 min from what I calculated when my girlfriend text me to help her grab the groceries and she stormed in the apartment mad 😂). Could be that she has an iPhone though lol But all in all besides these small cons, the phone is still worth $200, compared to what else you can get at that price range. If you don't want to spend $1,000 on a phone then consider this one of your options. It's reliable,fast,great battery life,awesome cameras and 4k@30fps recording capabilities.

24409,B07QK32C8M,Daniel Woiwode,4,4-Jul-19,True,Great value but major flaw with the camera,"I love this phone *for the price* - you get a full 1080p screen, a whole lot of storage, a headphone jack (thank goodness.) But I take major issue with the camera, the way the camera is marketed, and its performance. Not to get too in depth here on technicalities, but we generally use a pattern in the world of imaging called a Bayer pattern. This alternated photosites between having a red, green, and blue filter over each, and the key is that no color next to each other is the same. That allows for processing called ""de-Bayering"" or ""demosaicing"" to resolve the image at one photosite per pixel. Well the ""48 megapixel camera"" camera may technically have 48 million photosites, but they're quadrupled up in color meaning you only get 12 megapixels of performance. In fact, due to spacing between photosites and how that limits light sensitivity, you actually get worse than the performance of a normal 12MP camera. This was clearly done mostly for marketing reasons which is really disappointing considering the image this makes isn't particularly great- and when you open up the camera app it looks like a joke to call it 48MP.

23578,B07PY52GVP,Honest Reviewer,3,4-Aug-19,True,Disconnects from AT&T service constantly - Do not buy for AT&T service,"This phone would connect to AT&T when first set up but as soon as you move to another location in a small city with AT&T service, it would disconnect over and over. People would tell me that my service was disconnected when they called me and data would simply stop working at any given moment. It was just not feasible to use this phone as a daily driver so I am returning it. DO NOT listen to ""top reviews"" that claim this phone ""works on AT&T"" because while it will connect to a couple of bands when you turn it on with an AT&T SIM, it will disconnect as soon as you go farther indoors, leave the house, go to work, etc. In other words, the statement ""works on AT&T"" just means ""it may connect from time to time, but won't work reliably on AT&T!"" These phone listings on Amazon should come with a disclaimer informing users that just because a phone is described as ""working with (insert carrier here)"" does not mean it will work most of the time. Overall, it's a good, solid phone with the best hardware you can find for under $200 , but it is NOT accurate to say it works with AT&T when it doesn't connect to AT&T most of the time. AT&T users should stick to getting AT&T branded phones if they want a working phone because phones like these, advertised as ""works with AT&T"" do not actually work as you would expect it to.

The green is rather striking with the glass exterior. It's easy to hold as it is long and thin. The phone is fast. It loads from powered off to ready for use in 15 seconds. The fingerprint reader is also rather quick. It has a vibrant screen, a screen that stretches over almost the entire face. The touch response is fantastic. Operation while running multiple apps is silky smooth. I scored ~278000 on Antutu benchmark, which seems pretty good (that's slightly better than a Galaxy S9). The camera is good, low light pictures come out nice. I don't use it but it has NFC. There is a small white notification light in the teardrop. The GPS is fast to acquire and accurate.

23749,B07PY52GVP,Jon D,4,30-May-19,True,No More Samsung For Me!,"This phone is really incredible for the money, and it puts Apple and Samsung to shame. It absolutely holds it's own against more expensive phones. The biggest thing you are going to be losing is the software. The software consists of the necessary and basic features of an Android phone. There aren't many of the special features that Samsung offers in their phones. For me this is actually another bonus. I didn't have to go through the settings for 30 minutes turning off features that I was never going to use. It's just a simple usable phone with great hardware and an eye-pleasing 6.3 inch display. There are two reasons that this phone does not get 5 starts. The first being that the back is made of glass. It is a well built phone but there is no reason that any phone should have a glass back. All this does is weaken the structure of the phone and make it considerably slippery (increasing the chance of drops and breaks). My last phone has a glass back and it was the only phone I ever broke because of it. In Xiaomi's defense, the phone does come with a free case to protect it and I really appreciate that. The second reason is the Mi UI. It's very basic. So much so, that it seems to lack some things. For example, I haven't quite figured out how to do a group text with the Mi texting app. After some research it seems like it might not even be possible, which is a little frustrating. Bottom line: If you are thinking about this phone because your current one is busted or you want a good upgrade for a great value, then just buy it.",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Black - Unlocked Global Version",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-Snapdragon-Black/dp/B07PY52GVP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaskM5hBL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PY52GVP,630,167.0,0.0

Gerard,3,30-Apr-19,True,"Might be a good fit for some people, but not me.","No headphone jack... which means you can not use a wired headphone or hook this to your car stereo without using the USB dongle. If you use the dongle, the phone can't be charging. That might be fine for some people but it does not meet my needs. When I plugged the phone in to charge and turned it on and connected it to my Wi-Fi and started downloading its update information, Google Drive kept crashing. There was nothing I could do to stop it. I would clear the pop-up notification and it would immediately reappear, making it very difficult to enter information for other apps that needed input. I have absolutely no doubt that if you deleted Google drive from the phone and reinstalled it from the Play Store it would have fixed the problem. However, I just did not have time to mess around with the phone to correct something that shouldn't have been a problem to begin with. The charger that came with the phone was European spec. Taped to the outside of the box was a US outlet adapter. An absolutely horrible setup for a a serious phone in the US. While the phone does come with 64 GB of of internal storage, as all of my apps were downloading from Google Play Store, the phone reported there was not enough internal storage space to install. Checking the phone's storage, it reported only 27% in use. To make matters worse, there is no ability to add a memory card. There is no external slot for memory. That was really the deal-breaker for me. If I couldn't install all the apps I had on my prior phone with less storage, then something was definitely wrong with this phone.

20035,B07G8VPHG3,Olivia,5,3-Nov-18,True,Amazing phone for a steal.,"Huge step up from the Mi A1, in a few ways. The most noticeable is absolutely the camera. I am a huge sucker for a good phone camera, but I am not looking to spend $900+ on a newer big name brand phone. This does the job and exceeds all expectations. The portrait mode is both front and back camera on this phone, and unlike the Mi A1, it does not zoom in on it's own for protrait mode which I found an annoying feature. The portrait mode is much cleaner and doesn't oddly smooth people's skin when you use portrait mode. Another thing I found annoying with the Mi A1 (I did however love that phone and used it for almost a year, until it sadly fell in the toilet. It didn't recover well.) This phone is sleek, responsive, includes updates and it is easy to restore everything from your previous phone. It came with a free clear phone case, and a charger. I bought this mostly because I loved the Mi A1 and I knew it delivered amazing photos, this however tops it. Camera is a huge deal for me, since I don't use any other way to photograph my children. And the Google photos app that comes with the phone is perfect for storing pictures. And printing out photos is crisp and holds true to the quality. My brother actually has a Samsung Galaxy s8 and I prefer this phone and it's camera to his. Sound is very good, loud and clear. If you buy this in hopes of a good camera, you won't be disap. It is easily comparable to the newer iPhone and the newer Galaxy phone, in function and in the camera.",21.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (64GB, 4GB RAM) 5.84"" 18:9 HD Display, Dual Camera, Android One Unlocked Smartphone - International Global LTE Version (Gold)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Lite-64GB-5-84-International/dp/B07G8VPHG3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lfpjOekDL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07G8VPHG3,149,154.49,0.0

It runs smoothly, takes good pictures, and works very well with my service provider (TMobile). It's better by leaps and bounds than my last phone, which was a Motorola g5 plus. The only complaint I have is that the headphone volume is quite low. I use my headphone jack a lot, because I prefer wired headphones. That's the only downfall I've seen so far, and I've had the phone for about 4-5 days. The processor seems good. It's faster than the snapdragon 625 in my last phone. I'm left with about 60% battery after an 8 hour day at work listening to Spotify the entire time. Thats entirely acceptable to me. Fingerprint sensor works as it should. If you set region to Hong Kong you can use the face recognition. I'm still getting used to the full screen gesture function, but it seems to work well. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

I ran on MIUI for a few weeks and it was just fine -- I still put a custom launcher (Nova Launcher is my choice) on it since I like a clean home screen. I have since rooted the device and run a custom ROM (Lineage OS) which is a much cleaner experience for me. I've seen reviewers complain about ads on this phone (as part of MIUI). I can verify that is the case. But it seems to be only in the settings screens and it's Xiomi advertising their products. Otherwise not actually intrusive. Just a little strange when you first notice it. Of course in my case this no longer matters since I changed the OS altogether. :) If you want a phone with great specs that'll run great and handle everyday use, runs games just fine etc., and don't want to break the bank... as long as you're not chasing the latest and greatest, this is a great option.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Mi 8, 6-64GB, Unlocked, Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-6-64GB-Unlocked-Global-Version/dp/B07GPNGWNK,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ITfSJQDAL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07GPNGWNK,60,268.99,0.0

21523,B07JMPGNHK,Jim C,4,3-May-19,True,"Bigger screen, light weight.","I bought this Xiaomi 8 Lite phone mainly for the dual-sim compatible purpose when I am travel overseas (owns a local number...etc). Even iPhone XR does allow dual-sim but one of the number has to be an eSim and that is not very helpful when I travel to overseas with an actual sim card. Here are my preferences about this phone: Pro: * Dual-sim cards (this was my main purpose for shopping my 2nd phone. * Easy to control which sim card (phone numbers) I want to use. Turn both on / off or Turn one on / off. * Screen is a little larger than my iPhone XR and resolution in Xiami Mi 8 lite looks sharper and brighter than iPhone XR. * Weight is lighter than iPhone XR * Front & Back Camera are 24 & 12+5MP and beats iPhone XR (7 & 12MP). * A phone case is included with the phone * Easy to set up and be able to easily sync my Google mail account to Android system. (Sync both info on my iOS and Android phones) Con: * TOO FRAGILE.... the phone slip out of my phone and fall onto the ground when I took out from the box. It is about knee height (2ft), and the back panel glass cracked. But since it comes with a phone case, it doesn't bother me on using this phone. * US plug is cheap made looks like been chewed up by a dog or cat.

20899,B07HK4JNV1,Joe Haynes,3,3-Mar-19,True,Not very compatible with T-Mobile/MetroPCS Networks,"From the surface this phone is a steal of a value, and it is. The screen is gorgeous, the UI is quick and snappy (but definitely lacks customization options), and overall very satisfying phone to use. However, the problem with the phone, possibly because of the global/international version, is it has very VERY POOR reception, unacceptably poor in fact. I have MetroPCS and in my area I see full 4GLTE signal on Metro's coverage maps, but even with my old phone this was never a reality so I know from experience what coverage I should be expecting, and this failed to even get close to that. I regularly have ZERO bars and no service, but have seen as much as up to full five bars but no mobile data networks available. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that either through Xiaomi or Metro, this phone has NO WIFI CALLING support. This a deal breaker. I legitimately cannot maintain a solid cell phone reception and the phone lacks the tools to remedy this. Like I can't even try to make calls, and if I do happen to have enough signal strength to do so, most calls so far have ended in the other person not being able to hear or understand me, or I lose signal entirely. I realize that each network is different and covers different perks dependent on phone, but as phone advertised to be compatible with these networks Xiaomi needs to be specific in which network bands they support, or at least create a version of their OS to be able to enable this functionality one way or another.

I set this phone up within 15 minutes and all my notifications work, I get no ads, and everything works perfectly on Cricket/AT&T.

The speaker is nice and loud, not very tinny, and had some decent mid-range sounds to it. Bluetooth works great, it charges up nice and fast, feels good in the hand, face unlock works great and I didn't even have to set my region to India to get that to work.

I wanted a global phone that could hopefully work well here as well as across seas. This phone has a choice of using 1 SIM and 1SD card or Dual SIM cards and is compatible with the service bands I need. I've traveled around the city and I always have a 100% bars with my signal so far. My old phone rarely did. I believe I will be just fine with the service bands it uses here and across seas when I travel. When the phone was delivered it had a 66% charge so I immediately paired it with my old phone and left it on the table alone while it transferred everything over, apps, accounts, phone calls, and text. It took around 15 minutes or less. I had the phone ready to go minus personal setup preferences in no time. The camera is absolutely the best I have had and can be opened up to do more than intended at this price point. The battery will last all day! I left the house at 8am and used it constantly through out the day for work. It's 6pm with 62% charge with no additional charge and screen display brightness at about 70%. AUTO display brightness is always to dark for me, no matter the setting. The battery may never ever need charging again at that setting....... but I'll never test that out though. Fingerprint reader works great. It keeps excellent Wifi connections. The screen looks great and the camera notch revealed doesn't bother me like I thought it would. Nothing I do slows down the phone. It would have been an absolute waste for me to buy anything more. With the rubber black cover that came with the phone it feels solid in my hand.

The default sms is so embedded in the phone with will not use the default sound for incoming messages using Google messages. I apsolutly hate that! It takes a little bit of configuring to not use some of their bloat ware on there phone. It can't be deleted. The launcher kinda sucks. PRO. The camera is good. It's a fast phone. The screen is crisp. The digitizer is quality. Does not feel like a budget phone at all. IT CAN BE ROOTED. I won't root because I use the fingerprint with my bank. Something to consider. I was an iPhone user so to get close to the same feeling but without taking away the functionality you gain with an Android, I downloaded Evie Launcher.

24102,B07Q6ZZ4S1,Alicea PortFolio,5,3-Jul-19,True,What Else Can I Say? I'm In Love!,"I was all set to buy the 64gb model of this phone new from Amazon but then noticed it was being offered in ""Used- Like New"" condition - but the 128gb model (so twice the space) from a third party but with fulfillment by Amazon (meaning it would still be eligible for Prime Shipping). Ever since I moved, I've had issues with products arriving, arriving on time or arriving without being damaged but alas, the pull of the free two day shipping is quite strong. The phone was shipped by the seller on Monday & I ended up receiving it the NEXT DAY! I've only had the phone since Tuesday and today is Monday but it's no exxaggeration if I describe myself as ELATED. First off the appearance: This phone is just undeniably gorgeous. I got the blue model and it's so lovely that I deeply regret having to cover it with a case! The manufacturer kindly includes a complimentary CLEAR, silicone case with your phone & I believe that is with the purpose of allowing the feel, lapis lazuli like Jewel tones to be visible. I appreciate the inclusion, and i may use the case as a back up but for someone like me who is clumsy and tends to drop their phone often, there are lots of durable, SHOCK PROOF case which I ordered ahead of time so I wouldn't be taking any chances. The specs on this phone are just out of this world for the price! 48 MP camera? Thats's like twice the MP's of my son's super nice DSLR he got for Christmas! The phone is also packed with a decent amount of RAM & it shows in the phone's performance. It's extremely responsive. The keyboard is a dramatic improvement over my previous phone just going by how well it picks up on what I want to type whereas my last phone was a nightmaren for typos since my finger would occasionally brush against the key next to the letter or # I was intending to type: Not so with this Redmk!With the amount of RAM in this phone you could play online games easily. Mobile games aren't exactly my jam but hey, if they're yours look no further Other than that, the screen is brilliant and the size is perfect. It is a substantial ""phablet-ey"" the phone. Videos are nice to watch because of the quality of the image/screen and as I mentioned above the size is substantial with a weight to match. You'll feel it when you take it out of the box that this isn't just some cheap plastic garbage but a well made, durable phone.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 128GB + 4GB RAM 6.3"" FHD+ LTE Factory Unlocked 48MP GSM Smartphone (Global Version, No Warranty) (Neptune Blue)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Warranty/dp/B07Q6ZZ4S1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51X1YcLSmXL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Q6ZZ4S1,272,186.0,0.0
24100,B07Q6ZZ4S1,The Pool Man,5,3-Jul-19,True,5 Stars for the Price,"This phone is part of a wave of Chinese phones that will help end the crazy Samsung and Apple prices. I got the 4GBs of RAM and 128GBs of storage model. 1. I have a OnePlus 6T. Those phones are known for speed. This phone doesn't feel any slower -- despite having a definitely slower Snapdragon. I'm sure in gaming it makes a difference but in everything else this thing is SNAPPY. 2. The bad news is lacks an AMOLED screen. The good news is it almost doesn't matter. You have to have a discerning eye to see the difference. In other words -- GREAT screen for the price. 3. Basically everything is good on this phone, except for -- 4. -- the MI software. It desperately wants your information. It tries to trick you to use their messaging app, their mail app, their contacts app. Just like Samsung. Like when you go to install an app from Google Play, a Mi 'security' app inspects it first. I'd like this were it not that it tries to trick you to download a different app during the process. So you'll have to hit Google to make it stop doing this. And learn how to make Google apps default. This is a major nuisance for naive users, but doable for experienced types. 5. The camera is a surprise. See my attached photos for a comparison between my OnePlus 6T camera and this phone. I would say the 6T is better, but not by much. I properly shows a bedroom lantern without washing it out. It recreates details of my cat's hair better. But if you look at the picture of the shelves, the photos on the shelves are sharper and the wall color is more accurate. Considering that 6T was more than twice the Note 7's price, that's pretty good. And get this: the shutter speed is FASTER on the Note 7. 6. The case that comes with it is an empty gesture. It's way too thin. When you buy a case make sure it protects the camera bump. 7. My charger is Euro with an adapter. It's kinda crazy big. If you're going to keep this phone (which you likely will) I'd recommend finding a cheap alternative charger. Word online is it supports up to Quick Charge 4 but 3 is recommended, since it will put less 'stress' on the battery while charging. 8. I had Cheap Chinese Phone Anxiety in the sense of build quality. I finally found someone on YouTube dropping the phone without a case. Go to YouTube and search for this ""Redmi Note 7S | 7 (Global) Durability Test (DROP SCRATCH WATER BEND) | Gupta Information Systems."" He's not speaking English but it doesn't matter. Get about halfway through and wince like crazy as he starts dropping the phone... again... and again... and again... without a case. Spoiler: it did really well. Overall: a WOW for this price.

26982,B07Z8BL2VW,John E.,5,3-Dec-19,True,Great value for ~100 dollars,"Bought this as a backup/travel device, been using it for a week before writing a review. Overall useful as a daily phone for most tasks outside maybe pubg or COD. Performance: This is the 2GB version and it's responsive enough to handle most web browsing in chrome or firefox mobile, hangouts video chats, Discord, and basic day to day office tasks you'd need for work. Everything feels quite responsive outside a few minor things I believe are bugs in the recent MIUI 11 update on the phone I am sure will be worked out, enabling wif/blutooth is a tad slow but works. If you aren't going to push this phone to gaming you should be fine for most all tasks feeling responsive. CPU is a bit weaker as this phone is geared at battery life over performance. Battery: With office tasks, ~2-3 hours of youtube 480p, discord, and some web browsing. I was down to about 20% after 3.5 days from 100%. This was with me enabling battery saver from 20:00-7:00 and using android dark mode, mileage may vary depending. Overall this is a perfect phone for anyone planning to be out all day and cares more about their phone lasting the full day(or two) than being able to game on the go. Features: Lacks NFC, Fingerprint, and some other things but overall it's not a deal breaker. Fast charging is nice, headphone jack, FM radio, IR blaster are as well; but this phone ships with a 10w charger for full Q.C. you can, and should, get an 18w charger as the battery will need it to go from 20%->100% in a reasonable time. Screen is not 2k but looks good enough even with full brightness not to be bad, it does tend to wash out a bit in full color but it's nothing offensive. Dual sim + SD card is really good for travel. Camera: This won't win any awards but for most pictures it looks and acts fine, plenty of reviews for the full images out there though I will say the latest update did fix a few things with quality. I hear you can also side load the gcam in but I haven't tried it yet. The camera is good enough to get the job done, the AI mode can help a few minor touches as well. If you're just going to share daytime pictures with people via social media, this camera will get the job done with ease but it's no pixel/hawuei camera. Overall good phone for travel or a phone for someone non-power user. Going to be using this on a few of my trips so that I don't need to worry so much on a power bank wherever I go.

20044,B07G8VPHG3,Krylos,5,29-Sep-18,False,Where did these Xioami guys come from with such outstanding value! I love Mi new phone!,"I will be reviewing this phone and making comparisons to the Samsung S5 which I am upgrading. I will also mention Mi A2 non-Lite version as well as LG phones. I usually upgrade when I feel like I can get a decent upgrade for $195 or less. This turned out to be a bit of an upgrade from the S5 with some notable trade-offs. This phone was recently introduced to Europe in July 2018, so I had to order it internationally to get one. My main reason for choosing this phone is that it had similar, but better specs than my old S5, and is one of the few phones around that retains my coveted IR Blaster AND sd card expansion. Requiring those features, significantly narrowed my options, however, in the end, I feel like this would have been a great choice either way. The price and features of this phone are AMAZING. I did buy a SquareTrade warranty to cover my back, just in case the phone turned out to be a problem. But after 2 months I have NO complaints. I chose the Lite over the non-Lite version, though I would have preferred the larger screen, it comes with a 20% SMALLER battery?? Very odd design choice. However, compared to the S5, I thought I was still getting a larger screen, I was somewhat incorrect. On the rare occasions where I am watching full screen video, it does seem to have a bigger picture than the S5. But in daily use, where the control bar and the notch are fully active, it is about the same size as the S5. Speaking of the screen, The display brightness of the S5 is much better, However having said that, I really do not have any complaint about the screen brightness or clarity of the Xiaomi unit. The battery life of the 4000mah battery seems to be amazing, I usually get 2 full days of use on a charge which includes listening to tuneIn 3hrs a day M-F. Loading antivirus caused a notable hit to battery life, otherwise I would have gotten 2.5 days. I am not a fan of disposable phones with non-removable batteries, so this was a huge leap out of my comfort zone to make this big purchase knowing it will be a paperweight in 2 years, but so far, it seems ok. Performance-wise the xiaomi Lite 64GB gave me double the RAM of my S5 and an octo-core CPU. The reason I prefer this Octo-core CPU to others is that it is a TRUE octo-core. Many phones try to Dupe you with the octo-core feature, actually providing you with 2 quad-core chips...a quad-core for hi-perf and a quad-core for lo-power usage. That whole idea just seems useless. This has an octo-core that RUNS AS AN octo-core at all times according to my research. Yeah, it uses more power, but I am all about more power when I still get 2 days of use on a charge...HURT ME! The SD/dual-sim combo slot is NOT an issue for me. When I want to change SIM, I just change the Sim and pop the alternate into the slot on my phone case for storage. No problemo. Another important aspect of any phone is its ruggedness. I do construction work. So far, I have managed to drop this phone twice on a tile floor (without a case) and not broken the gorilla glass. Also I have stored it in my pocket when my jeans were totally soaked with sweat and it still works. These were some of my biggest concerns, buying a brand that I didn't know, and a phone that is not promoted to be water resistant like the S5. I am thankful that the phone has shown itself to be quite resilient. This is where LG phones COMPLETELY FAIL and I'll never buy another LG, LG are garbage for rugged use. As far as the Vanilla Android, and the upgrade to Android 8.1, Ouch, that has been a 'Uge adjustment. Samsung included a lot of useful apps that I did not realize were Add-Ons! I had to download a flashlight, an alarm clock (samsung still has best Alarm clock IMHO), a photo gallery, a dialer, a keyboard! Gboard is USELESS. and a Texting app (Textra). This took about a week to try apps and get something usable. Lots of useless apps, as we all know. Then I had to load the LATEST version of the Apps from S5....BUMMER. Note, I always DISABLE UPDATES on my phones and PCs. I absolutely HATE opening a program where the interface and controls have TOTALLY changed from Yesterday! Ahhhhhg!...usually for the worse...""Change for the sake of change"" as they say. Just another exercise in frustration. ES explorer and TuneIn interfaces are now busy and cumbersome to use...that's progress?? At least Jota is the same. FYI, I don't even use the fingerprint scanner and don't care at all about facial recog and other unreliable bells and whistles that you pay $500+ for to be trendy. This phone has all the features I wanted and more for a pittance. Plus it seems to also be a high quality device.

23577,B07PY52GVP,Jerry L. Kreps,5,29-Jul-19,True,Excellent smartphone! WELL WORTH THE PRICE!,"07/29/19 My iPhone 6+ 64G smartphone, bought on Dec 29, 2014, began showing ""Touch Disease"" two years later. It got progressively worse and by the spring of this year was essentially unusable. It behaved like a daemon was randomly poking the display almost all the time. Only two things worked: it could still make calls, and after a few moments of flickering YT videos would usually play without problems. Apple refused to fix it and an independent repairman would have charged me $150 with no guarantees that it would work when he was done. I paid over $700 for that phone and was determined that I would never 1) buy another Apple phone and 2) never pay that much for a phone again. I would put that $150 into a new, better phone. Since last spring I've been checking around for more economical smart phones but while they were cheap they weren't getting good reports from users. A week ago I saw a YT video about the Remdi Note 7 and researched it. The reports and YT videos were raving over it. The AT&T rep said all I had to do was pull the SIM out of my iPhone and plug it into the Note 7. I purchased it and it arrived last week. I plugged my iPhone into my Kubuntu laptop and pulled off all of my photos and videos. I pulled the sim out of the iPhone and plugged it into the Note 7, and I had phone service. The ""LTE"" and signal bar appeared at the top of the screen. (Interestingly, even without the SIM my iPhone could send and receive text messages through the Internet.) The Note 7 had better connectivity in places where the iPhone signal strength was weak. I noticed that for certain features Xaiomi wanted me to sign up for a MUMI cloud in China, but those features are not important enough for me to do that. Instead, I put all the MI apps into folder and out of the way and relied on the Android 9.0 Pie interface, which is great. I've been using Linux for over 20 years and in many ways Android shows its Linux roots. Like Linux, I don't feel as handcuffed with the Note 7 as I did with the iPhone 6+ and IOS 12. I am currently perusing the Google Play Store for a good terminal that will give me a CLI. This Note 7 is considerably faster than my iPhone 6+. When I touch my finger to the sensor my fingerprint is read instantly and the display snaps open instantly. Apps appear almost instantly. Easily two or three times, or more, faster than my iPhone. My wife and I were watching a YT movie on the Note 7 and she mentioned that it would be nice if we could watch it on our 42"" smart TV. I turned on BlueTooth and it almost immediately listed our TV. I OK'd paring and there the video was, sound and all. That's going to happen a LOT more in the future! :D I was going to get a case for it but the silicone case that came with it is more than adequate and makes the phone easier and safer to hold on to. NOTE OF CAUTION about the charger: The wall charger is made for European electrical outlets. If you are in the United States you will need to get a USB charger rated at 5V and 2 amps. Note the amperage. TWO amps, not one. Most USB chargers are 5V=1A. So far I've used it less than a week and couldn't be happier about it. Money well spent. Sometime in the future I'll update this review to report how the phone is holding up. EDIT:. 8/15/29 I bought the Note 7 on 7/25/29, about 3 weeks ago. If I could give it 10 stars I would. I completely disabled AND stopped all MUMI apps, especially the ""peel"", when I discovered that it allowed remote control access. I replaced the MUMI cloud with Google's Drive, and it's browser with Firefox. The phone works great with Amazon's Echo dot and the Alexa app. All my smart devices and my Kubuntu laptop communicate easily with the phone. When the daemons start dancing on my wife's iPhone 6 it will get replaced with a Note 7. 8/8/19: Installed the Android SDK platform tools on my Linux Kubuntu 18.04 and enabled the developer mode, which allowed me to turn on USB debugging. That allowed me to use the Android debugging bridge (adb) to ""pull"" files from the phone and to ""push"" them onto the phone.

26570,B07X5RRZFP,James,5,28-Oct-19,True,A flagship-level premium phone for less than half the price,"This is one of the best phone values available. It has a high quality OLED display, the fastest Snapdragon 855 CPU and Adreno 640 Graphic chip, looks great and does away with the ""notch"" in the display that usually houses the front-facing ""selfie"" cam in favor of one that automatically pops up from inside. In terms of hardware, the only flaw is 6GB ram instead of the more standard 8GB. So far I haven't noticed that to be an issue, but the extra headroom would be nice. There is one other physical difference from most top-line flagships you should know about: Water resistance. It's rare on other phones in this price range, but phones with similar specs like Pixel 3 and Galaxy S10 are rated to withstand submersion in water about 5 feet deep for up to half an hour. The Mi 9t Pro does not have an IPXX water rating at all. However, one tear down review I saw that opened the phone did notice the same types of rubber bumper seals used in other phones to achieve water resistance, so it's possible this phone would endure at least very quick and shallow submersion. Considering the popup camera though, I wouldn't count on it if you accidentally leave it in your pocket while swimming in the pool. Did I say it looks good? It looks good. The front is the typical edge to edge display, but the back ditches boring solid black or white surfaces for an iridescent, almost holographic look. Find a video of it to fully appreciate. The downside of this, as with any beautiful phone, is that nearly everyone immediately slaps a case on it, obscuring it all behind some bits of cheap plastic. Mi thoughtfully includes a minimalist hard-shell case, which feels nice in the hand (much better than the cheap plastic feel from TPU cases) but it's disappointing that it doesn't match the finish on the phone: It's just a boring matte black. This is somewhat confusing: Why design such a nice shell for the phone only to immediately provide users with something that covers it? The only real annoyance though is the software. Mi shoves a bunch of their own apps into the device when there are much, much better versions built into stock Android or available from Google directly. If you normally use Google apps, you need to pay close attention when first setting up this phone to avoid using the Mi versions instead. As with most vendor bloatware, you're stuck with these, there's no way to uninstall. Then there are all of the little changes, like not having an app drawer, renaming settings slightly and moving them around. The underlying android version is 9, and I came from an older Pixel phone also upgraded to run 9, and the differences were jarring and confusing. If you didn't go looking for it, you'd never know these were running the same underlying version of Android OS. Especially annoying was the default apps settings: Usually on Android you can specify which app you want to use for a task, like default email, browser, etc. Mi sometimes (not always) ignores this. If you don't like their camera app and want to use another from the Play store you can, but all shortcuts like double pressing the power button will ignore your default settings and open the Mi camera app instead. There may be other apps like this too, though the camera is the only one I've found so far. It's relatively minor, but still annoying. Despite the above, this is still a 5-star phone. Even if you look for refurbished phones, it's very difficult to find an alternative to the Mi 9t Pro with the same specs for the same price. ($400 retail, as of this review). Refurbed Pixel 3 XL's go for close to $500 and the newest Samsung or Pixel 4 phones are close to double that, even though they have",5.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro (128GB, 6GB RAM) 6.39"" Display, Snapdragon 855, AI Rear Triple Camera, Dual SIM GSM Factory Unlocked - US & Global 4G LTE International Version (Glacier Blue)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Display-Snapdragon-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B07X5RRZFP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615NIeqoipL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X5RRZFP,49,374.0,0.0

No band 12 which limits my coverage range esp. in outer or older suburbs, else I would have used this as my main phone. If Xiaomi phones have a drawback it is the limited LTE bands available. Get a sturdy case n screen protector for your Xiaomis coz it is what it is. It is less likely to survive everyday drops. The free stock case that comes with it is useless and protects from scratches only. a good feature of Xiaomi MIUI android layer is the Second Space function, which sets up a separate partition with its own login and apps, good if you are giving this phone to your kid to use. you may even grow to like the MIUI system apps and use them over Google apps There's an infra red on this phone so you can use it as a TV remote and a HEADPHONE JACK that delivers decent quality sound.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0

The build quality is exceptional and the phone feels way more premium than many phone that cost double its price. The performance is impressive and the phone is snappy on every level. Finally i was very much impressed with the camera performance especially after installing the Google Camera APK, it really brought the quality of the cameras out. Worth mentioning that the built in camera app is no slouch either especially when it comes to video recording. Video quality on this phone is exceptional and the quality is hard to believe its coming out of a phone. Over all i am very happy with my purchase and i truly have no issues at all with this phone. My only little annoyance came from the fact that it does not have an audio jack and uses a USB-C dongle to connect my headphones to the phone but after few days of usage i stopped being annoyed especially after i bough 3 of those dongles from ebay for the different headphones i have.

And let me tell you I wish I'd do it sooner, this phone can handle any game I've thrown at it like PUBG,FORNITE,VAIN GLORY,DRAGON BALL Z DOKKEN,MOBILE LEGENDS,POKEMON GO AND RUNESCAPE! I'm 6'2 so my hands are farely large and the size and dimentions of this phone are a PERFECT fit. The front facing camera takes crystal clear pictures in both Day to mid-day night time pictures with flash are equally clear without flash they look very pixaly, Selfie Camera is stunning I mean come in 24MP? super sharp and smooth are the pictures I'd I have to say so myself. BATTERY LIFE is excellent not huge but on a full charge whith normal use (web browsing,YouTube,social media,call,text) you can get almost 2 whole days with this phone. And when on heavy-pretty heavy use (gaming,streaming service Netflix etc, music) I would get at least a day and a half of battery. Very well rounded phone.

21049,B07HK4JNV1,liverleef,5,27-Feb-19,True,Yes it works fine in the US with T-Mobile,"The cost of smartphones in the US is absurd. When the family needed new smartphones I decided I wasn't paying 600 dollars or whatever for a phone from my carrier. I started looking online for refurbished phones and instead found the NEW Redmi Note plus 6 here on Amazon and it was cheaper than the refurbished samsung phones I found. I went to the T-Mobile store and the family got new phones with the exception of me. Since we were new to T-mobile they had to give me a new sim card so my banged up Galaxy S5 would work on their network. I found that I could make calls but get no data. Later I learned its probably because the Galaxy S5 doesnt use band 4. I did some research and found that the Redmi Note plus did support band 4 so I was becoming hopeful that I could use the Redmi on T-mobile. When my Redmi Note arrived I found that I needed a nano sim card as it wouldnt take the micro sim in the S5. I got my new nano sim from T-mobile, popped it in my Redmi Note 6 right in the T-mobile store and boom, it came right up, I got 4 bars and LTE! (see my screenshot). I was stoked! I've been using this for a few days now and so far I'm thrilled with this phone. I was a bit concerned about the display as the specs for this device would indicate that the display quality would not be as impressive as the flagship phones from samsung and motorola. Honestly though, I cant really tell the difference having seen these other phones. The display on the Redmi note 6 is bright and colors are vivid. It's also lightening fast and navigating the phone is buttery smooth. Battery life is phenomenal, however it doesn't charge as quickly as other phones but I honestly don't care about this. I work from home and if I go out for any length of time I expect a single charge will last me. The most notable difference I've found between this phone and comparable samsung or motorola phones is the firmware. MIUI is leaps and bounds better than any other Android ROM I've tried. It's super easy to use and extremely customizable. It doesnt have an app drawer though which was hard to get used to at first. I eventually just created a folder and started putting my apps in there. I realize you can use different launchers that use an app drawer but I didnt want to give up MIUI because honestly its that darn great. I won't go into much detail on why MIUI 10 is so impressive but there are plenty of videos on youtube that demonstrate it. This is also my first phone with a fingerprint scanner. My samsung galaxy 5 was supposed to be able to read fingerprints but it never worked very well and it was awkward to use. The fingerprint scanner on this phone however is amazing. I was really blown away at how fast and accurate it is. simply touching the scanner will unlock your phone. I realize that other phones have this feature but for a phone this big, with these specs to have a fingerprint scanner and at this price point is just amazing. Also, if you're on T-Mobile, you can get wi-fi calling to work. You just have to apply a dialer code (search for it on google). I have it enabled on my phone and it works fine. See the screenshot I added. On the downside, this phone doesnt have NFC which is that handy feature that lets you pay with things at the register with your phone. I don't really use that so its not that big of a deal to me but its something to think about if thats your thing. Also, the battery is non-removable. So if you need a new battery, you'll need a pro to have it replaced. EDIT: Well I loved this phone so much but unfortunately T-mobiles network is absolutely horrible and after numerous missed phone calls I was forced to switch back to Verizon. Unfortunately the Redmi note does not work on Verizon so I had to return the Redmi Note and it pained me to do so. Sure wish they made a dual band version of this terrific phone.",6.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0

I had to download a third-party app to make my experience better, which is normally what I do with Android phones anyway, and had to manually disable/uninstall whatever pre-installed apps I didn't find useful. Another concern I had with the phone was the bands it had for LTE connectivity.

Set up was easier than expected, and these phones perform fine on our carrier, Ting. Call quality is good, connectivity has not been an issue 90% of the time, and the user interface overall good save for two very irritating issues. First, the installed MI text message application proved a bit of a disaster. Group texts are received as individual text messages, which created much frustration and consternation. I installed a 3rd-party texting app with better features and made that my default. (I have not checked to see if the system updates have fixed this nuisance.) Second the operating system is set to push ads and offers. Clear the cache, and you might get an ad for a technical college.

24098,B07Q6ZZ4S1,Joel Eagelston,5,26-May-19,True,Great Phone (With Two Small Quibbles),"First, the good: This is an awesome phone for the price. The 48 MP camera is incredible, the fingerprint reader works nicely, and the speakerphone quality is the best I've ever heard. In addition, the MIUI version of Android (don't worry -- Google Play Store is installed and the phone runs all the normal apps) provides a level of visual customization simply unavailable in any other brand of phone. The bad: First, this phone does not receive GSM Band 12, which means you'll likely be limited to carrier speeds of 5 Mbps or so. Having said that, I can listen to music and watch YouTube videos without any problem. Second, the camera sticks out rather far from the back of the phone and the included cheap case doesn't extend out that far, which means you risk scratching that beautiful camera every time you set your phone down on a table. The first time I used this phone, I immediately bought a third-party case that protects the camera (they're available on Amazon for less than $10) and I suggest you do the same. For me, those two small drawbacks were not enough to lower the rating to four stars.

19638,B07FM9913M,A. Heinrichs,4,26-Mar-19,False,*Update* (the adds are gone).... SO. MANY. POP-UP. ADS. Battery not amazing. Otherwise decent phone.,"My original review is below, but I wanted to update it by saying as of June, the ads that were infesting my phone (for more than 3 months) are gone. I can't explain how or why, but they suddenly disappeared. Maybe it wasn't the phone... maybe it was an app or a glitch that an update fixed? I really don't know. I'm updating my review from 2 stars to 4. I can't quite bring myself to give it 5 due to the rough patch I went through with it, the camera can be slow at times on the video or portrait setting, and that I still can't trust it to deliver my text messages in a timely manner, but mostly, I love my phone. The battery seems to be just fine, too. (Probably because it's not popping up ads as a constant hobby) ORIGINAL REVIEW: I want to love my phone. I really do. But I can't get the pop-up ads to go away. While I'm writing a text message. While I'm checking my calendar....etc. I've gotten 3 ads in under a minute at times. It was the perfect phone for the first 30 days, then--it turned. I believe the pop-up ads are what they use to recoup the cost of the this great phone at the great, low price. It has a fantastic camera, but it's no good if an ad pops up while I'm trying to use it. The battery was great (for the first 30 days), but then it suddenly stopped performing as well. The days it couldn't make it all the way through without a charge, I checked my phone usage for the day and it was just under 2 hrs. I could live with the battery issue if I wasn't so frustrated by the ads popping up. I've searched the internet on how to stop them, but the methods I've found don't work. ALSO, many of the text messages I send or receive are delayed, sometimes by hours. Never had this issue with my old phone. Same sim card. Do I recommend this phone? No. Is my camera phone better than yours? Probably. But the beating I take from pop-up ads when using this phone... so. not worth. it.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

23569,B07PY52GVP,Juanparrs,4,26-Aug-19,True,Un celular casi perfecto.,"-El RN7 es un excelente celular a un muy buen precio. La batería que tiene es casi infinita, te da para un día completo fácilmente. Incluso si se cuida bien las aplicaciones que se usan y demás llegás a las 48 horas sin cargarlo y con un 25-20% de batería. O sea, es un teléfono con muy buena autonomía. -Otra a cosa a destacar es la pantalla, la resolución es excelente, se ve muy muy bien. -Es un celular grande, así que tal vez no sea para todo el mundo porque hay gente que le gustan de dimensiones más modestas. A veces es medio incómodo para usar a una mano por su tamaño (y eso que tengo las manos más o menos grandes) pero hay un modo a una mano que se puede activar en opciones, así que no es ningún problema. - El audio es bueno, suena fuerte y nítido, aunque no llega obviamente a un nivel de sonido de un parlante, pero para lo que es cumple perfectamente. - La verdad que los 64 GB de memoria interna son bastante ya de por sí, de todas formas le podés ampliar la memoria mediante una SD, así que es imposible quedarte sin espacio. - El desbloqueo con huella anda impecable, es muy rápido. El desbloqueo facial, lo mismo, es rapidísimo, aunque tal vez no sea lo más seguro. - Por el precio que tiene la cámara es muy buena, aunque es imprescindible descargar la GCAM, la mejora en las fotos es muy notable. Lo negativo: - Es fundamental comprarle un vidrio templado porque ya se me cayó unas 2 o 3 veces y se ven rayones, no a simple vista, tenés que buscarlos bien, no molestan, no se ven salvo que te pongas muy quisquilloso, pero igual. Es lamentable que se te caiga un par de veces y ya hayan rayones por la pantalla del cel. La funda y el vidrio templado son obligatorios. - Otra cosa, cuando vas a escuchar audios por wpp por ejemplo, tenes que poner el teléfono en horizontal por la ubicación de los parlantes, sino se corta el audio por el sensor. Esto es incómodo. De todas formas, estas 2 cosas pasan en casi cualquier teléfono, así que no es tan reprochable. Por lo demás, no tengo quejas.

Also annoying. And the ultimate deal breaker was the screen. Deep gouges from having my keys in the same pocket for a very short period of time. Then I tossed my phone and missed my bed.

23805,B07Q26V49K,Tony LaRicci,5,25-Jul-19,True,Best for the price,"This device offers flagship quality and features at a 'burner' price point. It has an excellent build quality. The back is made of Gorilla Glass 5, surrounded by a good quality plastic frame. The only issue I can see with the build is how slippery the device is - the glass back does not help with this. A grippy case will eliminate this issue. The hardware is great as well, I have not had any issues. The device runs as smooth as any high-end handset I've used. I do not play games on mobile devices, but based on benchmark scores, I'm sure this can play any mobile game you throw at it. The cameras are phenomenal - but held back by the stock camera app. Utilizing a third-party camera app like Open Camera or sideloading the Google Cam app will allow for 4K images and video that are not allowed by default for whatever reason. The battery life is one of my favorite features of this device - it has a huge 4000 mAH battery. This paired with good hardware and software optimization, allows the device to easily last all day. I go about 15 hours of regular use before plugging it in, usually having about 65 - 75% left. It should be said that the device does not come with a fast charge - compatible adapter, so expect average charging rates if you choose to stick with it. Overall, I love this device.

21478,B07JMPGNHK,David Ray Perez III,5,25-Jul-19,True,The best buy for a fair & reliable phone,"I have been using this product for a good 3-4 months to give it a proper review. Well, ultimately I'm impressed with this phone and it's capabilities at such a low price, although for it's price it's not bulky or heavy in anyway and has a nice sleek design to give it that higher phone tier feeling. Runs android 8.0, smooth and fluid interface thanks to the 4GB RAM (games run great when using medium settings), a great 12MP camera along with a 5MP AI (dual camera) to increase some aspects of video/ photos, the fingerprint scanner is great and very responsive, and a 1080p resolution to get the most out of your video. The battery life is decent, but thankfully to the USB-C fast charging it will bring the battery back up to 100% in about an hour and a half. The only issue I had with the phone is that when attempting to use the face recognition, you have to change its region to Singapore? It took awhile but no biggie, I have no idea why, but overall the face recognition is great I've tested it with photos of me that could have potentially unlocked it and there doesn't to seem to be any problem. The Xiaomi Mi 8 lite is a great buy for those on a budget and it is quite the steal for the price. Thank you and have a good day.

21048,B07HK4JNV1,JME,5,25-Feb-19,True,US Purchase - With a Nervous 5 Star Review,"I live in the Seattle area and have Cricket (AT&T) unlimited service, that fact comes into play further on in the review. As a long-time iPhone user, I was ready to mix-it up a little and so was interested in this phone (4gb/64gb) model when I came across a review of it on Youtube. Bluntly, for the $, the phone is amazing. It puts my iPhone 6 to shame. I'm thrilled with the purchase, but point out my approvals / concerns in the following. * Storage: Get the 64gb model. Though there is an SD card, you will soon use the 32gb version on apps etc. The SD card option can be used for camera video, movies, and music, but not for installing apps. That 32gb goes pretty quickly. * Connectivity: Be aware that the wireless bands supported may limit your data speed - or kill it. For example, on my iPhone, with full US LTE channel support and Crickets Unlimited plan, I was getting 3mbps/6mbps (down/up). Using the Redmi Note 6, with only a single LTE channel support, I am getting 3mbps/0.5 (down/up). Which is fine as Netflix etc don't show a difference in quality. For video chat, I would imagine the 0.5mbps ""up"" could be an issue. Note: I've only had the phone a few days and so not tested it while driving to other areas etc. where it may improve/lessen my connectivity. * Camera: Before purchase, I watched videos on YouTube where the 6 Pro camera was recording in slo-mo at 720p and 120fps. Out the box, this is not accurate. The official slo-mo on this camera has no fps options and seems to be locked at 720p at 30fps - so not very good, my iPhone is much better. Perhaps the Youtubers knew of a 3rd party app as the camera seems like it can perform better fps. However, other camera functionality is good. The phone takes great photos overall, 1080p video (max 30fps), and the ""selfie"" mode has the cool feature where the background is blurred. The camera also has an ""AI"" mode, intended to be a one-stop setting where the camera switches scene settings, depending on its environment. Still not fully tested by me. * Battery: My iPhone 6 had great battery life, but the Redmi is even better. I played around installing apps, setting up my options, and testing Netflix etc, and still had 60% after hours of geeking around. * Other points: Seems to be working with my Fitbit Versa - which is very particular about ""supported phones"". Notifications work too on the Versa, but after some setting changes. All in all, a great value for money. Fast device with a ton of storage. I have all my apps installed, and the luxury of many that I don't really ""need"", and still have 40gb remaining. But the fly in the ointment is that cellular LTE support. What will happen when visiting other States or even towns? Will I keep acceptable coverage? To find out, watch this space. 2 WEEK UPDATE: No issues with connectivity after driving 30 mile radius of my home. School, airport, work, visiting trips all kept connectivity. Slower in places, but faster in others. More than enough for my needs of music streaming, maps, email, and calling. All worked great on ATT/Cricket.",10.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0

20888,B07HK4JNV1,Chris R.,5,25-Dec-18,True,Nearly unparalleled value for your money. Simply superb quality.,"The Redmi Note 6 Pro is an excellent mid-range smartphone, the design is modestly elegant and combined with the MiUi 10 experience, I think it works almost flawlessly 95% of the time. Granted, everything has its pros and cons it is almost impossible to go wrong at this price point for what you get. Xiaomi has certainly won me over, even though I came from using the Samsung Galaxy Note series phones. This one just seems reasonable and you get more value for your money, compared to similar phones that want to mark up the price ridiculously. If you are on the fence wondering if this is a good option for you, I'd say it is for what you pay. Xiaomi just needs to focus on expanding into the US Market better and give more support for US cell bands. But other than that, this phone is superb. I will definitely consider purchasing more phones like this one from them in the future. I am increasingly surprised by what Xiaomi can produce.

26944,B07YZLRS3Z,Amazon Customer,1,24-Nov-19,True,International is not Global (Not US compatible),"For someone who is unfamiliar with the terms for foreign produced cell phones, international sounds like it would work internationally. Many of the questions are ""will this work with X network"" and people reply yes, it is an international phone.

22475,B07N6N7JP3,Kirk Nichols,4,24-Nov-19,True,Great phone for the budget minded,"After having multiple Samsung Galaxys and Iphones I've gotten tired of paying $800 or more for a phone. At this stage in the game all the phones are able to do the basics....and Im not looking to play AAA quality games on my phone (though it will). The phone is hefty in the hand, which I actually like. Having a slightly heavier phone actually causes me to grip it better....less chance of dropping it. But that is a personal preference. The screen is crisp and clear....I dont need 4k on my phone, I wouldnt be able to tell the difference anyways. It responds quickly and there do not appear to be any hiccups while moving about on the phone. I was disappointed that it does not have a headphone jack. I don't own a pair of usb c headphones and 90% of what I have in my house uses the jack style. There is an included adapter, but...I still prefer just to have the jack. I can easily get a day and a half from this phone without charging it....and it charges way faster than my galaxy s9+ did. The camera....is far from perfect. It takes still shots fine. The quality is good...not great. There is not a front facing camera...and with android it appears to always have that option, so when I tried to take a selfie with family a black screen appeared. Not a big deal, but different from other phones. The MI UI is quite different from what Im used to with the standard android on the galaxy phones. I would consider it a downgrade...not as intuitive.....and the appearance of ads while installing software which appears to be part of the UI just doesnt sit well with me. I suppose I could root the phone and swap the UI, but its close enough that I wont bother. Either way, this phone is a great value if you dont want to spend a grand on a phone that will do pretty much everything this phone does.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi MI Mix 3 (128GB, 6GB) 6.39"" Display, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Unlocked Multi-Functional Magnetic Slider Smartphone w/Wireless Charging Pad (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Unlocked-Multi-Functional-Magnetic-Smartphone/dp/B07N6N7JP3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QLhYeA2+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N6N7JP3,79,0.0,0.0

23743,B07PY52GVP,Reverendspam,4,24-Jun-19,True,Incredible Hardware for the price,"I have the 64/4 gb version. The camera on this phone is simply amazing. For the price point, this phone is incredible. I have used it so far in the US, Canada, and Mexico with no connection issues. The phone has so many bands built in it should be no issue in most parts of the world. The Pros: The price point, It has Android 9, The camera is phenomenal, memory and the snapdragon 660 chip is sufficient and have had no lag issues for general web surfing and occasional low-intensity graphic game playing, bluetooth and gps works well, this phone is packed with all kinds of sensors, the phone is unlocked and is a true global phone, works with virtually any GSM carrier, the company will allow you to unlock the bootloader so you can customize this phone and add custom roms, there is software available to backup your phone, there is third party software available to remove the annoying ads and hard-coded apps, the MIUI 10 android interface is very user friendly and extremely customizable with all the bells and whistles, their free pocophone launcher is a better alternative than the preinstalled launcher, large phone that has a bright clear screen. The phone charges to 50% in 10-15 minutes. With normal internet browsing the phone lasts almost 2 days for me on a single charge. Cons: the spyware and ad apps that are hardcoded into the phone, this is stuff that connects to Chinese servers and uploads your contacts and photos to their servers. You can turn these off, but it makes it a bit harder to use the phone in a functional way. There is third party software to remove these apps located on the net. The ads are extremely annoying and are placed within some of the system menus. You can turn these off, but on every update, they seem to return. You have to wait days in order to unlock the bootloader. You get a version 3 qualcomm fast charger, even though version 4 is available and works with the phone. Once I hacked this phone (which voids any warranty), the phone is a gem in the rough. I have uploaded the official European MIUI system into the phone that is much better than what comes stock on the phone. I've removed all the bloatware and spyware and it is perfect.

Even after attempted adjustments. I wish I were an agile fingered youth, who can whizz around any tech like lightning. But I'm older, I'm used to iPhones, and I'm generally in a hurry when I do things. If one accidentally touches the screen or even the very edge of the screen of this deice, it immediately DOES SOMETHING. It either dials someone, or changes a setting, but something you don't WANT it to do. Also, the ""On/Off"" button on the side is extremely trigger-happy (sensitive) and is placed in such an awkward spot, that if you don't specifically pay attention every moment during a phone call, it's natural to touch it and cut the call.

19651,B07FM9913M,Thomas Kroplinski,5,24-Jul-19,True,Android as it was meant to be!!!,"This is an initial impression after a week of use. OK, I know that most people usually like an item they have just purchased. I know this review will be more useful and detailed after I've lived with the device for a month or two. However, one feature of this stands out so starkly, that I want to give anyone looking for a phone the an understanding of its benefits. Namely, this phone contains an unadulterated version of Android called ""Android One."" Android One is the Android O.S. as it was always meant to be. That means ABSOLUTELY ZERO ""CRAPWARE"" that only serves to bog down your device and add APPS or ""features"" that you would never have chosen yourself. Today's Android phones often resemble the old Packard Bell PC's that came with all kinds of ""special offers"" designed to provide the manufacturer with additional post-sales income, often by tricking you into purchasing software or subscriptions to things for which much better stand-alone alternatives exist. Android one is just Google Android. PERIOD! There are no offers to download audio books, no special shopping apps, no photo printing apps. NOTHING except the robust features of the Android Operating System. And because of this, you will receive the updates to the OS just as soon as Google releases them. You are not in any way at the mercy of your phone manufacturer who will inevitably need to make sure that the update works with the crapware they include with their ""customized"" (aka bastardized) version of Android. You even have the option of uninstalling parts of Android you don't care for. If you have spent hours trying to ""root"" your ""Android"" device, you can make sure you have a pre-rooted OS by simply buying a phone like this one with Android One!",1.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

I’m just here to vouch for the usability of this product; my boyfriend replaced his S7 with this phone and he LOVES it. He comes home every day all giddy and proud that his battery is only at 40% after an 18-hour work day. I’m happy he’s happy (and most importantly, that he is no longer buying phones to replace the bad with other bad.) I’ve been informed by reviews on Youtube that this phone comes in other designs which may be a little bit sturdier since this IS plastic, after all. I wouldn’t worry about that too much, though; if the phone survived my boyfriend’s hands, it’ll certainly survive in yours. My thoughts? If your phone is sluggish with bad battery life and you’ve got $300 to spare, go ahead and buy this guy. You will not regret it.

It's fast, I've not experienced any lag. It's super smooth as well. Battery does drain a bit fast if you've got either data or wifi on, but I suppose that's every phone. To make up for that, it also charges super quickly. It's also got some pretty cool features. Only slight issue I have is that the charging lead for it isn't like that of other androids. What I loved about having android phones is being able to charge them with virtually any other android charger because charging lead is the same for all. This phone isn't like that, the charging lead is a bit wider. Strange though, my sister also has a Xiaomi brand and it uses the same charging lead as a typical android phone, so it's interesting why this one is different. This isn't a deal-breaker for me though, but it might be something to consider. Overall, great phone, a super great deal for such a cheap price and I definitely recommend it.

For once, glass body phones make sense. I always thought glass front and back pannels were expensive gimmicks that Apple and Samsung pioneered to ensure their built-to-break products would aways need replacing. In this case, glass on back really does feel like a luxury. This phone is supposed to be $150. So much for that miracle. I got the 64gb global version for $230. Four years ago motorolla's g4 could be had for this price. And it was mostly a plastic phone with a gorilla glass 3 screen. The cheap phone industry is so awesome these days! I feel like I got a good deal based on specs even at $230. If you are serious about buying this phone, you have probably done your research, as all the honor, Huawei, redmi, and xiaomi phone basically look the same right now. Coming from the outstanding Galaxy S7, I felt unsure about the whole Chinese brand and MiUI. My fears are dashed. Even though my s7 benched better, this phone is fast.

23557,B07PY52GVP,srinivas kappagantula,5,23-May-19,True,Great value for money and works on T-Mobile Network,"After a week's use Redmi Note 7 redefines what budget android phones can do. Once you can see what this phone can do, its really hard to imagine forking out $1k for a phone that some of the other known name brands make. Xiaomi is a very popular brand that makes really good phones and this one is great value for the money. GSM, two sim cards although you lose one for a micro-sd card, super nice and big display, blazing fast (Snapdragon 660 in a budget phone like thsi!!!) and great storage capacity. Several people have asked whether it works with T-Mobile. Certainly does and I get LTE as well. What's confusing is how T-Mobile labels their Bands and how Xiaomi labels their bands. If you do a side by side comparison of the actual frequencies this phone supports and what T-Mobile supports (see added pictures), only a couple bands are missing but all other frequencies are supported. I called T-Mobile support and they told me it will not work but I compared the frequencies, and bought the phone and it works like a charm. Battery capacity is great, left with about 50% after a full day's use* - your mileage may vary. I am not on the phone constantly. Call quality is great, takes great pictures and video. Note about setup. Follow XDA Developers posts on how to set it up with no ads, although if you choose your region as Europe or US, usuall ads are disabled. I use a different launcher and dont tend to use the system default apps and have permissions set to very light for system apps. Turn of personalized recommendations the very first time you setup, this eliminates a lot of the ads several people have reported observing on this device.",77.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Black - Unlocked Global Version",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-Snapdragon-Black/dp/B07PY52GVP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaskM5hBL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PY52GVP,630,167.0,0.0

20036,B07G8VPHG3,RED DRAGON,5,23-Mar-19,True,Excellent Android One Phone For The Money!,"I watched a review of this phone on YouTube. I couldn't believe for the low price, all the features that came with this phone. For the price of this phone, it's loaded with features that a $500 Android phone would normally come with. The 4000ma battery last me two days. Amazing battery life. It comes with the Android one, Android 9 Pie OS. The minute I turned the phone on I got the latest update. It's a stock Android phone, but that's what I like about it. I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles that the high-end phones come with. And I'm sick of paying the high prices for phones that are outdated in a few years!. So it's nice to purchase a phone under $200, that has the processing speed, RAM and storage this phone has. Had this phone about 3 weeks and I'm very impressed. Feels and operates like a high-end phone. Very quick and responsive. 625 Qualcore Snapdragon processor. The only issue I may have with the phone, and it's a minor one to me, is the speaker. The speaker is very loud if you turned it up and extremely clear, so you can hear everything that's being said. But the quality of the speaker could be better for some people I'm sure. I do listen to a lot of music with the speaker, but when I plug the headphones in, a whole different story. Even has a built-in app to adjust the headphone features to great stereo sound. The Dual Camera's take great pictures! Xiaomi A2 Lite is sold all over China, India, and Asia, so that show's a demand for this phone.

19566,B07FM9913M,Evan Whittaker,5,23-Mar-19,True,Very Exceptional,"I bought this phone for just over $200, and i have to say, i am not disappointed. The screen is great, the touch id works great, face recognition and battery life is kind of ''meh'', but im not complaining. The battery usually lasts the whole with medium usage (a few videos, lots of social media, and a few light games), and the facial recognition works pretty well, albeit not as reliably or as fast as a fingerprint, but its faster than a password, and if you're too lazy to move your finger a little, it works fine, even in surprisingly dark lighting. I upgraded from a dated iPhone SE, and i gotta say im loving it after a week and a half of usage. I gave my old phone away and i havent missed it whatsoever. For $200, i highly recommend this phone if you're on a budget. Now, my only complaint is, sadly, the camera's. Despite the front and rear cameras being 20mp and 12+20mp respectively, I learned that megapixels dont mean amazing cameras. They arent horrible, but they are a bit on the low-end side of things. The portrait mode on the rear cameras works pretty well most of the time, blurring out only the smallest of details in the fore ground (maybe a small branch or something like that). I can live with the lower end cameras on the phone, as i have a dedicated digital camera, but dont pick up this phone for exclusively taking pro-grade pictures, you'll have a bad time. all in all, great phone for the price, it's quick and hasn't lagged once so far, and i love it.

The performance of this is great and it powers through the day like a champ. I can't say enough good things about this device and it's performance. It is just awesome and I recommend this 150%. The camera is great and the quality for the price is obscene, the phone is snappy and fast and makes me feel like I'm using an iPhone, it also has great security features and the first one that was stolen was easily tracked and locked down. It's just a wonderful device and it has created a great experience for me. It has a Headphone Jack and expandable storage and android 9 pie is beautiful with the miui skin on top. The ads are all disabled and I never see any... All who complain about the ads have no idea how to use the device properly. All that needs to be done is turn off recommendations in the mi apps and turn of certain app push notifications. It is a small tradeoff for the quality you get. Thank you for shipping it to me so fast. I'm really happy with this purchase. 6.3 in fhd+ display is great and looks really nice although the blacks could be deeper but overall this is a great device.

It has all the band (no band 71 on TMobile) that you need for TMobile and AT&T. The build and feel of the phone is great. Signal is great in the area that I spent time the most, but should not be a problem anywhere with all the bands that it includes. The phone is fast, pictures are great, full screen and a slider that's very addictive. Miui is simple and fast , just no app drawer. battery life and charging speeds are great for my use. I always make it a full day with charge left over. I started with this phone on metro PC's for 2 months and the service was good with spotty coverage at my worksite.

I'm an iPhone user but I use this as my second device at home and when I'm traveling away from home (not every day commuting). How I use it: - Stream music using Spotify on to my Google Home speakers and Amazon Alexa. - Stream videos from Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video to my TV. - Keep a lot of stuff downloaded for when I fly. - Use the remote app to turn my TV on and off (using the built-in IR blaster) Pros: - Phone is great for the price, can't find anything better. - Expandable slot let me put a $20, 128GB micro SD card which let me make this a fully loaded media device. - Screen is big enough to watch stuff on when I'm traveling (e.g. on a plane) - Fingerprint sensor is great, fast, and easy to set up. - MIUI is nice and easy to use, doesn't get in your way - Android buttons for navigation can be removed and you can use gestures to make the phone feel like an iPhone X/XS! Cons (keep in mind this phone is less than $150!): - Some times a few apps will crash if you're trying to do too many things at the same time - Default launcher isn't great (I use Nova launcher) - Cameras are not the best but they are fine for video chatting, not awesome for photography.",15.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi 7 32Gb+3GB RAM 6.26"" HD+ LTE Factory Unlocked GMS Smartphone (Global Version, No Warranty) (Eclipse Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Warranty/dp/B07QCCW5KB,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FVXlimMTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07QCCW5KB,146,149.0,0.0

I pretty used samsung all my life but I didn't want to pay another $1000 for a new phone. First of all it is a great phone for the amount of money you spend. I looks good in this color, my friend felt the same way. Con The only con about this phone is the camera. It is not even close to what the review videos say or the company claims. Forget 48mp, which is hoax, pull up any youtube video and you'll see that in reality the camera is more like a 12mp if that. But I don't know for what reason it comes out worse than the 2nd phone I have which is a LG G5. The G5 came out in 2016 and it actually has a decent camera on it. So yeah to sum it up. If you want a nice smart phone for under $250 this is it. But if you are buying it because you like taking pictures then you'll disappointed.

BUT LET ME TELL YOU..... when i finally got it in my hand, its a beautiful phone just on looks and feel. its slim, light but sturdy. then once you use it, its a breeze. i wish most phones actually used android the way they did. the camera is excellent, the night mode can be a bit sharper but consider how much you paid for it. and ive read that problem ca be fixed by downloading another camera app. for now, that does not bother because videos and pictures are great as it the speaker is clear but not as loud as the HTC which has beats and two sets of speakers so that spoiled me, i would admit....but still very good the screen resolution is clear and crisp the auto brightness is a bit quirky but again. it works well for how much i paid the phone handles graphics well...I've downloaded king of fighters 12 just to test sound, controls, graphics and battery life. To say that i'm blown away is an understatement. the phone even come with a few software gems pre installed.

23579,B07PY52GVP,H. Hudson,3,22-Jul-19,True,"Excellent value, great phone... with a few caveats.","I've had the Note 7 for a couple weeks, and here are my observations thus far. Please note that this review was originally glowing, but was edited after some trouble. The Good: *The Camera - excellent. Probably the best camera I've used on a smartphone, especially a budget smartphone. *Battery Life - With very heavy use, this phone lasts all day with battery to spare. With minimal use, two days is no problem. *Overall Performance - This phone runs games apps very efficiently, and is very snappy. *Value - For the price paid, this phone is an incredible value. I find it to be one of the best phones I've owned overall. The Bad: *Bad SMS app - The default text messaging app is poor, in my opinion. Particularly if you engage in group texts... If you receive a 'group text', it gets divided out into individual messages, and you can't even see who all received the message unless they reply back. This is a limitation of MIUI from what I understand.... However, there is a workaround. I downloaded a free app called 'Textra' to replace the stock SMS app, and it works flawlessly so far. In fact, I like this app so much that I might start replacing my stock sms apps with it from now on. EDIT: This app, after a couple weeks, either becomes ad-supported or you can purchase it to keep it ad-free. *Cell reception problems - I've added this as an edit, and its a BIG deal. This phone is having some issues with cellular reception, particularly when its left sitting for a while (i.e. at night when I'm sleeping). I discovered this while on call for my work. I missed several important calls, and never knew anyone was trying to reach me. Upon finding out via email that people had been trying to reach me, I checked the phone... It showed a couple bars of service, but when I tried calling out it said 'no network available' or some equivalent of that. After a reboot, I could make (and receive) calls again... but not until the reboot. This happened multiple times during my on-call week, and caused me grief at work. I have to say... even with all the cool flagship level features of this phone (and there are many), I can't use it if the most basic part of a phone doesn't work right. This is affecting my livelihood, and it looks like I'll be trying to return it. It is a shame, because other than that it is a GREAT phone for the money :( Sadly, after finding that the most basic phone functionality is flawed, I'll be attempting to return this device.

Such a shame that it use in USA was killed.,"The have spent eight days trying in vain to connect this phone to either my Consumer Celluar T-Mobil or directly to a new T-Mobil account that I just started.

This week, I have been into Target (where Consumer Cellular in person tech support is) five times and six times to the local T-Mobil store. Knew upfront that this would not work on either Verizon or Sprint, but apparently now, it also does not work on T-Mobil either. I also tried the AAT SIM card from my husband’s phone, with only very limited success. Did get a few minutes of 2G, but that too was fleeting. I have two-step verification on most of my on-line accounts. At this point in time, if a code arrived at all, it arrived 10 minutes late. THE POCOPHONE DOES NOT WORK ON ANY CELLULAR NETWORK IN THE USA. If you want a an updated Android version of an I-Pad Mini to use with Wi-Fi only, this is a very good deal: it just does not make or receive calls.

It's rare that I get 4G/LTE inside a building, even my own home. I live in Indianapolis, and still have spotty signal. For $300+ its a great phone.

After a while, I begin to miss my Galaxy phone... Lesser screen, limited adjustments of features in used before, and obviously the uncertainty of having service when needed.

I even rooted the phone, altered the build.prop file, even had the toggle switch that normally isn't there, was only there because I altered file to make it appear. Long story short, after multiple hours of trouble shooting, doesn't work. Tested it with Airplane mode on, wifi on, no go. It's my fault. I listened to a Q&A answer, I should've contacted the seller. So if there is anything I can say about my experience.... Contact the seller about the phone before you purchase if there is any specific feature you're needing. So, this is an amazing phone for the price point. I got it for my Daughter because she had an old international Galaxy Note 5 that didn't support wifi calling. Someone wrote in the Q&A that this supports Wi-Fi Calling. I have T-Mobile and they absolutely support the feature, it's the phone that doesn't. In fact, there is a hidden menu in this phone and you can see the feature, but it won't let you click.

23581,B07PY52GVP,chris faulkner,5,21-Sep-19,True,What's not to like about this Sub200 Phone?,"Of course this phone isn't a Flagship device, but for the price range.. it is a flagship device. Very snappy, pictures look good, video is nice. I'm on Cricket in middle Tennessee (AT&T GSM) in a very rural part and on my other phone, it was struggling keeping at least a 4g signal and always backed down to 3g. The Redmi Note 7 is staying locked to LTE unless I go in the house and then drops to 4g. Not really a problem but this phone looks like it supports at least 2 of the LTE bands that cricket carries so this is an excellent sign. On my Son's Xiaomi A2, he has to go into the secret menu (*#*#4636#*#*) and change the band to LTE/GSM to get LTE to lock. Phone is way lighter than my Galaxy Note 2 and as soon as I got it, ran the updates and updated all the software. Phone sound quality is great. Phone calls are crisp and sounds great to other people. I've heard people complain about the brightness of the screen but that's not a problem. Coming from the Galaxy Note 2's AMOLED screen to this screen is def. different but you get used to considering you saved yourself a lot of dough. It's no wonder Xiaomi is on the come up, if they keep producing phones like this, they'll become a standard. --EDIT-- I see a few comments saying that they get a lot of ads. I haven't gotten a single ad yet. Still have the stock rom. I've considered unlocking the bootloader and putting LineageOS on it (XDA Devel) but why when the phone is buttery smooth, the OS is just right.

Better then Redmi Note 5 Pro and that was a good phone. I have both. The difference between the 2 are below that made me get the Mi A2 and stood with it. - Better Camera.

(MIUI is not bad but I prefer pure) - AI Camera -Snapdragon 660 The only benefit I found with the Note 5 Pro is the battery. I do like MIUI Rom also. But the Mi A2 is better for me.

Face unlock is quick enough that I only slightly miss the finger print reader. 5000mAh battery helps overcome the convenience of wireless charging. I'll miss the NFC as backup to my credit cards but only a lower tier feature for me. 32GB storage is usable, the expandable SD storage makes tolerable, even though moving apps to SD doesn't appear possible. Biggest drawback I've found at this point that I've had some issues with weak WiFi signal pickup, no issue at home but have struggled to get strong signal at work. Still working through some of the quirks of the Xiaomi interface but expect overtime i'll become more familiar with it, fairly intuitive just different. I haven't spent much time with the camera and evaluating image quality so cannot comment there but with everything else going for it it frankly doesn't matter to me.

20294,B07H41NB46,STEVE!!!,1,21-Jun-19,False,Not for American markets.,"Literally one of the greatest source of stress in my life right now. I don't understand why this phone was ever released to America. It can call and text just fine, but it can't connect well enough to use any smartphone features 80% of the time. I'm sitting at five bars of 4G signal right now, yet am barely able to sustain 20 KB/s of bandwidth. For reference, 4G should be able to sustain well over 400 KB/s. And I'm lucky to see 20. Absolutely unacceptable. I can't tell you how many times I've nearly chucked this glorified paperweight across the room out of frustration. If you live anywhere in North America? DO. NOT. BUY. Even if you only want to make calls and the occasional text, there are MUCH more budget friendly options out there. Not to mention the dodgy quality. I've never actually thrown my phone, but the screen will just randomly decide it's not going to register touch, and has started to randomly close apps on me. There's a reason this phone has the same specs as an $800 phone for half the cost.

This phone repeatedly failed to be recognized by my Windows PC even after enabling USB Debugging, allow apps to be installed via USB and a whole host of other troubleshooting options on what is available on the Internet. I have already requested a refund as Amazon CS tried to connect me with their tech support and they never picked up. This phone needs to go back into the lab and be tested more before being released to the general public. If you're simply looking for a phone for text/call it will serve your purpose. I need to copy video files from my computer via USB cable to the phone for portable viewing; if I can't do that then I will stick with my Lumina 950 until all Windows Mobile support goes out and then will invest in a Surface Pro for portable viewing of my After Effects videos and simply buy a cheap $85 Android phone for text/call service as that is all it is good for if I can't put my videos on there via USB cable.. I've spent 2 solid days trying valiantly to get this device to be recognized by Windows 10 Home and it simply isn't happening. So back it goes for a full refund. I'm all out of patience here. I hope this post gives other users more informed buying decisions and the seller sees it and steps up their tech support service as Amazon CS tried to get ahold of them Friday 2/22/19. Standard Android instructions to transfer files between this device and a Windows PC do not work. I can see the device bit no folders or drives and I have an memory card installed.

19541,B07FM9913M,Brandy,4,21-Dec-18,True,Great phone for the money!,"My husband and I were looking to upgrade from our LG X Charge's from Cricket Wireless. The price had recently dropped to $215 and we jumped on it. Pros: CAMERA. Best camera I've seen on a budget phone. It takes incredible photos with great color accuracy and the selfies really pop. The 20 megapixel low light lens really helps get the extra detail in those low light conditions. IT'S FAST! This phone's 4 GB of RAM is plenty to do your daily tasks and gaming. We never saw any slow down during our use and it's even better since it has received the Android Pie update! ANDROID ONE. Pure stock Android makes this a very easy phone to use and the adaptive battery and display really helps on battery life. Not sure how I would be able to go back to non Android One phones after this. Cons: BATTERY LIFE. Not the worst battery life that I've seen, I'd say it's adequate for average users. I usually average about 6hr30mins of screen on time on an average day of use. SCREEN BRIGHTNESS. The screen itself is fine, but the actual overall brightness isn't the best. If you are going to do some extended outside use you may need to keep the brightness on max and cover the phone with your hand to see it. Overall great phone for the price.

20919,B07HK4JNV1,JayCee,4,21-Apr-19,True,I Call Mine XiaoLin!!!,"And it kicks ass! It's been a month now since I started using my RedMi Note 6 Pro. I'm a mere user so I cant say much about its specs except that this is my first cellphone with over 32gm ROM on board complemented with 4 gb of RAM. It feels dainty and luxurious for me, the color is not glaring but it is pretty (pink rose). The grip is firm and secure. It comes with a complimentary TPU casing with a mounted screen protector. With its about 4000mAmps of battery, it does not weigh as much. I have no intention of testing its resistance to shock, water or extreme temperature (I don't $200 to throw away), but I notice it is reasonably sturdy. As a phone it does not disappoint. The clarity is exceptional and the speaker phone is clear, delivering almost natural voice. The pre-installed apps can be annoying but as soon as I got a handle of them, I would say they work. If did not need them, I can turn them off. In the first weeks of use, I notice that it takes way more ads than my previous unit. But it also comes with an option in Settings to turn these ads off. So far, it's been quiet. The display is great to amazing and the cameras are good to very good. It increased my connectivity for portable hot-spot to less than a minute and the streaming have been way better than with my last phone. I'm new to cellphone gaming and I downloaded through its hot-spot capability some games like Shadow Fight 3, Modern Combat 5, Mobile Legends BangBang, Highway Sniper, Epic War, and Modern Warplanes. They all seem flow through seamlessly, even while running its portable hotspot and opened a couple of URLs at the background. To top all these, and other running apps, I am using the Total Launcher - Star Trek Interphase as theme for this phone, a rather beautiful but top-heavy mobile theme. Its battery life is good. I don't normally use my phone a lot at work, but when I need to log-in to my classes, I use Redmi's portable hotspot fairly through the day. I work on flexi-time as a counselor, and often, I get to work around 830 and be home around 8 or 9pm. I may be wiped out but the phone has at least 25-35% power remaining. I dont charge it straight instead intermittently, keen on keeping at least about 90% power available before I report to work. XiaoMi's RedM Note 6 pro is an excellent product. I'm planning to get my wife and my kids the same if not the more recently updated version of the phone.

Be sure you buy from a reputable dealer and that you are clear on the model you are buying for the US.

This phone has a premium glass feel, responsive, plenty of storage for my use, and 4 GB RAM is enough for all my uses. Unless there's a 4K screen, and you're doing 4K gaming on a phone, there's no need for more than 4 GB RAM. I haven't had any slow down when using the 48 MP camera. It also records videos at 60 fps, which is nicer than 30 fps. If someone's going to complain about the camera, then they shouldn't be taking pics with a phone, that's what a dedicated camera, such as a DSLR is for. The battery life seems typical, last me more than the whole day during my typical daily use. Since it support quick charge 4, I ordered a quick charge 4 wall charger the other day. In my opinion, this is the best bang for the buck.

I thought this is the most worthy phone under $300 until I knew that Xiaomi launched the Pocophone F1 last year which uses Snapdragon 845 with 6GB RAM and only costs you $289! But F1 is ugly, and its camera can't compete with the GM1 camera in Redmi Note 7. So, if you are a phone game lover, just go for Pocophone F1, you will love it.

Honestly I charge the battery every morning during 35 minutes to get it at about 80%. I m using it very often but not playing games and by 11pm I manage to have 25 to 40% of remaining juice from the 80% in the morning... Not bad right? User interface? I don't understand people moaning about it. It just works flawlessly no bugs or slow downs. Full screen gesture is awesome. No more virtual buttons on the screen make it very immersive. A little heavy yes but backed with 4000mah don't forget. Screen brightness perfect. I m coming from Samsung and I can say that the screen is indeed made by Samsung. Not ultra HD but you can't see it anyways starting from 5"" of view distance. Pointless to have more resolution on such a small screen, the more pixel you have the more it drains the battery for something you can't even distinguish... Better save money with this phone to buy a big 4k TV for instance. The pop up cam is very nice but probably not the best again. Be honest with yourself and think about the fact you don't need professional grade selfies 99.99,% of the time so...But I'm not using it a lot anyway so I'm glade it disappears under the screen rather than having those awful notches. Ok last. Under display fingerprint sensor. Except Samsung for note 10 S10 and Apple they all use the same under display camera. It works quite well but not as fast as a regular fingerprint scanner on the back. It misses sometimes but really not bad at all. Here some tricks: you can teach up to 5 different fingerprints so I teached the same finger 3 times to get really fast unlocks. It works quite well.

23747,B07PY52GVP,SCSU Girl,5,2-Aug-19,True,LTE Does Exist,"I just wanted to clarify that LTE does exist. People may be believe it doesn't because they don't see the LTE words. It seems when WiFi is activated the words don't show. Turn off WiFi and you see them just fine. Wireless charging can work if you purchase an adapter. So if it is a must have just get one. Note the standard charging cable for Android phones doesn't work with this phone as it uses a USB Type C cord for quick charging. You will need an adapter or just purchase a new cord if you desire a longer cord. From owning the 5, I suggest not signing up for MUI account. This can have annoying pop up ads on your phone. I found once I closed that account, I had no more issues. If you find you still want to use it, I suggest downloading Blockada to aid with that. Those ads occur simply because that is how Xiaomi is able to keep the phone price low. If you desire a more true to Android experience then take a look at the Mi series. Otherwise, this phone, its features and its camera are perfect! If one more person that uses an Apple phone tells me I need to get one ... I will be giving the side eye for the rest of my life. I have never desired one. I like the fact that if I want to upgrade features or just change phones in 2 years I'm not spending a gazillion dollars for a slight change of features or design. With the way technology evolves, why does that make sense? Compared to the 5 the body is slightly thicker and there is also a slight weight difference. It is not bad just different. Lastly, there was a water submerge test done YouTube on this phone. I suggest watching it. Pretty great results. If you want to save some more money, purchase open box.

25692,B07VD3JH2C,High Tech Granny,5,19-Sep-19,True,Absolute Bargain and the best phone within this price range,"First this phone has the bands for AT&T and T-Mobile and sound quality is crystal clear and speaking of sound quality the external speaker sounds amazing plus it has a headphone jack! Honestly, I can't find anything to complain about, this phone is not only gorgeous, it feels extremely premium with its rounded edges, and beautiful design. Absolutely this has the same level of quality as much more expensive brands, and it's much nicer than my son's mi6 ( which is also great, btw) The case is the one that comes with every Xiaomi phone for free, and it fits very snugly. However, I would suggest buying a better case. It seems that Xiaomi bent over backwards to give us the best phone that they possibly could at this price, and I don't see how they do it! FYI: I am somewhat of an expert with phones and have or have owned practically every brand that you could name, and I am also into the hobby of using custom rom software. But with Android One, there is absolutely Zero need to root the phone. Because there is no bloatware whatsoever on this device. Also the software is pretty much the exact same software you will find will on a Google Pixel...pure AOSP and no bloat. Although I love Xiaomi's other OS ""Miui"" the performance of this device is so flawless, that I would not change a thing. Xiaomi has really hit a homerun with device, and I sincerely hope that they make a strong push for doing business more business in the US. This phone was built by a company whose priority is creating a high-quality device and giving the customers exactly what they want. If you buy this phone, I would strongly suggest using the Mi Community app, to find the answers to any question and to take part in a global community of Xiaomi fans who freely help one another with any technical questions and you will find all kinds of nice, free addons. Software With Android One, you can expect to see updates quickly. In fact there was September update that included the September security certificate, that downloaded immediately after I setup the phone. The update installation took 5 minutes and the phone rebooted without any issues whatsoever. With Android One you can expect regular security updates, and, in my experience, frequent updates are one of the things that Xiaomi does frequently. it's one of the reasons that I have become so very passionate about Xiaomi and the love that they show their customers by providing timely updates, quality products, at such a low price, and I cannot say that about any other android phone manufacturer. Top notch features This phone has an Amoled screen that is visually sharp and color perfect. In fact, it's hard to discern differences between this screen panel vs the screen panel from my higher resolution Xiaomi Mi8. Fingerprint unlock is built into the front panel and it unlocks fast and responds immediately, plus you also have the option of using face unlock. The adapter is a US adapter, and the phone uses USB C which is another nice perk! The phone comes with an remote control IR blaster, which was an unexpected very sweet feature, and the screen is very bright when using the phone outside, at 530 nits.To go on, Gamers can expect their games to work well with this device and although the phone is not Xiaomi's flagship, it does have an Antutu score of a very respectful 145,000. Next, you can expect about 11 hours of SOT (Screen On time)! With the A3's larger battery and efficient display you will definitely get well beyond a day’s use of regular use. The charger that comes with the phone charges at 10 Watts. However, the phone is actually capable of charging at the faster speed of 18 Watts ( AKA: Quick Charge 3.0). Although, it's much better for the phone to use the lower watt charging, because less heat will extend the battery by years. Camera is Fantastic!!!!!! Yes, this camera is outstanding, see the photo above of the sky and trees, pretty nice! The camera has every option you can imagine. I would suggest turning on the AI (Artificial intelligence mode) which will automatically choose the correct setting depending on the subject and available light. The camera on the front and back of the phone are stellar. You can shoot photos in the raw or use the wide array of filters. In conclusion, you should absolutely buy this phone, now before the price goes up! This review is my honest opinion. But I will admit that I do love this highly ethical company. I am absolutely certain that you will not find a better phone than the A3 at this price point. Frankly you are essentially getting a better-looking Pixel 3A at a much lower cost and that is a fact! Finally, I strongly recommended buying from Amazon, I am a longtime customer and anytime that I have ever had an issue they addressed and resolved it immediately.

23804,B07Q26V49K,Robert M.,5,19-Jun-19,True,Best all around phone!,"Do you want a beautiful looking slim phone that won't break the bank, has great battery life, an amazing camera, can play pretty much any game you throw at it?? Look no further! Xioami redmi note line of phones offers what no other does, a balanced phone all around. Most companies when they produce phones you either get one or the other a great performing phone with a terrible battery, looks like a brick, or has a great battery but lacks performance and a terrible camera. Before this phone I had the xiaomi redmi note 3 which is quite outdated now but performed great for YEARS at a $200 price point offering just what this phone does but more up to date being 2019 xiaomi still meets my expectations this phone has just what you need a great long lasting battery that will go all day with heavy use, a good camera, and can run pretty much anything you throw at it no need to pay Samsung $1000 for the same thing. There is only one downside to buying these unlocked phones I have come across which is the lack of wifi calling using your normal cellphone number, this feature is only offered by phones you buy directly from carriers. I do have a work around though for people living in rural areas that absolutely need wifi calling, Google Fi. Google Fi let's you port your number to their service which gives you the capability of wifi calling, wifi texting, and also gives you the capability to make calls,text, view voicemail all from the hangout app on your phone or computer.

23858,B07Q26V49K,J. Alvarado,3,19-Jul-19,True,Can Range from 5 Stars to 2 Stars depending on what features you value,"So I've had this phone for about a month now. I think out the box, I would have jumped at the chance to review this phone a solid 5. There are days recently that, even at a great value, I want to chuck my phone halfway across the room. So I feel the phone is more solid than not hence my rating. Let's start with the positives: Value: This is what a solid 400-500 dollar phone should feel like. Fortunately you get it at 200. Most mainstream budget phones will not give you the amount of RAM that this phone provides. It's got a solid feel. Phone has been dropped 3 times already with no cracks to the screen. I'd invest in one of those gel foam type covers. It does one main thing. When your phone hits the pavement face down, it gives the edge enough of a buffer zone to minimize or prevent damage to your screen. Call Quality: This was the biggest drawback to my last phone Moto G and the single reason why i refused to buy a new one for this year. Call quality is solid. Pick up the phone in a noisy place and people can still here me without the use of a microphone type ear piece. Camera: The quality of the camera in my last budget phone (Moto G purchased 2 years ago) was absolute garbage especially in low light (to be expected from a budget phone). I don't know how this company did it, but they managed to pack a quality camera into this price range (maybe Privacy is the exchange for it all). I've been watching shows with the lights off and I've managed to capture quality snapshots of the shows i'm watching even zoomed in. Alright now to the drawbacks (and they may be dealbreakers for some of you) User Interface: Absolute Yuck. I've gone from an Amazon Firephone 4 years ago to a Moto G 2 years ago to this phone AND the last two phones took me about a week to get used to the Interface that is used. Such is not the case with this phone. Notoriously difficult to naturally navigate through programs. There are usually a step or two extra that you have to take to toggle between programs. There is a crap ton ofbloatware. The cleanup feature i do enjoy but I could do without everything else Default Web Browser: After about a month, I have ZERO clue how to make Firefox Mobile my default web browser. Everytime someone sends me a Twitter link or a link of any sort through text message and email, the phone will use its own web browser to open up the Link. Wouldn't be such a big deal except for the fact that I'm usually signed in to Twitter and Youtube through Firefox. I tried following directions online to no avail. No option to make Firefox my default web browser AND no option to uninstall this garbage of a web browser. Sound: Probably the single worst phone I've owned when it comes to sound quality. It's not even how well or unwell i hear someone on the other line or a video on Twitter. It's in the fact that the sound range is wildly inconsistent. One time I have to adjust the volume all the way to high to be barely able to hear someone....few minutes later that person's voice is piercing in my ear and now i have to adjust the sound volume down. Same with videos. Really you can forget about watching anything without a good set of headphones. Even then though, you constantly have to be adjusting the volume level up and down. Reception: Don't know what the band rating is but this phone's reception has been less impressive than with my last two phones. I am on the AT&T network. When this phone goes down to one bar, forget about it! You just lost a call. I've never looked down on my phone, seen one bar, and then go back to full bars without dropping the call. And yes this phone seems to go down to 1 bar plenty. There is a stretch of highway that i take every week. Just for the heck of it, I took my Motorola Phone and used it this past week. It held steady in that stretch of highway while on the phone. This phone will always drop my calls and lose reception there. Battery Life: Don't know if this is so much on the phone than it is on my programs so I add this to the negatives with a BIG CAVEAT. Brought most of my previously installed programs over from my other phone. This phone was holding charge for 2 days straight with consistent usage. Once these programs started updating, my battery life slowly strted to deteriorate. Now It's still a full day of solid usage before I charge BUT it's now half of what it used to be. Again BIG CAVEAT may be the programs i'm employing may be eating away at Battery Life because same problem existed in my Moto G a s new updates kept coming out. So there you have it. It's a 200 dollar phone. If Value and Call quality matter to you then this is the right choice. Bloatware and such an issue, stay away from this and defn get yourself a Motorola or wait until u can get a refurbished Pixel 3G for around the same price.",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Blue - Unlocked Global Version, No Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-64GB-Snapdragon/dp/B07Q26V49K,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FBnbqW3pL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Q26V49K,471,166.0,299.99

20177,B07GPNGWNK,High Tech Granny,5,19-Feb-19,True,Flagship Phone with All of my US LTE Bands,"We were so impressed by this phone that we bought two more. Honestly this phone seems like a what you would get if Apple and Samsung had a baby! It not only has outstanding cellular reception, it is beautiful and extremely high quality. Setup was so easy, all I had to do was touch my old phone and the new one together and everything automatically transferred to the new phone via NFC. If your old phone doesn't have NFC you can use the Google app called ""Files""and it will transfer everything from the old phone to the new one! Such an Easy process! After applying the easy update the phone operating system is now at the latest version of Android 9.0. I can not believe how good good the battery life is on this phone. Easily two work days of use on one charge. The phone arrived faster than what was promised and its everything I thought it would be.

The picture quality and battery life are great! The phone came with a European type charger as these phones aren't designed to be sold in the US yet. Two days ago I made a call to my wife while we were both at the supermarket. I called her to find her in the store. I could hear he voice fine. Yesterday, I received two calls back-to-back and thought the sound in the earpiece was gone completely or that I may have accidentally set the phone to mute. Turns out there was sound but it was so faint that I couldn't possibly make a call. I tried the speaker function and it worked well. I haven't yet tried hooking up a headset/earbuds to try that function. Here is the kicker, I tried contacting support and the title in the chat window states US support yet they said they do not have technical support for the US. They gave me an email that I sent a message to and I'm now waiting for a response.

26566,B07X5RRZFP,SerbianWolf,4,18-Nov-19,False,Flagship killer!,"I bought this phone in Naples, Italy in a small store. I previously researched many options and finally settled between this phone and slightly more expensive OnePlus 7T. Unfortunately, OnePLus was nowhere to be found and I needed phone urgently (my old LG G5 died) so I went ahead with Xiaomi. Now, here's a long story short: this is an AMAZING phone! It is worth every cent and performance is stunning! Everything runs smoothly, screen is beautiful, design is something you will want to show off in a transparent case for sure! I do have to admit I'm very happy with my purchase and phone is definitely named a ""flagship killer"" with a good reason. For money you pay for it you won't find a better phone. Now, here's the parts where it doesn't deliver, and yeah, it can be a deal breaker for some (and reason I gave it 4 stars). * No SD card slot. - This is my biggest issue, as in today's world 64/128 Gb might not be enough. * No wireless charging - I can live with that, but previous versions of this phone had it, so why they couldn't add it to this one? It would be a cool thing to have. * Spying - you will have to spend an hour or so and dig through ALL of the options and switch off all the insane, intrusive settings that happily grab your personal data. Even Google would be ashamed how deep some of these settings go. Switch it off as soon as you start the phone and check after every system update if they're turned on. Not nice, Xiaomi, not nice at all. * Update to Android 10. - This should be a positive thing, but since the update, some of the options stopped working, like USB tethering or a WiFI hotspot. You can turn them on by turning on the Developer Mode (check online how to do it) but it is shame it doesn't work now and it was working with original Android 9 MIUI. It might be fixed in following updates but for now, you have to use this workaround. Final verdict: an awesome phone, well worth the money you pay for it. If you can pay a bit more, try to get OnePlus 7T but if you want to save some cash, this one will serve its purpose quite well. P.S. I know it is quite improbable, but when you put it in your pocket, do it so that phone is turned up, as it should be - camera tends to pop out and if it is upside down, it can get damaged.",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro (128GB, 6GB RAM) 6.39"" Display, Snapdragon 855, AI Rear Triple Camera, Dual SIM GSM Factory Unlocked - US & Global 4G LTE International Version (Glacier Blue)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Display-Snapdragon-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B07X5RRZFP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615NIeqoipL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X5RRZFP,49,374.0,0.0

Not many cases are made for it, and the ones that exist have a problem with using the MIUI gestures. I used this to replace a S8+ and am super pleased with the choice so far. The only drawback so far is that the screen has a low resolution compared to the S8+ which is pretty odd, but 1080p+ (horizontal is more than standard 1080p) is the standard screen on all Xiaomi phones. Update: Still super satisfied with the purchase, bought to use with Mint Mobile, so all in this phone and a year of service cost me about $500 or half a flagship Samsung phone without service. Dislike the Mi apps for the most part, but replacing them with other Google apps isn't hard, also would rather have SD card space rather than a second SIM, but for this price, willing to overlook it.

I pretty much exclusively use this phone at home for playing mobile games, but the wi-fi dropping every 2 minutes makes it a ridiculous hassle. Also, the only plug the phone came with was a European power adapter so I had to plug it into my PS Vita brick to actually charge the phone.

22486,B07N6N7JP3,Phone master,5,18-Apr-19,False,Awesome phone,"Let me just say wow never left Samsung after I had HTC, LG, AND SONY. The carrier I have is AT&T and I've used this phone for 2days of normal use. BATTERY- it's more than ok for such a small battery on a big screen right now it's 515 pm and I have 73p of light use. My note 8 would be dead by 2. I had a note 8 and it couldn't last three hours of screen on time at alone not using it at all. Humm ya 1000 I paid haha. PRICE- I paid 590 with tax and it comes with some extra in the box as people have posted,nice touch. Although there is no app drawer I found it easy just to put all the apps u don't use for the phone in one folder. Last thing I wanna say love the features for the price as well, best finger print scanner and two faces is the best thing on this phone . U can use this to switch from the phone u use to a completely blank phone that u can use as a second phone. As far as I know no phone company in us has that. Ok back again 2 day later I dropped my phone cracked camera lens still works as is but yet no replacement. They have replacements for all there other phones BUT this one. I would recommend putting a camera cover on it not lens, COVER. Jut type in camera cover for ur phone in Google and u can get them on Ebay as well.

The wifi connection to my 2.4/5G router also works flawlessly. Also, the AI powered camera works pretty nicely although not close to those expensive phones from Huawei, Apple or Samsung, but they also have much higher price tags. The only problem I have with this phone is my AT&T 4g/LTE. I live in USA and band 2 is the main LTE band available in my area. Unfortunately, it's not supported by this phone.

20897,B07HK4JNV1,Astro,1,18-Apr-19,True,"Poor build quality, bad camera, ads everywhere in the UI, impossible to root.","Overall the build quality of the phone is cheap, not much of a surprise but some things to look out for; the glass scratches too easily, mine has marks from being dropped on a skateboard. The chassis is plastic and will flex in your hand. Even the vibration motor FEELS CHEAP. There are far better phones for the same amount of money. The camera quality is piss poor, having 4 cameras doesn't make for better pictures, especially when 2 of them are dormant and useless outside the camera app. selfies are blurry, and colors are off balance. unless the phone is completely still on a clear, sunny day, the picture quality is just garbage. They turn out blurry and unclear. and color reproduction is far off key. I can't express just how bad the camera is on this phone, among the worst I've used. Here comes the icing on the cake, after becoming extremely frustrated with the amount of ads in the UI I tried to unlock it to install my own ROM which would allow me to have control over the phone. Everytime you install an app, ADVERTISEMENT. everytime you open a system app, ADVERTISEMENT . They're EVERYWHERE in the UI and it's absolutely ABSURD and frankly OFFENSIVE. Rooting the phone would solve the problem of the Advertisements everywhere, however Xiaomi requires you to create an account on their forums, with your EMAIL and PHONE NUMBER, where you can ASK to unlock it. Absolutely unacceptable considering Android is open source software. If that isn't enough, you're required to be on a mobile network, not wifi, during the unlocking process. There's no reason for this as on all other non-Xiaomi devices can be unlocked without even being connected to the internet. THIS IS MY WORST GRIPE WITH THE PHONE AND IT CANNOT BE FIXED UNLESS XIAOMI DECIDES TO CHANGE THE UNLOCKING PROCESS OF THEIR PHONES. I can't express how frustrating this has become. I would never recommend this or any other Xiaomi device to anyone except my enemies.",9.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0
23587,B07PY52GVP,Maddie,5,17-Sep-19,True,The internet made it seem like it would be extremely complicated to get this working in the US!,"I was torn for days about buying this because people on reddit and other forums talked about how difficult it was to get it working in the US, but it ended up being surprisingly easy to setup. I ordered a Straight Talk AT&T Sim Card and a service plan, received the sim in a few days via free Fed Ex shipping, and then inserted it into the Redmi Note in sim slot #2. I read online if you set up a data or phone service in sim slot #1, you can no longer use any other card on #2. I followed the instructions Straight Talk sent along with the sim and my phone service and LTE data was working right after a restart. It was very easy, it definitely works with Straight Talk in Denver, CO USA. No problems with data or LTE bands, or making/receiving phone calls as of 9/17/2019. As for the phone itself - it's probably the best phone I've ever owned personally. I've only had fairly cheap phones so I can't tell you how it compares to the current flagship iPhone or Samsung. It's very fast, responsive and intuitive to setup. I immediately installed Nova Launcher, Adguard for ads/trackers, and none of these slowed the phone down in the slightest. The battery lasted all day and evening, through an 8 hour work shift where I had bluetooth, Wifi, and was playing HD video. I think when I went to finally plug it in before being up with it for around 18 hours, it was still at 40%. I can't comment on whether or not fast charge works as I don't believe the charger they sent is capable of doing that. It charges quickly enough though. There were a few bugs with scrolling/picking up my fingers sometimes that alarmed me but went away after a restart. I assume it's just Miui updating or other apps updating. The screen is beautiful and clear. The phone comes with a back cover which is fine, I guess - I probably will get something different. I plan on setting up a mod from XDA forums, and that will be a process in itself because I've read unlocking the bootloader on this phone is a days/weeks long process. I will update this later when I get into using the camera or other features. Still testing everything out! I feel at this point, you cannot go wrong with buying this phone. At it's price point you get a phone that looks and feels expensive, has a big screen, the same processor as things 3x it's price, plenty of ram, and a great camera (this requires tweaking), and can pretty much run most things you throw at it. If you don't like MIUI, you can change that later on. Don't be intimidated about setup for a prepaid service! Lots of information out there says you can't do it, but it completely works.

20365,B07H7SBBWQ,Alex D.,5,17-Nov-18,True,The best phone I've ever owned,"I have bad luck with smartphones. Either the phone I purchase doesn't fit my needs for one reason or another, or it somehow breaks within months of purchasing it. So far, the Redmi 6 has yet to live up to this on either front. It supports all the LTE bands I need, and it is a surprisingly durable phone for its price. I have managed to get water in this phone twice since I've owned it. Both times the phone would get stuck in a boot loop, but after awhile it would shrug it off and continue to work like nothing ever happened. I've verified full functionality with benchmarks and diagnostics, too, so this isn't just perception. You can also look up the video of this phone cracking walnuts with its screen if you need any more reassurance that this is not a phone that reflects its price tag. Additionally, if you are worried about GPU performance being lackluster, don't be. While the GPU benchmarks on this phone don't exactly impress, in practice it is more than enough to handle most things you can throw at it. PUBG Mobile on low settings runs mostly fine, with only occasional hiccups. The CPU is ahead of the curve in this price range, so keep that in mind, as well. Emulated Sega Saturn games in Yaba Sanshiro actually run better than they do on my Moto G6. MIUI is a mixed bag, admittedly. Thankfully, you can run your own launcher on top of it with negligible impact on performance. I use Nova Launcher to retain a stock-ish Android feel for the home screen and app drawer, but use MIUI for its highly customizable theme engine. The result is a phone that looks quite unlike any other, a huge plus if you're like me and like things to look sleek and orderly. You will have to spend some time to find a good enough theme, but once you do, you won't ever want to go back. Aa far as form factor and features go, again, this phone is better than you'd be led to believe. People have complained about the rear mounted speaker and that the rear of the phone is made of plastic, but neither of these have proven to be troublesome just yet. It helps if you get a case, too. The screen is decent, nothing special but it won't be an eyesore for the vast majority of people. MIUI also allows you to set color temperature, which is a nice feature I wish was built in to more phones. The only complaint I have in regards to the screen is that the aspect ratio does make the phone feel a little long and makes pressing buttons towards the top of the phone a bit of a chore. The camera is acceptable, nothing special but it gets the job done. I do recommend keeping the glass in front of the lenses clean, as there has been noticeable streaking in some pictures I've taken with it. Otherwise, it's not bad, but don't expect to win any photography awards with it, especially in low light. Overall, I can't find much wrong with this phone, especially for the price. One thing I will say is that you need to be careful when purchasing accessories for this phone, as I've already had one instance of ordering something that was listed as being for this phone that was actually made for another. Past that, I can't recommend this phone enough.

19537,B07FM9913M,wliston86,5,17-Dec-18,True,Amazing Phone - Fast Processor - Great Build Quality - FULL REVIEW,"FULL REVIEW ON PHONE - So look this phone is great. It cost me $215 and works great with T-Mobile. I live out in the country so I always look at cell providers service map and T- Mobiles map is highly detailed regarding the kind of service you will get. This phone actually gets better reception then what there map says I should. Xiaomi is eyeing up the US market in 2019 so they are gearing a lot of there phones to be fully compatible with US cell carriers and this phone is no exception. The LTE bands work great. I have Mint Mobile who is a MVNO through T-Mobile and I get up to 100mbps with them when I have full service with this phone. The phone has a GREAT Snapdragon 660 AI Processor. This is the cheapest phone you will find that comes with an authentic Snapdragon 660. Because it has such a great processor it is very quick and runs games like Players Unknown Battleground and Asphalt 9 on the highest settings without any frame rate loss. However, if you are a Fortnite player due to restrictions on the GPU card that is paired with the SnapDragon 660, it won't be able to run it at this time. That's on Fortnite's end not the phones end. If it can run PUBG fine on the highest settings it surely could run Fortnite. The finger print scanner is super fast. The phone is fully upgradable to Android Pie 9.0. A lot of phones come with bloatware however this phone does not. It comes with Android One which is the organic version of Android Pie not some companies overlays and skins. Basically Android One is the way Android was designed to run from Google. Because there is no bloatware it adds to the speed. This phone WILL 100% WORK WITH TMOBILE & ATT. It will also work with all there MVNO's like Cricket, Metro PCS, Mint Mobile. This phone WILL NOT WORK with CDMA carriers like Verizon or Sprint If you want cheap cell service I HIGHLY recommend Mint Mobile. It's like $24 a month if you pay for a few months up front and works great with this phone. The only downside I see is there is no expandible memory in this phone however it comes in 64gb and 128gb models so that should be plenty. If you take lots of pictures you can always keep them on the Google cloud. The phone comes with unlimited picture storage on Google cloud, if you save the picture as ""standard"" quality. Some people complain about the battery size however they are not realizing that this phone comes with such a power efficient processor. So it works great. If you play graphic intensive games like me it will last 5-6 hours if your browsing the web 8-10 hours if your just texting and calling with mild web use it will last all day. Don't worry about the wording INTERNATIONAL OR GLOBAL VERSION. This phone rocks. If your on the edge then just buy it you won't be sorry. 30 DAY UPDATE: I've been really enjoying this phone. I've had zero issues regarding performance or battery power. This phone will run pretty much every single app on the app store unless the app developer chooses not to support this phone specific processor. I Dropped it once with just the stock silicone case that came with the phone and it held up great. Not even a dent. It is really well built. As stated above the fingerprint scanner is superb. I got the Xiaomi Mi A2 & she got the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite. Both phones are amazing. If you want a bigger battery w/ expandible memory go with the Most A2 Lite it comes with Snapdragon 625. As long as Xiaomi doesn't pull a One Plus move and raise prices I will be a Xiaomi customer for life. My cell service Mint Mobile (via Tmobile) has been fantastic. I did some more research and the next cheapest phone with this processor is $425. So this phone is a STEAL at $215. UPDATE 90 Days: So I've had this phone for 3 months now and it is still in mint condition. I dropped it twice from high up in the stock silicone case that comes with it. I'm 6'4"" and not even a scratch. It still runs the newest apps like a champ. The battery lasts significantly longer the I originally anticipated. I'm moderate user and do use it as my primary internet device. I charge it maybe ever night to every day and a half. So there is no issues with the battery. Also the unlimted ""Standard"" pictures that you are allowed to save to Google cloud for free is awesome. I'm a Xiaomi believer now. This is by far one of the best brands you can get for the price. They have a USA customer for life!! 90 Days in & I STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND",130.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

Maybe my cat knocked it somehow, but it was out of my reach. Also several aps have compatibility issues, mostly with the lock screen. Audible and several music players I tried to replace the default with wont show on the lock screen. You cant change how long the screen is on until it goes off, making it incredibly annoying if you have to do something for 7 or 8 seconds and have to type in your password again.

Here are some thing I was worried about before purchasing: 1. Screen resolution. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the 720p display, but I honestly can't see any individual pixels. I'm coming from a MotoG4 Plus with ove 400ppi, but I can't tell a difference in the screens because of the lower resolution. So, if you are worried about the smaller screen resolution you can remove that item from your list of to-worry-about items. 2. Finger print reader. Yes, It seems a bit slow. And by that I mean it take about 1 second to read the fingerprint and display the unlock screen. In the first days it also felt like it was not recognizing my fingerprint about 1/2 the times. However, after a few more days, that percentage has gone up to more than 90%. I think this is just me getting used to place the finger in the right spot on the screen. 3. Amoled screen It's nice that you can get an AMOLED screen for this price, however I am disappointed that it lacks the most important functionality (from my point of view). That is: display at least the clock, and possibly notifications when the screen is off, ESPECIALLY when you move the phone. (take it out of pocket or just move it if it sits on the table). I got used to that feature in my old phone and it's a shame this one doesn't do that. It does display the fingerprint sign when the screen is off and you move the phone, so putting at least the clock on the screen as well would have been super nice.

The back is plastic, you can hold it without fear of it slipping out of your hand like the 'fancy' BS glass backed phones. MiUi Gestures make the phone crazy easy to navigate. I've never used fingerprint sensors, or face recognition before, because it's always to slow, this phone is seamless and I have both options activated. The S10 was akin to waiting for my kids to do the dishes when using either, and a lot of butt texts of inappropriate pictures were sent to my wife on accident because the dang thing would unlock in my pocket.

The only issue is that as I've already said, very few times it crashes in different aspects (can be screen, audio or system). Another detail is that when it's on full screen, sometimes it's difficult to touch the corners' buttons (like for example if you're watching something on YouTube, the options are hard to press).",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Blue - Unlocked Global Version, No Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-64GB-Snapdragon/dp/B07Q26V49K,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FBnbqW3pL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Q26V49K,471,166.0,299.99

22468,B07N6N7JP3,JB,5,16-Mar-19,True,All Around Excellent Phone,"This is easily the best Android phone I've ever owned and I'm on number 11. The nearly bezel free screen is something to behold. No matter what you think of the idea of the slider in general, having no notch is just awesome. It's difficult to not understate how great the screen looks without a notch or punch out obstructing without seeing it with your own eyes. I love that the slider can be customized to open whatever you like. Mine opens Hangouts because I use that more than I take selfies. It also answers and disconnects calls no matter how you've customized it. Hanging up via the slider is strangely satisfying. MIUI is significantly better than I expected and very smooth but that's probably owed to the 845's speed chip more than anything else. That said, I had an oddly strong reaction to MIUI's square buttons and quickly installed Rootless Pixel Launcher and love the look now. Quick Ball sounds neat, and actually is once open, but was a bust for me because I feel it is too difficult to envoke quickly. I fully planned to root and go to stock Android but I don't feel a strong need now that I've installed all the equivalent pure Google apps. MIUI is somewhat aggressive in suggesting their own equivalent which will surprise no one. If you also want to go down the Google path for things like contacts, photos, etc., you should install all the Google apps before doing anything with the phone. When it detects two of the same on the device, it will present a pop-up asking which app to use and includes a radio button to always use that app. Contacts was the only tricky selection choice as they use almost exactly the same icon and are both aptly named simply Contacts. Hint: Google Contacts is a slightly lighter shade of blue. I botched that on the first try with the always option selected. Correcting that took some searching. If you're in that boat, go to Settings > (counterintuitively Installed Apps, not System Apps) Defaults > Clear Defaults. After that just do some action where the choice would be called up anew and carefully select the Google analog. The facing left side button is mapped to Google Assistant out of the box. What's in the box impressed me as a US consumer: 10A wireless charging pad, USB-A to USB-C cable, European style outlet adaptor, plastic snap on case, sim ejector. I activated the handset on Google Fi with a sim card I pulled directly from a Fi Nexus device without issue. I live in suberbia on the south shore of Boston and haven't noticed that I no longer have access to Sprint's network as I did with a full Fi device. TMobile LTE has been strong and reliable. Obviously, your milage will vary by location. As a puppy owner, I would have liked to have the option to use a SD as storage as I've managed to snap over 3,000 pics in six months time. Amazon's free full resolution photo backup has helped with that concern. FYI - You cannot use the extra sim slot for a SD card. If I enjoyed international travel sim #2 would be a nice feature. But I don't enjoy it so someone else will have to review that. Hint: Install your sim in the slot that will be nearest the bezel once the tray is inserted into the phone. The phone will activate regardless of the slot selected, but Google Messages (sms app) really, really wants it in slot #1. I haven't found information on the tray anywhere convenient. Sim #2 is the tray option that will ultimately sitting deepest into the device. Rear camera setup takes great photos with AI and HDR turned on. Neither are on by default until you set them. The speed in opening the camera app could be better. It's not slow (vs. Nexus 6p), but nobody will ever say it's blazing fast either. Hopefully future software updates will address this. Selfie camera also takes nice pics. The field of view took some getting used to as it's superior to phones I've used in the past. It's well worth investing five minutes to play around with the settings to get what suits your needs. I also want to mention I had a fantastic experience with the seller, Mega Mobile. I was able to get ahold of the owner within 60 seconds to request special shipping considerations. He took the call in his car on the way to the store! They included a free US outlet converter which was a nice surprise considering I was not expecting that and it must come out of their own pocket.

23790,B07Q26V49K,Max H.,4,16-Jun-19,True,Connection is a major if,"A couple of things about this phone that need to be kept in mind. This phone's hardware and software features are phenomenal. The camera works amazing with gcam, the speed at which the phone runs is amazing, you have about 50 gigs of storage after software, and battery will last you around 1 and a half days with regular use. Only issues I have is that the speaker isn't dual it's single, the bands of lte at which it can connect on in the US are minimal, and it doesn't have nfc. On the side note I'm connected with cricket wireless, and have had no issue with connection on mobile data. Tips with this phone for mobile data is to put the Sim card in the sd card slot until you change the IMEI number to the second port. That can be done on the phone. Second tip is that this phone takes around a day to lock a good connection with band 5 for 4g lte usage so if it doesn't work at first it's because it's establishing signal. You can also change preference to 3g which works just fine and is about as fast. I live in South Texas really close to the border of mexico, and cricket gives me a plan that allows free roaming in Mexico so I have that turned on so if your carrier plan allows free roaming I would turn it on just in case. Overall, ive had really good connection considering the limits. If you live in an area where band 5 isn't stable I would advise not buying this cellphone and getting something like a Nokia 5.1 which is just as good at a similar price point.

21041,B07HK4JNV1,Toan Le,1,16-Jan-19,False,It has many deficiency,"When it come to comparing the RedMi, I use my old 2015 Moto X Pure as the standard. Jumping from that I found many things that do not get noted. 1. Screen Size - 19:9 6.2 in screen vs 16:9 5.7 in screen - one of the biggest disappointment and reason I bought the RedMi is that it said it had a larger screen size, but in regards to ppi the Moto X Pure has 117 more ppi which is 403 ppi vs 520 ppi. This means that the Moto X Pure an older phone had a higher resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels vs the 1080 x 2280 pixels. Because of the longer height, it is deceptive in saying it is a half inch longer in screen size, but you are losing out 3 mm in width. Also the notch is included which makes it deceptive. 2. App Issues - Not compatible with Google Fit and YouTube. The pedometer does not work with google fit and it doesn't record steps, you can you other apps like Nike Fit, but this is a no-no if you are planning to use adventure sync. YouTube mostly supports 16 X 9, meaning that videos you view will get black bars. It does have pinch zoom which fixes this issue a bit for some videos, but this means you might have difficulties with subtitles. 3. Spotty LTE Connection with T-Mobile. Going in I knew that the bands were limited, but there were times the connection would disconnect when driving and I could not get coverage. The fact that the Moto X Pure has both GSM and CDMA and I never had an issue with it's connection make it way better in coverage. 4. It run on the MIUI. Going from stock android to MIUI, you will have issues. These can be nitpick but a fair warning of user planning to buy, as it uses MIUI instead of stock android. This is big if you used to an OS with no bloatware. 5. Camera, yes it dual camera, but it is a 12 mp camera compared to the 21 mp camera for Moto X. My conclusion is that there are better budget flagships. If screen size is important to you I would consider another phone. If you want a phone that serves as a good mini computer, this works well with it's 4000 amp battery and large ram size.In regards to the camera, it does have intelligent AI and dual camera, but it skims and scrapes on certain places that make it show less value for the money.",15.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0

26754,B07Y8YWTFL,Antonio Borges,5,16-Dec-19,True,Does almost everything a brand name smartphone can do at a fraction of the price!,"As an iPhone owner for 10+ years, I grew tired and frustrated of spending absurd amounts of money everytime a new model came out or the one I was using became obsolete. Not to mention the frustration of how expensive repairs are as well. Due to this I decided to cross the pond and switch to Android under the insistence of my friends saying that Android is ""better"" and ""cheaper"" than Apple. So I decided to research phones, but immediately found out that top notch Android phones are as expensive as it's fruity competitor. Overwhelmed, I called a friend to talk about my dilemma and he said ""you need to get a Redmi Note Pro"". I was like ""Redmi, who?"" Well let me tell you, the Redmi Note Pro 8 sports the following specs: Dual SIM Card Slot, 64 GB (expandable), 6 GB RAM, 64MP AI Quad Camera Array, 2cm Macro and 120° ultra-wide sensor, High-performance Helio G90T, LiquidCool Technology, Wifi X Antenna,16.58cm (6.53) Dot Notch HDR Display, 500-nits max brightness, Alexa Built-in, 4500mAh high-capacity battery, Type-C 18W Fast Charger, 20MP AI Front Camera, AI Portrait Mode, AI Scene Detection, Helio G90T gaming processor for gaming and is carrier unlocked for use on any cellphone network. Long story short, my friend ultimately sold me on this one. Even though Redmi might not be a recognizable name here in the U.S. it's a major player in the China/India telecommunication markets. Which basically means they can sell their product for a fraction of the cost due to high volume sales and low production costs.

26720,B07Y8XK9GC,Antonio Borges,5,16-Dec-19,True,Does almost everything a brand name smartphone can do at a fraction of the price!,"As an iPhone owner for 10+ years, I grew tired and frustrated of spending absurd amounts of money everytime a new model came out or the one I was using became obsolete. Not to mention the frustration of how expensive repairs are as well. Due to this I decided to cross the pond and switch to Android under the insistence of my friends saying that Android is ""better"" and ""cheaper"" than Apple. So I decided to research phones, but immediately found out that top notch Android phones are as expensive as it's fruity competitor. Overwhelmed, I called a friend to talk about my dilemma and he said ""you need to get a Redmi Note Pro"". I was like ""Redmi, who?"" Well let me tell you, the Redmi Note Pro 8 sports the following specs: Dual SIM Card Slot, 64 GB (expandable), 6 GB RAM, 64MP AI Quad Camera Array, 2cm Macro and 120° ultra-wide sensor, High-performance Helio G90T, LiquidCool Technology, Wifi X Antenna,16.58cm (6.53) Dot Notch HDR Display, 500-nits max brightness, Alexa Built-in, 4500mAh high-capacity battery, Type-C 18W Fast Charger, 20MP AI Front Camera, AI Portrait Mode, AI Scene Detection, Helio G90T gaming processor for gaming and is carrier unlocked for use on any cellphone network. Long story short, my friend ultimately sold me on this one. Even though Redmi might not be a recognizable name here in the U.S. it's a major player in the China/India telecommunication markets. Which basically means they can sell their product for a fraction of the cost due to high volume sales and low production costs. If your looking for a decent, cost effective alternative to all the expensive smartphones out there, this is the one for you. At around $250 this phone is a winner!",2.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro (64GB, 6GB) 6.53"", 64MP Quad Camera, Helio G90T Gaming Processor, Dual SIM GSM Unlocked - US & Global 4G LTE International Version (Pearl White, 64 GB)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Camera-Gaming-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B07Y8XK9GC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717jdCOqv6L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Y8XK9GC,148,216.0,0.0

Has good quality build and feel. Screen quality is great. The IMUI is ok but needs improvement. Adding a launcher will help but it's nothing to gripe about. I got the 128 gb rom which is pretty good for only $15 from the 64gb. As far as network, I'm still using my AT&T go phone Sim card and it's working fine. Battery life is OK but with moderate use it could be better. I usually have to put on charge at the end of day. The camera takes great photos during daylight. Very crisp and detailed shots. The back is also glass so I would definitely use a case. Overall, very satisfied.

25369,B07T7MM64L,Amazon Customer,5,15-Aug-19,True,Incredible Value! OnePlus 7 on a budget...,"I had a Pixel 3A and my sister dropped her phone so started doing a search on something budget. The Pixel 3A didn't have the same deal I got it under 2 months ago so I sort of defaulted to Motorola. Came across this on Amazon and was somewhat skeptic at first. Started reading up on it and saw some great reviews. It had more then what I needed and seemed a little big for what I like (I prefer the size of the iPhone, that's really my favorite feature of the iPhone) but then again so are all Android phones these days and seems like everyone likes those so figured let's give it a shot. Order it before lunch, arrived before dinner same day. I just set it up and it's a really nice looking device, like it even better then the OnePlus 7. I don't use covers with my phones but the cover that came with it I actually will be using that, it fits so seamlessly and doesn't seem cheap in anyway. Complements the device really well. The UI is not what I'm used to and will use a 3rd party launcher as a work around. It's a little hefty for people who care about that, but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a device even if your budget is around the $500 mark I think you'll enjoy this device more then what's available in that range even. The only comp I can think of is the OnePlus 7 which is a great device but not the bargain value it used to be.

20296,B07H41NB46,Nathan Dumas,4,15-Apr-19,True,It's three hundred dollars!! What?! -- Updated to reflect usage ---,"Ahh, the Pocophone. A $300 masterfully crafted piece of hardware polished with minimal and functional software. True to it's Specs, it performs like a six cylinder turbo. Water-cooled Flagship processor, 6gb of RAM, and a massive 128gb of storage. This easily compares to a $700+ Flagship phone. Sometimes I like to download the most graphically intensive game and play, just too bast in 60fps on my phone. This thing can probably handle PS3 graphics. They're out of this world. The physical feel I grew to like. Some reviews pointed out, some even bitterly, that it doesn't have the feel of a flagship. It's a combination of hardened plastic and glass. For he price point, it's very workable; it feels solid. You're really holding a phone. The software I was a little nervous about. I had come from a Samsung, where they thought everything through meticulously and thoroughly. What I found was the Pocophone was just as well thought out, if not better. Everything runs butter smooth, and all the features that makes everything easier and enjoyable are quietly hidden in the corner. They did a fantastic job, and it shows. Sadly there are downsides. Not just sacrifices that have to be made, but what feels like engineering shortcuts. The facial recognition doesn't work in the United States. (The thumbprinter works fluidly, so that makes up for it.) And the largest is the phone lacks the capability to transmit and receive a very specific widespread 4G frequency. This is very noticeable, and it's sad that Xioami over-looked it. It's at times unusable, and at times slow to the point of frustrating. I don't really go any where, but it's definitely an issue. The final note is the quality of the ports, where there's a major issue. When I received the phone, it had trouble charging. The cord had to be plugged in delicately and be left untouched in order for it to charge. At first, I thought this was a quark of USB-C, but alas, it's just the quality of the port. After four months of use, there's now an issue with the audio jack. I pulled a plug out [with no more force then you would any other cord] and heard a small click. Now the headphone jack is having issue; it, too, much be delicately placed, which can be extremely frustrating and almost makes listening to headphones impossible. Over all, this phone is mind bending. Absolutely astonishing beyond its price point. If it weren't for the audio jacks, it'd be the perfect phone. I can't wait for Pocophones next iteration, and hope Xiaomi pays more attention to it's state-side customers. - Written on my Pocophone F1",4.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Pocophone F1 128GB Graphite Black, Dual Sim, 6GB RAM, Dual Camera, 6.18"", GSM Unlocked Global Model, No Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Pocophone-Graphite-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07H41NB46,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71q3UGwZhcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07H41NB46,237,314.5,0.0

19570,B07FM9913M,A. Swenk,5,14-Jul-19,True,Works Really Well for the Price,"I ordered this after several phone mishaps. My old Galaxy S7 had finally died in about December of last year, and I was shopping around for a new phone. I blew through two phones that I had bought for around this price point (in fact, I think a little more expensive) that had been really disappointing. Long story short, neither lasted much longer than a month before becoming completely unusable. I was shopping around a lot for a phone that could do the job for a low price point (as I'm sure you can imagine, going through two phones in a few months shreds your finances), and I found this. After using it everyday for the past two months or so, I can wholly recommend it. Keep in mind that it does sacrifice some bells and whistles. It does not have NFC, for example. But if that's something you can live without, then this is a great phone. It has a modern design with a clean, simple, and chic look. The camera is pretty good, and in my experience, the fingerprint sensor works really, really well. The microphone and speaker are decent quality and work well, all things considered. It doesn't really heat up unless you're really pushing it with some graphically-demanding games, as is the case for many phones. I have found that the battery life also is good. For casual use (texting semi-regularly, making some calls, some casual games and browsing the internet) it has consistently lasted a full day on a single charge for me. If I am doing more with it (playing more graphically-demanding games/ taking lots of pictures or video on top of what I mentioned before), then I might need to recharge it at some point during the mid-afternoon. It does charge pretty quickly. Couple things to note that aren't inherently negatives, but are maybe different from the mainstream phones you might be used to. - The light. It has a light that lights up for notifications and when charging (which is pretty standard) but this light is pretty bright compared to more mainstream phone lights. If you're a light-sensitive sleeper (like me) it's probably better to charge it away from your bed at night, or simply put it face-down. - The sounds. The sounds for notifications or getting a call are different and perhaps a bit more jarring. I don't really mind because I've always kept my phones on vibrate, but if you're a sound person that could take some getting used to. - The battery saver mode. The battery saver mode itself works well, but it does turn the interface where the home/back buttons are a bright, jarring red. This caught me by surprise the first time I turned it on. Luckily, the battery life is good enough where you won't need to turn on battery-saver often, but this is something to be aware of. Overall, this a good, sleek, modern phone that works well and can handle most of anything you have to throw at it, even if it is a bit quirky.",1.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

21458,B07JMPGNHK,Orrin,5,13-Mar-19,True,VALUE AT IT'S BEST,"This phone is unbelievable for it's price. The experience I had with this phone is very much similar to using an Iphone 10. it's smooth, the camera is solid especially if you know a thing or two about photography. The speaker is amazing. The screen is sharp rich and blacks are really black almost like a Oled. Battery life is great too also supports quick charging. No IR Blaster on this one. Also supports face-unlock but region must be set to a supporting region. Finger print reader very fast. Navigation gestures and recent app screen very similar to IPhone which is great. The UI is also to me pretty and well designed. The phone is glass black and front and feels just like any other premium device. Gaming is not a problem doesn't matter which game except fortnite which isn't supported due to gpu. Upgradeable to android 9 pie. Option available to map power button to google assistant which is awesome. No NFC thus cannot make mobile payments. Also no wireless charging. Uses a usb type C port.

24449,B07QK32C8M,Ian C,3,13-Aug-19,True,"A lot of potential, but not quite there","After doing a bit of research I decided on this phone to replace an hold Honor 8 that I’ve been using with Metro PCS. My first impression is that the hardware was excellent, especially at this price point and the proprietary operating system was a bit buggy, but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me. Pros: Excellent battery life Good cameras, especially at this price point Fast finger print reader Decent build quality Cons: Does not support many U.S. LTE bands (cross check with your carrier) Screen brightness is good, but the screen is very reflective making it difficult to see in bright light Screen appears to have a polarizing filter, meaning if you are wearing polarized sunglasses you will NOT be able to see the screen when holding the phone horizontally. This is very inconvenient, especially for taking horizontal photos on bright days. Audio quality when using headphones is not as good as other phones I have owned Intermittent issues with vibration alerts Proprietary MIUI works well enough but it can be buggy and inconsistent at times After using it for a few days I started to notice a few of the issues noted above that I unfortunately just can’t get past so I will be returning the phone. For me, the biggest issue is band compatibility for Metro PCS. I’m not very well versed in mobile lingo but I read many reviews that stated it worked well with Metro. I would say it works okay but I found that it did not work as well as my old Honor 8. After doing a bit more research I discovered that Metro operates it’s LTE service on six different bands. This phone only supports two of those six and the Honor supports three of the six. The one band that the Honor supports that this one doesn’t is band 12, which I understand helps with cell reception indoors and in some rural areas. I like the phone enough that I would be willing to accept the other flaws I mentioned but the poor reception compared to my old phone is a deal breaker for me. It’s an awesome phone if it works well on your network, but do your research and make sure it supports the bands you need.",3.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 128GB + 4GB RAM 6.3"" FHD+ LTE Factory Unlocked 48MP GSM Smartphone (Global Version, No Warranty) (Space Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Warranty/dp/B07QK32C8M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Hc4HmwwbL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07QK32C8M,229,176.94,0.0

19558,B07FM9913M,SEK,5,12-Sep-19,True,Buy without hesitation.,"When I bought this phone I did not have high expectations. The idea was to use it during my overseas vacation and if I did not like it, no big loss because it was so inexpensive (1/4 of the price of the cheapest iPhone). From the moment I tore the seal and opened the box, however, I realized that I may have been wrong. The phone came with a factory case, the build looked superb and the body was thin and light. The first impression turned into a total surprise when I set it up and put a Metro PCS SIM in it. The experience was flawless. In my opinion, Android One is the finest operating system around without exceptions (my work phone is an iPhone 8 Plus). There is no bloatware and it receives all updates from Google, not Xiaomi. Soon after I bought it, the operating system was upgraded to Android 9, again directly by Google. I am yet to see a single app whose Android version is different or inferior to the iOS version. The user experience is identical, which helped me switch seamlessly between the two operating systems on my two phones. One Android feature that I was not aware of but liked very much is the unlimited backup of the phone by Google (no iCloud like space limitations and no need to do the backup through a computer program like iTunes). The Mi A2 is fast, the phone reception and data speeds are excellent, the screen is sharp and bright, the video and games are smooth, the camera is better than my work phone, the speaker is clear, the fingerprint reader is logically placed in the back and very fast despite the claim in one of the negative reviews (at least as fast as my work phone), the battery lasts a full day of heavy usage (half of the time using video) and two days of normal usage, and charges faster than any smartphone that I have ever owned (Android or iPhone). The phone does not have a notch at the top, which is a big plus. Knowing what I know now I would buy it again without hesitation.",2.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

It works great on Cricket/ATT and I get LTE all the way up in Western Upstate New York. The sides are plastic but they are very tough and with a case you won't even notice. And as far as cases go, the one in the box doesn't really cover much of the camera bump and it's kinda meh quality overall so I bought the matte black Anccer style case for $10 and am super pleased with how it makes the phone feel/look. The phone is fast, no real lag to speak of, and is only just a hair slower than my One plus 6t. The camera is crisp and takes great photos, also on par with my 6t, but if you install GCam the photos are even better. Yes, there are ads. But you can turn them off, despite what the other reviewer said. There's an option to do so as you're setting up the phone and you can turn them off within the apps own settings as well if you missed that option. There are some ads in the theme store but they're an inch tall, only show up once, and you can X out of them immediately or just not use the xiaomi theme store.

19649,B07FM9913M,Misael Valdez,4,12-Mar-19,True,Best Budget Phone in this price range hands down!,"2 week review: I have been wanting to try Xiaomi for about over a year already because of all the great things I've heard about them. I'm a Samsung user since the Galaxy S2 but been a Note owner since since the Note 4. My Note 9 got stolen about a month ago and stupid Samsung Premium Care does NOT cover theft or loss. So I was stuck without my beautiful Note 9 and the hefty price tag that I still have to pay off. Anyways. . . about the Xiaomi Mi A2. I was very skeptical about getting this but the perfect time to get it after my phone was stolen.. Thought about it long and hard. I watched various YouTube review videos and it had nothing but great things about it. Debated between the Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Mi A2 Lite and everything pointed towards this. The set up was so easy and with the Android One UI, it felt very familiar. I love the Android One UI because it is so smooth and simple. The screen is actually very crisp and sharp. Colors look nice and touch screen is smooth and seamless. Only issue is that it can be a little difficult to see outdoors in direct sunlight but it's not to the point you can't see or read your screen. The Snapdragon 660 Chipset is very smooth. I have not had the phone glitch on me at all. I am a heavy PES (soccer game) user and it has been flawless while playing. The battery life is good when I'm not playing PES a lot but I do wish it had a larger capacity. It has rapid charging technology and charges so quickly that it doesn't really bother me. Battery from 5:30am until I get home around 6pm usually is around the 20%. The camera is good not great (comparing it to the Note 9 though). That is the one thing I would say I miss the most about my Note 9. Besides that, I really don't see myself missing the Note 9 that much. Especially at this price! If this phone continues to perform well and hold up nicely, I can see myself purchasing one of Xiaomi's higher end devices in the $400-$500 range with better camera's and processors and saying goodbye to overly priced Samsung Phones. I do recommend paying the extra $50 and getting the one with 128GB of memory and 6GB of RAM. I do find sometimes that my apps will refresh and reboot when I go back to them if I've opened a few apps. The 6GB RAM will help with keeping apps that you're going back and forth to open where you left off. So the only real cons about this phone is no wireless charging, no NFC and the battery capacity. Besides that, I highly recommend this phone to anyone and would not hesitate to buy it. Works great here in Phoenix, AZ on T-Mobile network by the way! I get 40+ Mbps at my house so it's very good.",3.0,Xiaomi,"Unlocked GOLD Xiaomi Mi A2, 4GB 64GB, Dual SIM standby, Global Version, 5.5 inch Smartphone Android One, Dual Rear 12.0MP Camera Snapdragon 625",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-64GB-4GB-5-99-International/dp/B07FM9913M,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w4AKhyLzL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07FM9913M,453,159.49,0.0

If you absolutely need WiFi calling at work, this phone won't work for you. 1. Display is just perfect, bright and beautiful with no ugly front camera cutouts. 2. Sliding the phone by default opens the selfie camera, but customizable to any other app. 3. There is a separate button on the side of the phone (like Bixby), which is completely customizable as well. 4. I love how fast the finger print scanner works in this phone. Overall phone operation speed and app launching/operation is faster than my Google Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy note 9. 5. Always on display (AOD) works as expected most of the time (it tends to move up on the screen and turns off in low light conditions). 6. There is a small message indicator light which flashes white light. 7. There is a Edge Glow (similar to Samsung Galaxy phones) feature which is supposed to only work when you receive notifications and AOD is off. I noticed the glow on occasion with AOD on and now I am using a android app ""Always On Edge - Edge Lighting"" to further customize and use the feature. 8. The phone ships with a plastic phone case/10W wireless charger base/Type C-3.5 mm adapter cable. 9. Camera in this phone is one of the best in the business (especially in low light). 10. Battery appears to be on the smaller side but I have had no issues with moderate use (over 60% left from morning to bed time). 11. Ceramic back is beautiful but a fingerprint magnet ; I am still using the phone without a case, which makes it a bit slippery; I placed a back protector clear film which did not help with the fingerprints but a bit easy to hold. 12. Phone is ~10 grams heavy compared to the Samsung Galaxy note, but it has a great balance and well made feel. You will notice it in the front shirt pocket for few days after the initial use (especially with a case). 13. There is a small movement of the screen in the top left corner (when you tap), due to the slider mechanism, which is barely noticeable. 14. MIUI launcher/ software is very smooth and I never felt the need to root the phone and install vanilla android version. I just changed the defaults for the browser/text apps to google. There is a drop down menu similar to any android with a screenshot toggle. 15. MIUI gives you only two sound options Regular (audible ring)/Silent. Silent mode can be programmed to vibrate; I wish Xiaomi makes it simple with sound/vibrate/silent modes with next SW update. There is a Do not disturb (DND) mode which can be programmed. 16. The stock ""vibration intensity"" is very low compared to Samsung or Google phones. It is easy to miss a notification or call when the phone is inside the pocket especially with a case. I don't know if any apps can let you change the vibration intensity without rooting. 17. So far, I love everything about the phone which is made better than any other android at any cost. If I drop the phone and break the display, I may not easily find a replacement screen in the local store. For ~$550 phone cost compared to ~$900 I spent on Samsung/Google phones, I am taking that risk. Update 8/19: I am using the phone with Google Fi without any issues. When you sign up for Google Fi, choose any listed Xiaomi model and Google will send the SIM card free. Once you insert the SIM into Mi MIX3 it will prompt you for downloading the Google Fi app and activates the account. Google Fi works exclusively with T-mobile with MI MIX3 and while WiFi calling is not working, WiFi texting is working very well with the native android texting app. I am not even using the Google Hangouts.",77.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi MI Mix 3 (128GB, 6GB) 6.39"" Display, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Unlocked Multi-Functional Magnetic Slider Smartphone w/Wireless Charging Pad (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Unlocked-Multi-Functional-Magnetic-Smartphone/dp/B07N6N7JP3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QLhYeA2+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N6N7JP3,79,0.0,0.0

20901,B07HK4JNV1,C. Nauer,5,12-Apr-19,True,Great Phone... Died Two Months In,"A beautiful powerhouse of a phone. I've never been so spoiled rotten with such long battery life (I went out for my usual PoGo walk and wasn't even close to needing a charge - I was walking around with three external power packs with my old phone just in case and usually went through my biggest one or my two smaller ones). Split screen worked great, apps ran smoothly. Apps started up so fast I barely realized they were starting up. Nice, large screen. I LOVED this phone. Only downside is that I could not see the screen at all if I was wearing sunglasses. There was really no difference in the brightness settings. But hands down, this is the best phone I've ever used. (To be fair, I do usually stick with the ""cheaper"" brands. I used Blu Studio for a couple versions, downgraded to a cheap tracfone, and am currently using a Huawei - which has more of the features I want but is not as good of a phone.) One other thing that did bother me with the phone that appears to be a feature in many smartphones now is how the alarm starts quiet and slowly gains volume. I need an alarm that just immediately blares and shocks me awake or else I'll likely be late to work. I didn't see a setting to change that, so that is something I'd like to see, as well as some change in the screen. Guessing the screen might be led instead of oled or amoled. However, unfortunately likely due to the seller giving me a refurbished phone without properly checking it, the screen totally died two months into use... conveniently a mere two days after the return period ended. Could absolutely be a coincidence, but it's definitely suspect. Unfortunately, I took my phone to one of the two local repair shops that could even look at Redmi's and they said they could not get a hold of a screen for it. Other shop had bad reviews, so I checked out getting a screen for myself. Only option was to wait a month, as I'm in the US. A month is a long time to not have a phone these days, so fortunately amazon processed a return for me, and I switched over to a Huawei. I'd love to return to a Xiaomi, but I'm not sure it's worth it due to the lack of technical support available here.",6.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro 64GB / 4GB RAM 6.26"" Dual Camera LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone Global Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-Version/dp/B07HK4JNV1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517Q3-wHBkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HK4JNV1,441,179.5,0.0

If you do not need the fastest data connections and you mostly use your phone indoors, this is the phone to purchase. If the phone would have had a better connection to 4G networks in my location I would kept this phone hands down. I returned the phone due to the 4G connection issues I was having. Pros: -It is a really nice looking phone and it is really thin. -It is super light and the design overall is very nice. -The screen is very colorful especially for a LCD screen. -The performance is great even after installing a few dozen apps. I never experienced any slow downs or hiccups. I was really impressed by how fast this phone was considering that it has a snapdragon 660. I am not a super heavy user but I do use my phone a lot for media and some games. -Fast charger is awesome! Cons: -The screen is dim in direct sunlight or outside on a cloudy day even at full brightness. -No LTE but it has 4G, which is still really fast but not as fast as LTE. -The phone had trouble staying connected to 4G networks and would often connect to H (HSDPA) instead, which is really 3.5G. I would have to restart the phone in order for it to connect to 4G networks, which got annoying quickly. This continued to happen even after I selected that I preferred 4G netowrks in the settings. I also tried this in 2 locations about 80 miles apart and the same issue occurred. -The battery life was pretty good but it could use a bit more juice.

20895,B07HK4JNV1,Sophie,1,11-Mar-19,True,An exercise in minor frustrations,"Recently broke my Moto G5 plus and replaced it with this, mostly pretty happy. Wish the LED indicator was colored. I find the notch a bit annoying because it limits the notification indicators. The battery display is great and the screen itself is really pretty. The battery lasts through my 12 hour shift just fine. I don't know if it's my new network or if the antenna is worse but I don't get service inside the warehouse like my old phone did. I recommend changing the launcher if you don't like a cluttered home screen since the default doesn't have an app drawer. Edit after a few weeks: The phone often ""forgets"" how to use mobile data. Turning off data and turning it back on doesn't even work. I have to fully restart the phone. It is a pain in the butt when I just wanna quickly look something up. Last week the audio randomly stopped working for no reason until a restart. It often has a second of two of delay before the screen turns on when you press the button. I do not recommend buying this phone. It is full of minor quirks and your money can be better spent elsewhere. update: After two months it completely broke and won't turn on.

The battery life is excellent, it works with Android Auto in my car, the camera is decent, and the phone is fast thanks to the 4Gb of RAM and the mid-range 8-core processor. Best of all, it's Android One, so it has been receiving monthly security updates, and was automatically updated to Android P. Even under all-day use, it's rarely below 60% battery at the end of the day, thanks to the massive 4000mAh battery. The fingerprint reader works consistently and reliably.

Great look and feel. Great performance. The apps and internet too fast. Camera is good with this price. Fast charging. One disadvantage I noticed was there is no headphone jack but adaptor included.

Xiaomi MIUI customization is trash. Xiaomi should just use pure Android. The default camera app leaves a water mark on all photos by default, but it can be turned off. The MIUI apps like the camera app can't be uninstalled. There seems no way to turn off charging sounds other than deleting the audio files. Not only that, but the charging notification sound plays even when you have sound off. If you using the phone while charging or have a weak charger it will constantly go off.

23803,B07Q26V49K,Josy,5,11-Aug-19,True,Above and beyond beautiful amazing phone for cheap price.,"I got this phone after having an LG V20 with replaceable batteries and it's been great. Have had this for a month and it's been great. Bought It for about 180$ Us dollars. My phone lasts all day fine. I usually go to work with 100% or 90% and it will be about 60% when I get back after an 8 hour day where I use my phone quite a good amount even with GPS or Bluetooth on. The camera is fantastic. Not like a pixel but for at this price it's great. It will def do the job if you're just taking casual photos for social media. I even take pictures for work and they come out great. Videos aren't as good but it's fine. The 48mp doesn't really do much. I don't use it much so I don't see a difference. Fingerprint scanner works like a charm and super fast unless ur fingers are watery/dirty. ONE CON I've had so far is that bc it's a xiaomi phone that's not that known it isn't fully supported by my cricket provider. It does work where I can call and text. But the find my phone doesnt find the Sim card since it's not fully protected. So u can't use that feature. And maybe some others. When I text people for the first time it doesn't show that I sent a text. It just ""dissapears"" and then later they will reply saying they got it but just later. But after the first text to someone new it works fine. Everything runs so smoothly and fast. I can scroll around and open apps so fast and smoothly. It's very beautiful. I got the blue/red one so the back looks beautiful but no my case covers it up. With the case people keep asking me if it's an IPhone tho. Everyone jokingly says it's a fake IPhone. But that can't be true or else my phone would have cracks on the screen and my battery would die within 2 hours. dropped it twice so far No damage.

Now it's stuck on Android One logo. I contacted Xiaomi's support who said they do not offer any support here, so I contacted Global Support also from Xiaomi, they gave me some instructions to try to restore it, but nothing worked, so they just told me to contact the seller. I contacted Amazon's Support, but once again, they weren't able to fix the issue and told me that the 30 days return window is already closed, so I contacted directly the seller, they verified my order and told me once more that the 30 days return window is closed and they can not do anything, they suggested me to go to a cellphone repair shop. So, after less than two months I have a death smartphone with no warranty or support at all.

23563,B07PY52GVP,Meruccubus,2,10-May-19,True,"Incredible value, but device defective","My device happened to be defective, namely in that plugging it into my computer never worked. I'd have to manually alter files and settings from my PC in order to be able to view the device's folders and upload files to it. Installing drivers and Xiaomi's applications did not help this problem. It might be a exception, but it still warranted a return. For $200 the build quality is good, glass screen and back with noticeable weight and a good overall shape. The sides are plastic, but sturdy. Only the buttons really stood out to me as ""cheap,"" but again, for $200 it's nothing terrible. The vibration unit built into the phone is probably the cheapest feeling part, and I ultimately disabled it because it just felt... off. It's quite a chunky, bulky vibration, not a smooth and constant shake from more expensive devices like Apple of Samsung. The operating system is smooth, responsive, and intuitive. There's no dark mode however. It's also crammed with bloatware from both Xiaomi and Google, some of which is more useful than others. Battery life is solid from my time using it, and the camera was good, again, for a $200 phone. I keep mentioning ""for $200"" because that's what you should be keeping in mind with this device. It's a budget phone, not a flagship or flagship killer. And for $200, it's a VERY good phone. Had mine not had the issues it did, it would easily be a 4.5/5 or even 5/5 for the money.

Speaker is nothing special. 4000mah battery gives insane battery life, at least 10hrs screen on which ends up lasting me over 2 full days average on a full charge using Bluetooth earbuds for music and YouTube videos and Twitter or web browsing etc. Notch is very pleasing imo. Camera protrudes a bit from frame but not too serious. MIUI is as good as ever. Getting LTE bands with T-Mobile northeast US. In terms of screen, slight backlight bleed on top edge nothing crazy, bottom bezel is a lot larger than I realized but still overall good screen to body ratio. Fairly bright quality display but it's not oled, budget phone for a reason. One of the big differences between mi9 is plastic sides, but the note 7 feels ""premium"" and other than the lower conductive properties of plastic vs metal you can't really tell the difference. Very satisfying feel in hand but it's a stretch to reach top corner even with larger hands. Not Thanos approved(slightly top heavy) Obviously structural integrity is weaker but you can see durability tests, so don't go hitting this with a hammer. Gorilla glass 5 is some serious stuff though, and mine's already survived multiple chest high drops without a scratch so far.

23788,B07Q26V49K,Dominic Anfuso,4,1-Jun-19,True,Very nice build quality,"This is my first Xiaomi/Redmi phone and its a pretty sweet piece. Things that aren't as good as my previous phone (blade zmax) are touch sensitivity I mainly notice when typing so it could just be SwiftKey isn't a good match? Too early to tell. The battery and/or screen time is great. It's 9:40 pm and I've been driving with GPS on all day and I still have 20% left and well over 6 hours SOT. I was a little annoyed with the navigation keys but thankfully they can be replaced with gestures I.e. swipe left to go back, swipe up for home and swipe up and hold for recent apps...plus you get the added screen real estate with the buttons gone. I downloaded Google Camera and without getting super technical yet with settings it takes great pics, I'm anxious to try night mode. Fingerprint sensor is much better than my last phone, very accurate. Screen scrolling is buttery smooth, I'm sure all these new Xiaomi phones will have an edge but for me I'm not ready to plop down $3-500 on a phone. One other thing I like about this is the width, my previous phone in hindsight was a little too big. I can actually reach across the whole screen when typing without potentially/probably dropping it. Another negative is I do lose coverage and data in some locations and/or buildings. I'm on Metro in the northeast. Most of the time though there are no issues and lte is readily available. For the price it beats any Metro phone you'd get in the store imo. *edit* after more use I got it down to 11% and got just about 8.5 hours SOT that's pretty impressive and I haven't even unlocked/tweaked it yet.",5.0,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, 64GB/4GB RAM, 6.30'' FHD+, Snapdragon 660, Blue - Unlocked Global Version, No Warranty",https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-64GB-Snapdragon/dp/B07Q26V49K,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FBnbqW3pL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Q26V49K,471,166.0,299.99

One for receipt of the item. Then a few day later an e-mail tell me the phone was fixed and on its way back to me. Then another e-mail asking me for password information which I did not have because I had set up a finger print scan when I set the phone up. I replied that I could not sent them the information they wanted. I talked to a SquarTrade individual again about this. He sent me an e-mail telling me I could speak with him just reply to his e-mail with a time and phone number for him to call. He did not return the call. I received another e-mail telling me the phone was repaired and on the way back to me. Yesterday the package arrived, my wife signed for it. Today I opened the box and looked at the phone and it was in the same condition as when I sent it to them. I called SquareTrade and they said it was a software issue and are refunding the cost of the SquareTrade policy. I'm furious and have no where to turn to.

Sometimes if you have a lot of things open and haven't cleared the cache in a while, the phone will start to noticeably bog down, mostly on lock/unlock phone commands and responsiveness of the on-screen home/return/assistant buttons.

Touch screen: The screen on this phone looks great, really crisp and colorful. It is dim for out door use though. But it's just bright enough for me to use as a GPS in my car just fine. The touch sensitivity on the screen could be better. When my wife uses my phone she always comment on how big and beautiful the screen is, but also how the touch sensitivity could be better.
