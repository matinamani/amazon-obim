They advised that after the factory reset, the phone would go back to original and get rid of whatever the problem was. They assured me it would not be a recurring issue. I reset and thankfully my info was still backed up and my phone was restored. Kept the phone. It's October 18th and I'm back in love with this phone! I am so upset. I ordered this phone August 26th and LOVED it. Everything was amazing! On September 8th it quick working. I am only happy that it did this in the span of time for me to get my money back.

10203,B01LY3OB8D,Joe Smart,1,9-May-17,False,Disappointing,"This may be the worst premium phone ever made. On the first hot Summer day in Chicago, the phone overheated and shut down three separate times. I contacted Google support and they claimed there wasn't anything wrong with my phone and e-mailed a list of what they consider legitimate (meaning the warranty doesn't apply) reasons why this might happen on the Pixel XL. I've had 100.00 phones and 300.00 phones and 500.00 phones and a 600.00 phone but before the Pixel XL, I never owned a phone that repeatedly shut down because I used the GPS on a hot day. The phone reception is pretty lousy compared with other phones that I've owned. The speakers sound tinny. The battery life is disappointing. The battery runs hot (90-100F) when the phone is idle and sitting in an air-conditioned room. Pixel support is useless. The Pixel XL is at best a 300.00 phone marked up obscenely with a build quality that is obviously lousy compared to genuine premium phones. If you buy one of these things you will probably regret it. This is the response I got when I complained about the phone overheating and shutting down: Hi Joe, Thanks for contacting Google Support! This email is in regards to the chat conversation we are having right now, as discussed, once you roll back to Nougat update, please follow the recommendations below if the issue persists. Your device may warm up with use. Letting the device ‘take a break’ from use or limiting/turning off features (even those running in the background) could remedy the situation. Here are some tips/suggestions: Media apps (music, video games) 1) Close or turn off other apps and features that you're not using; they may be running in the background. 2) Discontinue using the media temporarily until the temperature normalizes. User-installed apps 1) Put the device in safe-mode to disable 3rd party apps and see if the issue improves. 2) Try uninstalling recently installed apps to pinpoint the app causing the issue. Display brightness 1) Manually setting the brightness to be very bright may contribute to higher device temperature. 2) Consider setting to auto brightness to manually reducing the brightness setting. GPS / 3G / WiFi - prolonged data connectivity 1) Turn off feature when not in use. 2) Stop or limit use and allow device to cool down if it gets warm. Exposure to direct heat 1) Remove from heat and keep away from direct heat or excessive sunlight. Poor ventilation 1) Expose the device rather than keeping it tucked away in poor ventilated/tight areas (layers, small pockets, bags). Cases 1) Don't use a case that covers the front and back of the device. 2) Use official case (available on Google Store in some countries). Chargers 1) Don't use unofficial chargers which can overcharge and degrade the battery. 2) Use official charger (available on Google Store in some countries). Daydream View 1) Daydream View requires high performance from the device. The device's temperature should stay within safe limits. 2) Remove any protective cases from the device to improve thermal ventilation. 3) If your device feels too hot, stop using Daydream View and allow the device to cool down. Android Wear 1) Power off the device for 5-10 minutes and turn it on again. 2) Try using the watch for another day to see if your issue improves. If your watch is still warm after a day, reply to this email and let us know.

My personal phone and my work phone are on the same cellular carrier, so that shouldn't be the root of any of the problems with the Pixel 3. My old $150 budget phone outperforms the Pixel 3 in every way that I use a phone. I use the Pixel 3 for only 4 things: calls, texts, navigation, and email. I have very few apps on this phone, but the battery barely lasts a day, and I've tried to turn down the brightness, disable unused apps, etc, but nothing seems to solve the poor battery life. There is also some crazy lag in the driving navigation. I've missed a few turns due to the extreme lag. One time I was at a stoplight, and the Pixel 3 said ""In 1000 feet, turn right."" The right turn was supposed to be for the intersection I was already sitting at. I thought maybe some of the problems were due to the phone being so new and downloading updates or something while I was trying to use it, but after a couple months it still has terrible lag. I'm also unable to read some of my emails because the Pixel 3 will automatically undo scrolling for some reason, and you should do an internet search about this issue, I'm not the only one having this problem. There are a ton of other little irritations that have made me want to put this phone in the garbage can, but I don't remember them right now.

16009,B0767538YH,Michaelle Bown,5,9-Feb-18,False,Best Phone I've Used,"I’ve had the Google Pixel 2 XL for about two months now, and I can honestly say that it is the best phone that I have ever had, and that’s coming from an Apple enthusiast. I bought the 2 XL after having owned the IPhone 4 and 5s. Apples IPhone’s don’t even compare to Google’s Pixel 2 XL, and here’s why. Let’s start with the screen. Sporting the latest OLED panel made by Samsung, the Pixel 2 XL can achieve some of the darkest blacks and brightest whites on the market. Due to the massive 6.2-inch OLED screen, a bluish haze can appear, which is a common problem with OLED screens. Honestly, it’s not very noticeable unless you are really looking for it. Today’s smartphones are becoming bezelless, meaning the front of the phone is virtually all usable screen (see picture below). The Pixel 2’s small bezels are only necessary because of two front-facing speakers that honestly sound crystal clear. They can reach high volumes without distortion, and for someone like me who watches to a lot of YouTube videos and listens to music, I prefer the stereo speakers. The Pixel 2 XL is one of the quickest and most responsive phones on the market. Because Google uses stock Android, paired with 8.1.0 Oreo, opening and closing apps is seamless. Typing gives a very satisfying vibrate and click noise with no lag giving the user a “taptic” feeling. Google Assistant is perfected with the new squeeze function, allowing for the quickest Google searches on any smart device. The rear located fingerprint sensor is placed right where the user’s pointer finger rests, unlocking the phone within the blink of an eye. Supplying power to this device Is one of the biggest batteries ever put into a smartphone. The quick charge of the 3520mAh allows for 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes! In total, I can get about 13 hours on a full charge with about 7 and a half hours of screen-on-time, which is an industry leading statistic! To be honest, I don’t take a whole lot of pictures, but that’s the Pixel 2’s bread and butter. Taking DSL quality pictures with only ONE rear-facing camera is one of the coolest aspects of this phone. Competitors like the Nexus 6P, Galaxy S8 Plus, and IPhone 10 all use a dual lens setup to allow for clear field of depth photos. The Pixel 2 XL’s single-camera does the exact same thing as the competitors, but better. Using software, which in my opinion looks 10 times better than a dual lens setup. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get away from the “Apple hype” but not necessarily transition straight into an android phone. The Pixel 2 Xl is the best of both worlds when it comes to merging the simplicity of an IOS operating system (Apple’s IPhone), and the customizable features of an Android (Samsung’s Galaxy 8) that the phone just feels pretty much perfect. Overall the Pixel 2 XL does everything an IPhone or Samsung does, but better. The screen is arguably the only downside due to the bluing issue; however, the software, google assistant, battery life, camera, and design make the Pixel 2 XL stand out in today’s smartphone market.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0
10194,B01LY3OB8D,George P.,5,9-Feb-17,True,A phone that will set milestones to the others.,"Amazing phone by Google's first attempt to creating a phone from start. HTC built these phones but Google designed and over looked the whole process. I'm a avid Samsung user for the past 7 years and wanted to get my teeth into something different. Not only that, but also wanted to be apart of yet another technical milestone this phone will create. Upping the game for all other manufacturers to do better. Pros and cons on the phone. Pros: Material is metal and Gorilla Glass 4. Not glass covered so their is some texture so the phone won't fly out of your hands if not in a case. Super fast! This phone is quick, fastest processor in the market now for smart phones. Very silky performance. Runs like a Samsung 7 when animation is turned off. If you get the XL, battery life is amazing. The XL comes with a bigger battery and screen of course. We will see how long it lasts, but for now does not get hot at all, and battery life definitely runs over the 8 hour work day with heavy usage. Works flawlessly with Google Play apps, and Google hardware. Chromecast Ultra is awesome with that device, and I'm excited to match this up with Google Home in the near future. Google Assistant is honestly the best verbal command app I've ever seen. Very responsive,and you do not need to speak to it like it is a robot. Can figure out what you want even though you may get a little tongue tide and give a few extra ""ummms"" and 'aaaa's"" she will still pretty much get you to where your going. Kind of a pro and con. You will have to switch all your cords to the USB C connector. Finally did away with the Mini USB that constantly break all the time. Camera is the best I've seen in any phone. Front and back. Stabilisation makes your movies look professional quality. Unlock button at the rear of the phone, placed where your index finger naturally resides is awesome. Fingerprint scanner is super quick and accurate. Cons: No expandable memory. Highly recommend getting the 128gig. Although when you purchase the phone you have access to the Google Cloud service and can save all your HD and 4k media unlimited. Kinda helps the memory. Not water and dust proof. Never a fan of getting my equipment wet regardless if it is OK too, but nice to have just in case. Expensive as hell! Coming in at the same price as the other big two, but is only with one carrier currently Verizon wireless. Hopefully that will change soon because this phone deserves a unlimited plan. Verizon does not offer, but it's easier to afford financing through a data plan. The pro to this when you purchase a US unlocked phone your avoiding all the BS bloatware from service providers.",11.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01LY3OB8D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EfvRF3sHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LY3OB8D,455,185.0,0.0

The speaker volume could be louder and the sound quality of music played or in apps is a little thin. I purchased a Samsung 8 recently and feel the 8’s audio is better, it’s a little faster and gets better WiFi reception than this Pixel Xl. Still, great deal for a 4gb Ram, 128gb storage smartphone. Also, like Google’s native voice assistant as opposed to Samsung’s clunky Bixby. Even though this model is 3 yrs, it’s still a good buy in 2019 for prices found on Amazon. Update - seller suggests return the phone but did not suggest replacing the charger. The phone will fast charge with OEM Samsung Galaxy S8 but Google Pixel type (can’t seem to find a seller who provides genuine OEM Google charger and card) will not work.

My old phone got wet and I went to the phone kiosk in Costco to get a replacement. I remarked on the fairly high cost of the 10e and the salesman suggested the Pixel 3 as an alternative. It was about $300 less than the 10e so I decided to try it. (There is a 90-day return policy when you purchase a phone through Costco.) The phone has a lot of nice features but the deal breaker for me was the sound, or rather the lack of it. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it was nearly impossible to hear the audio (I was trying to listen to a podcast at the gym) anywhere but in a virtually silent environment. Also, incredibly, Google decided not to include a headphone jack but instead to provide a dongle (!!) for connecting headphones via the charging port. Aside from the fact that this is an archaic and clunky implementation, it also tends to stress the charging port. So, an otherwise pretty decent phone is not worth getting, at least in my view.

10027,B01LY3OB8D,ANDRE L. DE GRAAF,5,8-Oct-18,True,Agree that this is the best phone out there and it is getting the latest version of Android when set up.,I love everything about this phone even the styling which many reviewers have criticized. The build quality is excellent and the android experience is super fast. Transfer from my LG G2 was painless and I could really see the difference between the phones once I was up and running. The camera is super fast to focus and now does not leave me frustrated. I can easily take in focus pictures of my non-stop 3 year old. Bought an older phone simply for the cost savings and I don't regret that I bought this phone when the pixel 3 is about to be released. I forgot to mention that the phone updated to Android Pie immediately! So this phone is getting the latest android software updates before any other android devices other than other Pixels!

Nougat is quite possibly the best thing to ever happen to the Nexus/Pixel line of mobile devices because of the software optimizations that are being made on a monthly basis, as well as features that made exclusively for the Pixel phones. This phone runs Google's Pixel Launcher on top of Android, a very lightweight UI that is feature packed and optimized for the hardware inside the phone. Although this phone does have a smaller than average battery, I find myself getting more than 10 hrs of battery life with moderate usage, usually around 3 hours of screen-on time with 40% to spare. Compensating for the small battery is easy to to the wicked fast charging that the Pixel offers, My phone can charge from near dead to 100% in less than 1.5 hours. The 4GB of ram and the underclocked Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor are more than enough for everyday tasks, the phone simply flies though everything. Be sure to invest in the 128GB model though as the 32GB model is just not enough. I usually have about 3GB of free space at any given point in time. The camera on this phone is outstanding due to very fast shutter speeds and fast camera launching, the photos are crisp and colorful but not drenched in color or too exposed. Google also has unlimited photo and video backup for media that originates from the phone, the media that is backed up via Google Photos are stored on Google servers at full quality so that they can be viewed on any device without grain from compression. I highly recommend this device to anybody looking for a blazing fast Android smartphone that recieves the latest Android updates when as soon as they become available for download. Android updates are released monthly for security patches, performance updates, and additional software optimizations.

Google voice activation (""OK Google"") was spotty, only working about 50% of the time, but that was the only real issue in the first year. I would be in my car saying ""OK Google"" over and over like a crazy person trying to get the stupid thing to activate. After 12 months of use the phone went completely haywire. It would shut down randomly, the screen would freeze and I had trouble restarting, the headphone jack wouldn't work, calls would take extended periods of time to connect and then the calls would randomly drop, sometimes I was able to make calls/text but I wasn't receiving incoming calls/texts. I had to restart my phone several a day to resolve these issues. The only way I knew that I wasn't receiving calls/texts is when I would restart my phone and 40+ texts and voicemails would pop up. That was a huge problem for me because I am on-call and use my cell phone to take emergency calls. Fortunately nothing critical happened while my phone was done, but it did cause a bit of a problem. At 13 months I tried a factory restart to no avail so I killed this phone and hope that Google gets their stuff together in some future version.

26829,B07YMNLXL3,Sunny Jassal,5,8-Dec-19,True,Google nailed it!,"Wow! I have been a iPhone user for last 12 years. I was hesitant to move to Android. I have been looking to purchase Pixel since the first release. After 3 years I finally did. I am glad I did. Here are the pros and cons: Pros - Oh so orange is beautiful. Google nailed the color. It's fun and modern. - Phone feels solid. - camera is out of the world. This is the best phone camera that I have ever used - Using the phone is super smooth - keyboard feels amazing to use - switching apps on from the bottom slide is awesome. - going back to previous page with a swipe is awesome - printing from phone has been the easiest. I was never able to print from iPhone. It required AirPrint. - being able to access my files on the phone is an amazing feature - sound on the phone is really good - Google Duo in my opinion is a better product than Facetime - split screen is extremely useful - picture in picture for video is really cool - love the ability to skip songs with a gesture. Comes very handy at work. - time date and weather showing on phone when not using is a brilliant idea - face recognition is super fast - setting up the phone was super easy - Gboard is a life saver Besides the cons below, I think Google nailed this. Cons - have not been able to get Fitbit 3 HR to connect - no headphone jack. Wished Google did not follow the steps of Apple. - no SD card. Stop being like Apple and do the right thing by not limiting people and forcing them to use Cloud services. - search feature not as powerful as Apple - no headphone jack. Once again stop following Apple's crazy marketing ploys. - OTP integration on Apple is better, but I think as the OS matures the feature will eventually be available on Android - my company restricts the use of Gmail so I had to use outlook instead of gmail",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

17328,B0787V183F,FaTHoM,1,8-Dec-18,False,Buy another phone.,"Like a lot of Android based phones, this phone started out as one of the best phones I have ever had. But, of course, as the updates rolled out, it got worse, and worse, and continues to do so. Here are the major downfalls that I wish I had known. -Major touchscreen sensitivity issues. Very frequently won't respond to taps, swipes, or yelling. -The keyboard sits WAY too low on the phone, making it pretty awkward to hold. -Battery issues. I've watched the battery literally drop 10% in less than 5 minutes, doing nothing. -Fingerprint reader. Worked like a dream for the first few months, but doesn't work at all now, even with multiple resets. -Camera. The camera is a joke. If you know anything about photography, or have an eye for a good photo, this phone WILL NOT DELIVER. Colors are always way off, even when changing the lighting settings. You pay $800 for a phone, it better be as good as a DSLR for that price. But, it's not. I had an AT&T Tilt from 2008 that took superior photos. In fact, aost every phone from the last 10 years has taken better photos. -No headphone jack. Idk why Apple started this stupid trend, but it makes no sense. The dongle that comes with it for the 3.5mm headphone plug, broke within a few months, even though it never moved from its home in my home theater cabinet. -Speaker crackling. This is a known issue that they refuse to fix. -It's Google. I was hoping that having the phone not be a major phone manufacturer, it would've been great. Well, then you have all of Google's stupid software on here, like Google photos. Oh, you want to locate a photo in your phone that you took 6 months ago? You can't. Because it's not on your phone. You have go through Google photos, and download it to your phone. What is the point of expandable memory, when everyone streams music, and your photos are apparently not stored on your device? Trying to mess around with uploading photos to Insta? Good luck. Unless you're really tech savvy, you probably won't figure it out. -Screen brightness can be awful. I don't understand why when I'm watching media indoors on my phone with the brightness all the way up, I still can't see, especially during a night scene. The list goes on, and on. Do yourself a favor, and look into the lesser-known-in-America brands, like Huawei. You get way more phone, for less money. Some of them aren't android based, which is a major win (I loathe Apple even more). The positives are. -Expandable memory. Most Android based phones have this, however. -Big screen.

It basically brinks any bio setting for all apps. Yes the phone has facial unlock . It doesn't work if your lieing down or in a dark car . Seems obvious Google didn't figure on this .

I can't in sci fi terms suspend my disbelief and like comic book guy in simpons reviewing his creation. So i say this is crap .my problem is deed is done but I still returned the phone.

At first I liked the phone, but the more I used it the more frustrated I became. I spend a lot of time on conference calls so the phone functionality is very important. The phone functionality is so 'sub-par' compared to Samsung or Blackberry (yes Blackberry), if I was Google I would be embarrassed. Basics like muting and unmuting calls and still having access to the keypad -- not possible. The bluetooth is frustrating how it connects to one device and not another and doesn't default to the wired headset when plugged in. How is prioritizes or selects connections is frustrating (to say the least)! Basic functionality of the phone is not up to the level of what a Samsung was years ago.

15987,B0766TPHSH,Hors D'oeuvre,1,7-Mar-18,False,A Regression from the Progress of the Nexus 6,"Was a Nexus 6 user for four years, and this device feels like many steps back. First and foremost, that display. Looks downright crumby next to a Samsung panel, but the look actually bothered me less than the feel. The screen feels thin and hollow like there's an air bubble trapped behind it. Lo and behold, according to some experts, this is probably due to an inexperienced maker working with Gorilla Glass for the first time. This was enough for me to return the phone within 5 days. Aside from the problematic display, there's no wireless charging and no headphone jack. How is this possible? My 4-year-senior Nexus 6 had a better feel, a headphone jack, and wireless charging! Aren't devices supposed to get better over time? Never thought I'd say it, but now I'm the proud owner of a Samsung. The lack of ""pure android,"" which seems increasingly spy-like, was a reasonable trade-off to retain the feel of a high-quality device, and useful features that are not obsolete. What good are the best photographs if you can't appreciate them with the display? Oh right, Google is connecting the dots between your photographs and your location (against your will) in order to build a VR map of the world.

15961,B0766TPHSH,Jocilyn Wagner,5,7-Jul-18,False,Probably the best phone I've ever owned,"I've been using the Pixel 2 XL Unlocked (from Project Fi) for a couple days shy of 6 months and it's probably been the best phone I've ever owned. I never bought a case for it as they were too expensive and simply threw it into the middle slot in my clutch everyday. I just cleaned the screen and there zero blemishes, with some very minor scratches on one edge of the rear glass. Waterproofing is excellent (I've done quite a bit of photography during thunderstorms) as is the camera for virtually anything i'd need to shoot not requiring a DSLR. The operating system has been updated three times to Android P Beta 3 and all versions have simply flown. I've tried most of the features excepting some of the less-secure smart unlock features. My only complaint is that the screen reader is all but worthless unless you're legit blind and have used multiple Android phones previously. Compared to the iPhone's screen reader, which i've used every night for the past five years to turn fanfics into audiobooks, Android's screen reader may as well be bloatware. Speaking of bloatware, there isn't any and nearly every app i've ever installed has run smooth as butter. I have tried installing 3rd party launchers and at least the Windows Phone launcher works well for what it is, though i can't imagine a need for them. Just now my phone rang and it recognized it as a suspected spam caller and didn't alert me. Battery life is really quite excellent if you follow the battery-saving steps recommended in the settings. Today i shot and then edited about 10 photos in Snapseed and uploaded them and had only lost about 8% power when I was done. Under normal/standby usage i usually get four-five days. Under heavy usage, about three. The always-on screen is terrific and well-designed to be read in any light. The Now Playing feature that Google used to advertise this phone works maybe 5% of the time? The concept needs work and the offline micro-database powering it is too small to be useful for any style of music. The biometric sensors are terrific and if you take your phone with you everywhere you'll never have to ""start a workout"" and still have excellent statistics (I recommend exporting them to Exist.io as the Google Fit app is designed for the lowest common denominator with little functionality). I have no use for VR and haven't used any of those features, but there are so many crammed in that this phone would be an excellent choice if you needed to. Occasionally for some reason i manage to accidentally switch on speakerphone and i'm not sure why but i doubt it's a real bug. 100% recommended.

This is an absolutely horrible phone, a death waiting to happen! the designers must be 20-something kids, because any adult who uses a phone in the real world would never want one that is so distracting and so difficult to use. The worst feature of this entire phone is the phone app itself. For instance, I almost just crashed because I had an incoming call but nowhere on the phone could I see anything that said answer, whereas my previous iPhone would have had a nice clear incoming message with a big button that said answer. When you do take a call, for any number of reasons you may end up with a tiny little icon in the upper-left corner that let you return to the call. Tough to hit, especially if you have adult size hands, and especially if you are driving at the time. They pack it full of features, but don't make the most common items the easiest to use. Then they add in a bunch of Auto features, but I can't tell you the number of times I type something and it filled in a word that was wrong and I had to go and delete but it had typed. Then there is the Bluetooth - for whatever reason it does not play well with my car, and I frequently answer a call only to find neither can hear each other until I take it off Bluetooth.Then there are times when it's connected to the Bluetooth of the car, but I do something such as play a voicemail in the voicemail does not play through the car even though they are supposed to be connected.",84.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 Verizon 64GB Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Factory-Unlocked-Black/dp/B07JVDQP47,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jEXWFEGOL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07JVDQP47,63,464.0,799.99

There is however a downside with any phone that uses an eSim (yes one of the two sims on Pixel 4 is an eSim while the other is a physical sim), is that if your phone gets damaged, you will not have a physical sim to use in your spare phone and you must then get a physical sim activated by your provider...which means when your damaged eSim phone has been repaired, you will then have to download the eSim back onto your eSim phone (which I think will mean yet another visit to your provider) This is of course not a problem if you don't have a habit of breaking your phones, like I do.",13.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

21699,B07K3X5JTP,Max Moreira,4,6-Jul-19,True,You buy this for the camera.,"The notch is ugly but you know this before you buy it. The phone feels very nice and premium. The software is weirdly unstable, I thought being stock Android would be great but no, I think it's because of the 4GB of RAM this thing has, apps keeps crashing and reloading everytime you reopen them. I am posting this on July 6th so at this moment Android Q is only available in beta. I did give it a try and it's way more stable, battery life is much better in Android Q, so I do think the phone will be great when the official version is released. But this is a Pixel, you buy this for the camera and you're not wrong. I have compared it with iPhone Xs and it's just on another level, I have even compared it with Huawei P30 Pro and Huawei only have much better zoom, Pixel is just superior with the quality of the photos. In the audio department, it sounds great, I've seen better like iPhone Xs and Asus ROG phone but it has front facing speakers with excellent quality and volume. In the screen department, this generation is like 600% better than the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 were just terrible, this one is a very nice AMOLED display, colors are good and accurate, viewing angles are also top. In the battery life, well... It's not good to be honest. I have found myself charging this thing twice a day with normal use. 3 times even with heavy use.. if you're taking a lot of photos it will just eat your battery. For example, I recorded 8 minutes of the 4th of July fireworks in NYC, it consumed 15-20% of the battery. That's just crazy. But all this little issues has been resolved with the Android Q, even it being a beta is just much more stable than the current official Android 9. If you want this Pixel, go for it. It's a great phone.

The phone works well in every way. I did have difficulty activating initially, but I can't blame the phone. The phone is an LTE phone, so it supports both GSM and CDMA networks. And ALL Pixel 2 phones are unlocked. But it came in a box that had ""CDMA"" printed in large letters, which confused me. And it had a Verizon SIM card already in its SIM slot. I thought that I could just bring it to a Sprint store and let them activate this phone. The phone number that I wished to use was already with Sprint (CDMA). But that was a complete fiasco that lasted three hours. At that point, I came very close to returning the phone. But I picked up a Consumer Cellular SIM card (GSM) from Target. Over the phone, Consumer Cellular ported the phone number from Sprint in a matter of seconds, activated the SIM card, and helped me manually enter the special strings needed to enable Internet over their data connection.

17698,B0799ZMY6D,S. Osterloh,4,6-Feb-19,True,"Had to replace my Samsung Galaxy S8+ - Enter Pixel 2xl - What I like, and what I miss.","I had to replace my Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus (audio problems, cracked back, etc.) and opted for the refurbished Pixel 2XL. There's a lot to like, not the least of which is value for the money given that it is refurbished. It's got a good sleek feel, is not loaded with bloatware, and of course, gets all the latest updates pronto. In the middle ground, the camera is highly touted and is good, but I can't say it's better than what I had with the Galaxy 8+. Here's what I miss, however: No removable SD card. No wireless charging. And worst of all, no DEX (ability to use your phone as a computer with keyboard, mouse and monitor.) I have to admit, I loved my Galaxy using DEX. I have tried to get similar mirroring with the Pixel using Sentio Desktop, Displaylink and a Displaylink adapter. You have to write in a bunch of code lines to get it functional at all, and in the end, I have just given up on it (at least for now.) The display was not accurate and there were other notable limitations. Let's just say, it wasn't even close to DEX. With all of that said, it's a good phone for the money, and having bought numerous refurbished items, I can say, I've never really noticed a difference between new and refurbished.

17630,B0799ZMY6D,Ryan Jacobs,4,6-Feb-19,True,I think just because its a Pixel - Love it!,"Before buying it, I was in a Spiral because I never knew if it would be compatible in South Africa. I took the leap and clicked the purchase button. When I got it a week later, I was greeted with mixed feelings. The Box was not the original, nor were the charging cable and adapter. I immediately purchased a replacement cable and charging block to sort out that issue. Still no quick charge though, which is a bit of a bummer, but I guess I will figure my way around that. Coming from my Mate 10 Pro which has outstanding battery life and fast charge My major concern was the condition of the device, battery life and the fear that the Screen is as bad as reviews I have read and watched. I must say upon initial inspection, I did notice minor chips and scratches, a bit of a damper on my purchase because some reviews claim receiving spotless units. Due to the price I paid, I accepted it, and understand that it is a refurbished unit and overlooked the scratches and chips. At this price you cannot expect a brand new device. With that said, its the only thing that has really been an issue for me. Furthermore, the Pixel 2 XL is everything that I expected it to be. The screen is not as punchy and bright as the Mate 10 or my previous Note 8, it is not bad either. The battery is outstanding, the charging times are just ""NORMAL"" but the snappy software,regular software updates, amazing camera, stereo speaker sound quality, software features and everything that comes with the PIXEL makes me feel great about my purchase.

Like the iPhone, the screen is navigated through a series of swipes, left-swipe to go back, up-swipe to return to home screen, tap to hold for options. The phone tries to intuit what a swipe means and very rarely gets this correct. If you're reading an article and want to left-swipe to go back and re-read something, most of the time, you'll close either the page or the program. Using this phone requires one to to learn what these swipes mean. It is very aggravating. The only buttons it has are the off button and the up/down volume button, which are right next to one another. So, half the time you want to turn the volume up, you shut down your phone. It is such a badly designed phone, that the chief designer for this should be kicked out of technology forever. ... It wants to have clean ergonomic lines like the iPhone, so it has only a single USB-C port at the bottom. So, get used to your clean, ergonomic phone to have a dangling scrotum of attachments and adapters constantly plugged into the base. There is no headphone jack. ... So, there is the mystery of why this terrible thing exists. It only appeals to people who like iPhones. But people who like iPhones aren't going to buy this. They're going to buy iPhones.

But I recently started looking for a smaller, faster and newer alternative. I love Google phones so pixel was the obvious choice. I found a used pixel 1st Gen 32gb silver for $250 that looked clean in the pictures so I went for it (I bought from TheGizmoTrader btw one of the only 3rd party sellers that provides pictures of their used devices). I'm so happy with the purchase the device was very clean and almost scratch free just as the photos indicated. I'll start by saying this is a very nice phone. The 4 gb of RAM makes a huge difference in speed and overall performance, precessor is very fast, and the camera takes beautiful pictures. Pixel launcher is also a huge step up from the basic Google now launcher. In regards to aesthetics the phone is beautiful, lightweight, and sleek in my opinion, although it is fairly slippery in the hand. An important side note, please be aware that if you are buying a used version of the pixel there is a chance it is the Verizon version which has the oem bootloader locked. This will prevent you from being able to root the phone(although there might be a workaround for this that I'm not aware of).

21587,B07JVDQP47,Notorious RED,3,4-Jun-19,False,"Deliberately crippled, good phone otherwise","I have no complaints about the features and how they work. Everything works as expected. The Pixel 3 is quick, and it's cameras are really impressive. But then Google crippled the phone to sell its own accessories. If you buy any Qi charger but Google's, it will only slow charge and not use the 7.5W or 10W fast charging feature. So if you want fast wireless charging, the $15 Qi chargers on Amazon will charge slow, while the $80 Pixel one will do the full 10W. It also crippled screen mirroring through USB C Thunderbolt cables to sell Chromecasts. And that is a crap solution, because not everything that plays video will ""Cast"". If I have presentations to give on a big monitor, that is probably not going to happen. Those two things make this phone much less useful as a travel and business companion than an S9 or S10. I can get around the first by using cable charging when I need to charge fast. I just won't be able to do the second like I used to when I had an S5. Chromecast is just not the same as plugging in an HDMI cable. If this phone were not on sale (I got the Verizon locked version for $499) I would have returned it. For a couple hundred dollars, I can accept slow wireless charging, and having to bring my tablet for presentations and to watch my online services at the hotel. Full price?

That said, it's not without a notable flaw that keeps it from five stars. It apparently didn't occur to anyone at Google that they might have loyal customers who have more than one of their devices. In my case, a Google Home. Pre-home I could say ""Ok, google: remind me at the grocery to buy milk"" and the next time I was at a grocery store--any grocery store--I would get a reminder. Awesome. Now the Home interferes. My phone will respond ""answering on another device"" and the Home will tell me it can't do that yet. Thanks, Google. I contacted Google and they offered no solution other than manually pausing the mic on the Home when I want to give a command to my phone alone. No, thanks. The whole point of all this technology is that it's hands-free. Google could easily fix this by allowing customizable wake words. My 2014 Droid Turbo allowed this! Enormously disappointing. I'm going to try to fix it by putting the Home on an auxiliary Google account. This will have its own drawbacks, but since the store-based shopping lists are something I use extensively I think it'll be worth it for me. Also I have a family Play Music account so I can add the auxiliary account as one of the ""family members"" and still have full music access. The pros, however, are too numerous to list. I came to the Pixel by way of the Nexus 5x. I loved the 5x, but it has significant limitations. All worth it to get a pure Google phone with a fingerprint reader. The camera responsiveness and quality are great (and much improved). The fingerprint reader is just as snappy. The size is just a hair smaller, to its benefit. The increased RAM (2gb to 4gb) is terrific and much needed.

26859,B07YMNLXL3,KC,2,4-Dec-19,False,Snapped along the antenna lines on the sides within 3 days,"I bought this phone to replace my Pixel 3 XL, because its rear camera died 5 days after the warranty ended. (sigh) Initial impressions were poor. The lack of a fingerprint reader sucks, no matter how fast the face scanning is. I could unlock my Pixel 3 with an index finger before it even left my pocket, which is now impossible. It also doesn't always wake up and scan, meaning you have to tap the screen until it scans. The radar gimmick is, well, a gimmick. The only thing it seems to be useful for is swapping between songs, but it's very VERY unreliable even for this. It doesn't consistently detect swipes, so you end up waving your hand at your phone frantically with nothing happening. It's also supposed to wake up the screen when you reach for it. Again, the success rate of this seems to be pretty low, meaning you again have to tap the screen to wake it up. Wouldn't have been a problem with a fingerprint reader. I was ready to get over these deficiencies after the first couple of days, but then the worst thing happened. There are four antenna lines that run horizontally on the sides of the phone, under black paint. They're positioned above the power button and the SIM card tray at the top, with two more at the bottom somewhere. Somehow the entire phone bent inwards and snapped at this point, leaving two cracks on either side and the screen bent slightly inwards. I realize this is likely my fault, and I probably leaned on my pocket or something at some point. But I am 100% sure I did not put an excessive amount of pressure on the phone in the first few days. I've used the Pixel 3XL in the same pockets for the past year, and the Pixel 2 before that. The thing just snapped like nothing. There's no reinforcement in the sides whatsoever. This is a $1000 phone. Why does it feel like a cheap iPhone knockoff? I can't stand iOS, and Samsung are slow on updates.

Critics knocked this phone, but I gotta tell ya. It's fantastic. Pros: * The Vanilla Android Experience. It's fantastic. Much better than Samsungs or LGs UI. * Camera - I don't care what DXO Mark says. This and the Iphone 11 have the best cameras. I was using the Note 10+ before this and it doesn't even come close. If you have kids that move around. This is the camera to get. Hands down. * Face Unlock - Never thought I'd appreciate it so much. Fast, accurate. Fantastic * Screen - Fantastic. Smooth. I turned the 90Hz off and didn't notice a difference. It's great. * Sound Quality - As good as the best out there. Cons - * Battery life is Good. Not terrible. But at these prices you expect Google to keep up with phones like the Note 10 * They took away the finger print scanner, which is fine, but with that they also took away the ""Menu Down"" feature you could use w/ the finger print scanner. That....I miss. * I would have wanted a bigger screen for this price, bu that's me being picky. * Price - Only buy this phone on sale. Not woth $900 or 1K . I bought it on Black Friday. I went from the Pixel 2XL to the Note 10+. I wasn't happy with the Note 10+. Battery life was fantastic but the pictures were just terrible. I gotta tell you....this is the phone.

I pre-ordered mine (128 GB White) for essentially the Black Friday cost ($799 for the phone + $100 amazon gift card = $699). You already know that the camera is outstanding. The battery is fine. Maybe if you can kill the battery in 12 hours, you should put your phone down once in a while and enjoy real life. Plus, with wireless charging, is it really so hard to top off the battery during the day? The only time I have every been surprised with battery drain was when I was in a region with poor cell service, but that's not the phone's fault. Face unlock is super fast. I really don't miss fingerprint unlock, assuming Chase gets it together and adds face unlock support. People are crying that face unlock works while you are sleeping and that is ""sooooo insecure""... um do your fingerprints disappear while you sleep or close your eyes?

17264,B0787V183F,Marisela Castro,5,31-Oct-19,True,"Reliable, Sleek, with Great Battery Life!","I used to have the original Google Pixel 32 GB. I decided to make the switch a little over a year ago from Apple because to be honest, I was done giving Apple my coins especially because with each new phone, older generations of the iPhone kept slowing down and messing up. I also have most of my files and info on Gmail and Google Drive both for work and personal so the switch was much needed! The Google Pixel was great but it was a little slow and the battery life has diminished significantly within a year of use so I decided to switch to Google Pixel 2. I purchased a refurbished Google Pixel 2, white, with 64 GB. I was seriously SHOCKED when I saw the quality of the phone upon opening the box. I had to do a double take and check to make sure they hadn't charged me full price for a brand new Google Pixel 2 because it looks impeccable. My older phone had little bumps around the edges which is expected for any refurbished phone but behold, this phone has absolutely no dents or scratches. The phone is sleek and easy to hold. Since most of my files are on Google Drive, I was able to switch everything over easily. I easily moved the SIM card from my old phone to the new one effortlessly. I have Cricket Wireless and it was able to connect just fine. I didn't lose any files in the process of switching over which is a major plus because I can remember the countless times I lost files with iPhone. Another bonus that was unexpected was that the phone already came with a glass screen protector! That was a great surprise. Overall the phone so far is working amazingly. It's a smooth design so it just sits well in your hand. I was about to get the Google Pixel 2 XL but since I have small hands I wanted to opt out for the regular size and boy was it worth it. I bought this phone from Tech Wholesale and they were amazing with delivery as well. Since I live in a gated apartment they didn't even leave the phone over the gate, they left a notice letting me know that I could pick it up at a local Walgreens which was super easy. If you're looking to update your phone because you're just tired of it slowing down on you or tired of constantly having to charge your phone, I highly recommend purchasing this one from Tech Wholesale. Google Pixel thus far has not let me down and I plan on being a loyal customer (until proven otherwise haha).

I wouldn't consider myself a big photographer but the camera and images are so good and so easy to take I'm constantly taking pictures now. Unlimited photo back up through Google is amazing as well. - the bigger screen (also see cons). I came from an S7 and was nervous this phone would be unweildy. And while it's big enough that it's not always perfect to use with one hand I can do most things with one hand. But I don't mind having to use the other hand for the increased screen real estate. - battery life is good and is lasting me through the day - absolutely no bloatware! - gestures on Android 9 are fluid and snappy - data transfer from my old phone was done in less than 10 minutes. - front facing speakers, not the best quality but the directionality is nice. Cons: - slightly too big to get to every inch of the screen with one hand (I have small hands) - lots of notifications from Google photos - screen brightness leaves just a bit to be desired, always usable but could be brighter in direct light - moving the volume rocker to the left side of the phone would be better. It's slightly small and too close to the power button",1.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Black-Renewed/dp/B079C1K282,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CDE9pG4hL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B079C1K282,254,189.96,210.67

Google assistant integration is great and convenient. Dual speakers are a joy to use, screen size and usable area are greatly improved while being quite handy. Still just a little smaller than iPhone 8 plus. Great, clear pictures with portrait mode as well. And yes there are screen issues as mentioned on the news and social media. However the only issue I notice is the light blue tinting at certain angles. Which my other AMOLED or OLED screen devices also had but in different tint color and not so easily noticed angles. On the other hand I like that it is perfectly viewable with polarized sunglasses under any light.

10571,B01M0PADR4,Doc Martin,5,31-Oct-16,False,Gives Apple a run for the money....this is close to being an I-Killer phone.,"I've owned android based phones since google started rolling them out. I was an early adopter for the Nexus 6 and loved it. I use my tech a lot and when I had the chance to get a Pixel XL through Project Fi, I ordered one. I am very pleased. This phone is light, quick, and responsive. The Google Assistant is a thing of beauty and a sign that all the billions of dollars Google has invested in machine intelligence is paying off for them. Metal case, fingerprint sensor, gorilla glass screen - all pretty much par for the course. The phone is NOT IP68 certified but it does have it's IP53 certification. I've seen some brave - or wealthy - souls who have soaked their XL in a bowl of water for a half hour or so. I am not willing to put mine to the test. Splash, rain, and dust resistant is fine for me. I got a sprigen case and if I am worried about it, I guess I could get an Otterbox or something like that. The fingerprint sensor is responsive and easy to program. The rear camera sports 12.3 megapixels and the front weighs in at 8. Frankly, I pretty much use the camera for apps like Plickers and casual snapshots of the pets at home - this camera is plenty good for these needs. I have very nice digital pocket and SLR cameras for fine photography. Google states they have image stabilization and I guess it's worked well enough for the casual work I've done with the phone. The max aperture setting is f 2.0. The battery is the standard internal battery and it has been a trooper since I got the phone Friday. IMy days start at 0400 and according to the phone, I still have some 15 hours left - and I took it off the cradle around 0420. And I have been working the phone today, folks. There have been a lot of criticisms about the hardwired battery, but an 'Ifixit' video on the Pixel XL teardown indicated that a replacement - if needed - shouldn't be an ordeal. I really like the type C connector and the charging time is insanely short. The Pixel XL does NOT have Qi charging. This was something I questioned but it seems that Qi is something that is falling out of vogue. Again, the phone charges in no time at all, so this isn't a huge deal for me - certainly not a deal breaker. Let's talk about the other power that counts - what's driving the phone. The processor is a quad core snapdragon 821 cpu. Combined with an Adreno GPU and 4 MB of RAM, this puppy runs nougat like a dream. The video is nice and sharp. The Google Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440, The glass is Corning Gorilla glass. I get a tempered glass screen protector for my phones because I am paranoid and I have seen the $6.00 protector 'take one' for the phone. What does this mean in plain English? My youtube videos and movies look great. Storage. Google does not like the idea of SD cards and they didn't choose to change their habits with this phone. I have the 32GB phone and frankly, I am OK with this. I work in the cloud a lot - I have WIfi access pretty much everywhere I go, and I have a handful of apps that I use - I don't need a lot of memory....and I have been using this phone for everything from grading to working on slide shows, lesson plans, student handouts, and working with my Google Classroom - so I am putting this through it's paces. Would more storage be a good thing? I guess - but I have everything I need and am nowhere NEAR capacity. Sound? Good thing I have some nice headphones. The Pixel XL does drop the ball with a single speaker. It's pretty robust, but if you want stereo, I hope you have something to plug into your speaker jack. The USB C interface is promising - it allows for more than just power. There are some promising USB C speaker docks that I have my eye on. Now to Google Assistant. There are two types of people - those who love Google's integration with it's suite of apps and assistive technologies and those who see it as 'big brother' snooping. I fall into the former category. I was a google fan since there was a Google and I've been on the ground floor for most of their offerings. As a teacher, I am a huge fan of their apps. As a busy guy I love being able to ask my phone to help me keep my life organized. I liked Google now and find the new Assistant to be insanely useful. I understand there are a lot of options in Nougat that allow you to modify the access you want to give Google. My carrier is Project Fi (told you I was a google geek) and it's working fine. I understand Verizon is offering this phone as well. Mine came straight from the Google Play Store via Project Fi and is pretty much vanilla Android - which makes me happy. This phone is a premium device and you pay for it. While some criticize that Google could have done better for their first true 'brand' phone, I am very pleased with the performance of my XL. I recommend it highly",52.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

17768,B079C1K282,Fremen,2,31-Aug-18,False,Expensive piece of disappointment,"Let me preface this by saying I have had my share of smart phones. Starting with the very first Android phone the Tmobile G1, and countless others since then including the Samsung cheapo phones they sell at walmart and the Samsung top of their line phones like the S5 etc. and then the LG G4, G5 and LG V10. and even had an Iphone 7 plus for a while...then I settled on this Pixel 2 XL. First of all, the camera is pretty good. It takes great pics. However LG G5 etc was smarter in including a wide angle lens for selfies and even one for regular shots. I was always able to get amazing shots of the entire group, while the pixel2 has no wide angle capabilities and I'm usually having to step far away to get everyone in the shot. But that's the good thing about this phone. The bad thing. First of all, the speakerphone volume is a joke. I don't know what is the problem with this phone, but there is no consistency to it. Either the person on the other hand is barely audible or they're too loud. This is ridiculous. It shouldn't matter what the source signal volume is, you should be able to boost that to the max that the speakers on this phone can handle. I know it can be much louder because sounds like the chime when you hit voice to text in fb messenger is insanely loud to the point of hurting my ears! So its not a hardware limitation its a software issue. another issue with this phone is probably due more to Android than the phone itself. The sharing mechanisms for photos is a joke. Its horrible. Let me download a photo off the web or from fb. Then if I want to share it or send it to someone..good luck! Every app seems to have its own idea of where to grab photos from. Sometimes the downloads folder is not showing what I just downloaded..why is that? where are they? where did they go? I've resorted to taking screenshots of everything because that's the only way to share the image...even though its there on my storage taking up space....the ridiculous sharing doesn't show whats really there. Is this a performance issue? maybe they're caching things? Iphone was kind of annoying as well because when you modified an image and wanted to share it, it wouldn't let you find the image by modified date, but instead only by the date the picture was taken. so you have to scroll all the way down to where the picture was taken even though you JUST modified it. Well, android is even worse...it doesn't even show the image at all...maybe 2 hours later..it might pop up. This makes me think that Google photos is the problem. The old gallery app would just show the photos on your phone..but I think google photos is doing some syncing and it doesn't work right away. Maybe nothing notifies it that you download a new picture... but whatever the reason its just really poor programming on google's part. Here's another issue..and this is the worst one yet. Since updating to Android pie (9) the OS can be extremely laggy. There are times when it freezes up on me...I can't stand this lag. It feels like I'm using a phone from 10 years ago. there's no excuse to be so laggy...even if I'm on wifi with fast internet, its still laggy. I found others complaining about the same problem on twitter...but no fixes for it ? Oh, one last thing about the sharing feature on android phones. For some reason when you want to share something, it keeps popping up with contacts from various applications...people I've never shared with before. how stupid is that? very stupid. You can easily accidentally share a private photo with random contacts from twitter. That's really stupid....maybe google thinks your private photos should be shared with everyone? i can't find a way to change this or edit what contacts it shows. Everyone says Android is better than Iphone because you can customize it. What are they talking about?? I can't even customize the people it wants to share things with. I would love to stop it from offering to share with random contacts period..but that's not possible either. It may be possible if I root the phone..but that is stupid if that's what you have to do.",4.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Black-Renewed/dp/B079C1K282,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CDE9pG4hL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B079C1K282,254,189.96,210.67

26805,B07YMNLXL3,JoHn,4,30-Oct-19,False,Pixel 4 XL vs Samsung Note 10?,"So I was lucky enough to use both phones for a while and here are my thoughts : Display: The thing you use the most really on any phone now is the screen, the note 10 has an amazing screen & I never expected any phone to have better screen to look at. Well, the Google Pixel did just that! I dunno if it's the cleaner software or what, but the Pixel's screen does feel a little nicer. Camera: While the Pixel should have been the clear winner here, it really isn't! Yes, the front selfie camera, at night or indoor is definitely better, but honestly it feels worse than last year's Pixel 3 for some reason. The selfies feel a little fake, and the camera angles are weird. The back camera however isn't much better than the Note, in fact I find myself missing the wide angle camera that I had on my Note, a lot! On a side note, my wife's iPhone 11 pro back camera also feels a little better than the Pixel's, which is also unexpected Half star off really, not for a bad camera, but for the disappointment, it's just not as good as expected. Software: No need to bother comparing here, the Google software is much better, cleaner, smoother & more productive than that of Samsung, hands down the Pixel OS wins here. Battery: Not that much of a difference, the Note 10 does tend to last longer. Both aren't that great though but the Note will give you, may be, a couple more extra hours, which is appreciated really! Design: The Note 10 is beautiful! Very slick, all screen display, nice curvy sides, while the pixel does look good overall, specially the back, but the front design is ugly, and I don't care if they have a radar on the front, it really doesn't seem to be that much more functional and I would rather have the fingerprint scanner with an all edge to edge display, thinner phone, than the secure face ID with a big top hinge. Another half star off for a lazy design. The face ID itself is worth mentioning, it's surprisingly accurate and fast, but so many apps don't support it yet and having to enter passwords for banks & stuff seems like something that we had left behind, but with the lack of fingerprint and the lack of face id support on so many Android app, there really are no other options, try not to forget those passwords, you'll be in trouble! Overall, I think I'll be keeping my Pixel for a little while longer but I can't say I'm fully happy with it really.",58.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

26877,B07YMNLXL3,tyler,4,30-Oct-19,True,Battery isn't bad.,"I'm only writing this because the negative are pathetic and not even close to realistic in my experience in the first week of owning the phone. The battery is fine. I am coming from a pixel 2 and the battery lasts longer than that phone easily. From full charge in the morning, to browsing the internet, listening to music via bluetooth headphones, checking email, etc etc periodically through the day, I usually end up with about 40-50% battery left easily. To say its done within a couple of hours, that person must have max screen brightness and streaming 4k videos. The screen is incredible, and camera flawless. I am however taking off a star due to not caring for the round edges on the screen and am still having a hard time adjusting to face unlock over fingerprint. Everything else about the phone is nothing short of extremely well executed. One more point, how on earth is face unlock any less secure than a fingerprint scanner? Both can only be opened by the person using the phone. And someone could just as easily put your finger on a scanner as moving it over your face if you're incapacitated. So confused by that one, but that guy got on here to troll as he doesnt even have a verified purchase.

26857,B07YMNLXL3,Bernie Bernbaum,5,30-Oct-19,False,Great Phone,"I'm an iPhone user and bought the Pixel 4 for it's camera. I do a travel blog and I've been dragging a Nikon D7500 camera with an 18-300mm lens with me. The Pixel will allow me to put the ""camera"" in my pocket when I'm not using it. I've been testing the camera and It's not the same as the Nikon - it's better in low light but has some weaknesses in regular light. The zoom is good and bad. It will zoom well and give me a sufficiently sharp image - but the resolution (number of pixels) is not that large. If I crop the picture there's not many pixels left. In regular light, I find the color and contrast a bit ""sharp"" which makes the picture look a bit processed. I'm working on improving that with the adjustments I can do on the camera. The Pixel does provide RAW images but they don't give me as much adjustment range as the RAW images from my Nikon. Some people complain about the lack of a wide angle camera but I can always do a panorama. The battery should have been bigger so I'll get a battery case for it to make sure I have sufficient charge. It just makes the phone a bit thicker which I don't object to. Otherwise, I find that Android provides pretty much the same features and functionality as my iPhone but does them differently so there's a learning curve for me. Not really hard but it'll take time for me to be comfortable with it. Computational photography is obviously the future of photography and I expect that Google will make improvements to the camera over time. But for my use, I think the Pixel 4 will release me from having to lug around a big camera and lens. I bought the 128GB version to make sure I have enough memory for pictures, especially since I use the RAW function. I'll dump the pictures to my computer each night. I shoot more than four thousand pictures on a normal trip so dumping them off the phone each night is necessary. Overall, I'm pleased with the phone.

I just can't get over the negatives and actually am returning it and going back to my old phone. I watched the rumors on this phone for nearly a year with anticipation and joy. Android 10 is great, and so is the pure Android experience. The camera software is excellent, too, but the lack of ultra-wide angle camera hardware and mediocre battery ended up being bigger drawbacks than I could tolerate in the end. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but after having an ultra-wide camera on my last phone, I have learned really can't go back. I tried. I used to have the Nexus 5 years ago, which was probably one of my favorite, most reliable phones of all time. But this phone just doesn't wow enough to justify the price, when others out there are sadly beating them at the hardware game.

That was a MISTAKE and let me tell you why. My refurbished phone was working fine since I got it around last February till two weeks ago. Pixel 2 XL is supposed to be IP rated and can be used under water and before two weeks ago I never tried that till one day I decided to give it a shot and took some pictures in the pool, I was very careful not to get more than a feet under water. After getting out of the pool things started to get crazy with my phone. Whenever I plug it to the charger or my car sound system (using the USB converter) the phone shuts down!! I contacted the seller and their reply was basically that warranty period has passed and we cannot help you! Please contact Google! I contacted Google and they were more helpful but at the end they said the phone was not sold via Google and they cannot cover warranty. I contacted the seller again with Google's reply. This time they actually NEVER replied back!!! Today, somehow, my phone is not shutting down when connected to the charger but still won't connect to audio converter. If the refurbished phone shouldn't be used under water, they should've mentioned that on their ad!! Unacceptable dishonesty and VERY unprofessional seller.

10270,B01M01YX15,Leavened,3,30-Apr-19,True,Google Pixel 2016 Has a Known Microphone Issue - Buyer Beware,"I purchased a used Google Pixel (2016 model) in March 2019 after damaging my old phone and hoping to tide myself over until I paid all the installments on the old phone. I'd heard good things about the Pixel and found a used model for a good price here on Amazon. I got the phone on time and in one piece, with an included after market charger as promised. The phone's condition was described accurately - a few minor scratches on the case but no screen cracks and no apparent problems. However, after a few days of use the problems started to appear. The first time I tried to make a phone call on the phone, I discovered there was a serious problem. The phone's microphone was not working during phone calls or at any time. When this bug presented itself, it completely crashed the ""Phone"" app and I could not even hear the person on the other end of the line. After some research, I found out that this was a known problem with 2016 Google Pixels. There are some known issues where the phone will sometimes think you have a bluetooth headset paired to it when you really don't and just in general hardware and software issues with the microphone. You can find these issue by simply Googling ""2016 Pixel Microphone."" Phone calls worked just fine so long as I had a bluetooth headset paired, but if I wanted to talk directly on the phone it would only work if I restarted the phone and kept bluetooth disabled and even then it only worked about 1 out of 3 times. Amazon asked for a few specific features to be reviewed. The fingerprint reader worked perfectly. It picked up my index finger without issue. No issues with this feature. The battery life was very poor, even for a used phone. I could only get through about 8-9 hours away from a charger before the phone would die. It would also unexpectedly shut off with 10-15% charge remaining. Though, I should say it was unexpected when the phone didn't die until it got down below 5% because it almost always shut down somewhere between 10 and 20% charge remaining. Even with battery saver mode permanently enabled, the phone could barely get through a work day. Battery life is going to be hit or miss with a used device so I give it some leeway, but this Pixel's battery was significantly worse than any smartphone I've ever had even after years of use. Overall, the phone was a decent value for the money.

After six hours, the phone ""woke"" by itself. I then turned it off and on again. Since that episode, the flashlight, airplane mode, and adaptive brightness settings have activated frequently at will, without my selecting them. I deselect them, and they reactivate. The volume setting does not stay at the level I select, icons for apps I install appear, disappear, and then reappear. The connection to my WiFi system constantly turns off by itself. Worst of all, the phone and contact apps fail repeatedly. More often than not, when I place a call, the phone indicates that the call is being put though, but no connection is made. When I turn off or restart the phone, the phone occasionally returns to life for one call, then the phone app fails again. I receive constant messages such as ""Phone app isn't responding,"" ""UI system isn't responding,"" and ""Process system isn't responding."" I laid out all this in detail to the seller via Amazon, and asked where to return the phone for a refund. Instead of instructions on how and where to return it, I received the nonsensical reply: ""We do apologize for the issue, can you please explain what is going on with the unit to further assist you?""

Then they release the pricing - same ballpark as the iphone. OK sure it's a google phone, probably has the same quality as the iphone right? No, wrong. It feels cheap compared to an iphone, it looks cheap compared to an iphone. The ridiculous uncentered screen is dim compared to an iphone. Honestly this phone looks like a 2017 model year phone, not 2019. But then again it's made by HTC which should tell you everything you need to know right there. The spec is a joke, 64gb storage, no free google photo uploads - they are trying to be apple without providing the excellent hardware. Android 10 is great but STILL it has stuttering scrolling even with a 90hz screen. Anyone who says different is kidding themselves, IOS scrolls liquid smooth without resorting to a 90hz refresh rate. The whole radar chip gesture navigation is a total gimmick waste of hardware and resources and screen real estate. No one is going to use it in its current iteration. Android 10 telephony support is inferior to IOS - you can make whatsapp calls from favorites in IOS dialer - not an option in Android 10.

10600,B01M0PADR4,L. M Young,3,3-Dec-16,False,Never So Disappointed in My Life,"Really, really disappointed in this phone. First the good things: very thin, very light. Screen nice and sharp. Sound is good. Sound on call is almost too loud. Camera is okay. Liked the 360 feature, was looking forward to playing with it. As far as I'm concerned, the battery isn't all that good. Others rave about it. I keep my screen brightness down and it still seems like it drains too quickly. However, it doesn't do the simple stuff that my two-year-old Droid Turbo did. I have Android Pay, which requires you to put a lock screen on the phone. With the Droid Turbo using the Moto Voice app, which allows you to set a trigger phrase, I could be lying in bed and ask the phone (across the room) about the weather, or when a store opens, or to call my husband, and it would respond because the trigger phrase acted as a security screen. You can't do this with the Pixel. Once the lock screen engages, you can't ask it to do anything by voice until you have unlocked the screen manually. What the heck use is that? Even worse, this brand new spiffy piece of technology with the great ratings does NOT support USB to Go. On the Turbo I used to be able to plug a USB stick with a micro plug in it and I could transfer files or play whatever files were on the USB stick. Can you do this with the Pixel? Nope. I thought I had to activate something or I was using the wrong type of file manager to access my files, so contacted Google support today about it and they told me you can't use a USB stick with it. I complained to the tech I spoke with and he told me to send feedback to the developers and maybe they would offer the feature in future upgrades. Are you KIDDING me??? This is two-year-old (at least) technology and should already be on the phone!!! When you do a phone upgrade you expect it to be better than the old phone. This one is retrograde. It's like a dumb blonde, very pretty, with a nice seductive voice.

This phone, Google Pixel 3, had rave reviews. I should have Googled ""Pixel 3 problems"" before I purchased. The first phone I received had a flakey microphone, I could only talk to people on speaker phone. Returning the phone was painless, Amazon sent another out promptly. Driving to a UPS store sucks as does packing it up, oh well. Every call I've had with this second phone is terrible, terrible reception, some calls dropped, constantly having to repeat myself. I researched and found both the microphone and poor call quality is an issue with this phone.

That being said, this phone perfectly exemplifies what Android is supposed to be. Design: I miss the headphone jack. i use corded headphones regularly. That being said, I rarely use the headphone jack and charge the phone at the same time so using the USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter hasn't been an issue. An added plus of using the adapter is I no longer have to deal with certain headphone plugs not fitting due to my case not providing a big enough opening. I love that the speakers both face the front.I had adapted a way of holding other phones in a way so that my hand cupped the sound and directed it to my face. No longer needed. Otherwise, the phone is pretty standard as far as premium phones look. You'll likely use a case anyway this isn't really an issue. Performance: There is absolutely no lag in this phone. As soon as you touch a button or spot on the screen, its already where you need to be before the entire weight of your finger crashes down. You can snap photos one after the other and not face any dreaded processing hold screen. OK Google detection is much improved. Not sure if this is due to hardware or software, but I no longer have issues waking my phone up to tell it to create a reminder or something like that. Also, I haven't noticed it responding to others saying OK Google like my previous phone did, but I wasn't on Oreo yet so that could also be why. (but I can't rule out better microphone hardware that might be able to provide better signal to noise ratio) Finger print sensor is lightning fast. Haven't had too many issues with my fingerprint not reading although I did load the same finger twice to get better results. Battery life: With my previous Nexus 5x, if I used the phone (basic stuff like reading news, listening to music, and maybe watching a couple youtube videos/using the maps app) I could maybe make it half a day. With the Pixel 2 after a day of light use I still have 50% battery left. I could likely go 2 days of light use or 1 day of heavy (watching videos) use. Display: The display is absolutely beautiful. The new screen allows for individual pixels to be turned on or off which makes the blacks super dark as there's no backlight. I think this is also why the battery life is so awesome. As a plus, the time, date, temperature, and icons of notification types are able to be displayed on the phone at all times. This is awesome as it makes the phone a true nightstand clock replacement and you can even tell if you missed a text without touching your phone.

I have had it for 3 days now. It is very fast, all the usual bloat is removed (I always had to root my phones to get all of the unwanted apps off). The camera is fantastic. I work at a technology company where everyone compares their phones and I would say it is right up there with the iPhone 7. The phone build is very sturdy and well built. The fingerprint reader is instant. Pick up the phone and as soon as your finger glides past the reader it instantly unlocks. Couple of negatives that I knew about but still purchased the phone. I wish the phone has an SD slot for expanded memory. I also like batteries that may be replaced but that seems to be a thing of the past.

Was surprised how much longer it lasted. Initially the mic would cut out when I used my headset. Got the patch and it updated so that's fine. Android tends to send a lot of ads which gets a bit annoying. I love how you can turn the data and the wi fi off. I think that's great! You can also create your own hot spot which I haven't done yet but I was reading about it the other day. Ive had a few apps crash on me here and there but not something that happens that often. They're kinda pricey but the benefits that come with it outweigh any phone I've ever had. I've had Android phones in the past and always returned them since some of the features were wonky and archaic. The typical Android seemed so invasive compared to what I had before. I did the exchange program so I sent Verizon an old phone I had on hand and they $100 off of the price.

10024,B01LY3OB8D,Apple Cohen,5,29-May-17,True,Great phone!,"I was previously on a Windows Lumia 830. I thought migrating to Android and Google Pixel would be a massive step up - in terms of speed of the OS switching between apps (response lag) and in terms of the phone quality itself. It turns out that the Windows OS is superior to Android - way better in fact - but of course no one makes apps for Windows...and Google navigation is great amongst other apps of course. ANyway, the phone is fast, but not lightening fast in terms of switching between apps and opening apps. But it does not frustrate - it is fast enough. The camera is awesome. 5 stars there.The fingerprint scanner is also excellent. The Pixel does not come preloaded with all the junk they load on Samsung, which is great. The S8 may be an object of beauty, but I wanted a phone that does not slow down due to apps overload and software layering. The Pixel has a an excellent build quality. Yes the screen does not curve to the edges, but so what. The phone works well, the signal strength is good. Chrome loads fast and the browser loads pages fast. VOice clarity on the phone is superb. I still need my phone to be a phone, and it does a great job in that area. Would I buy it again? Yes. Note - this phone was shipped to South Africa. It works 100% perfectly on any network here. Loud and clear, and fast on LTE. Note to the shipper - the packing was dismal. The box had no bubblewrap or any cushioning inside it. Very poor packaging.

The refurb process apparently doesn't include any kind of battery testing. So if you think this is a good deal, add in a new battery to your budget before you decide.

16125,B076QKMQ81,metzgerf16,1,29-Aug-18,True,Falls Short of Flagship Phone Standards,"I've had my Google Pixel 2 XL since May 2018, so I feel that I have given it a fair amount of time for an evaluation. In short, it fails to meet expectations for a phone in this price range and category. Android Auto still crashes randomly and almost always crashes anytime the phone loses one tower for another. That is unacceptable. There is no excuse for a Google phone failing to run a core application from it's own company. This has been a problem with the Pixel 2 phones since they were released, and Google has yet to address it. The only way to restart Android Auto is to unplug the USB cord and plug it back in, which is not something one cares to do while driving in traffic. Another issue with this phone is the sometimes wonky screen interaction. The touchscreen calibration is off just enough to irritate you and cause extra tapping and website navigation. Example: you tap ""Like"" on a Facebook post, and instead of getting ""like"" the browser navigates away from your news feed to the individual post. You tap ""back"", the browser navigates back, you tap ""like"" again, and the browser navigates to the individual post again. I know this sounds petty, but its incredibly annoying when it happens over and over again. The screen is also inconsistent in how it registers touches/taps. If you attempt to tap a link or button near the bottom or edge of the screen, you will get inconsistent responses. This can be avoided by zooming or moving the content to the center of the screen, but you can't always do that with mobile pages. When you attempt to watch embedded videos in full screen mode the video will expand to full screen, and when you rotate the phone to view full screen video the phone will revert back to the embedded view and auto scroll to the top of the current web page. Again, not a huge deal, but it's not a bug you expect to encounter from a top level phone. The fingerprint reader is very inconsistent. Sometimes it just flat will not read my finger at all. It just defaults to ""not recognized"", and then you re-tap until it maxes out the failed attempts and demands a PIN entry. This easy enough to remedy when the only thing you're doing is looking at your phone, but it's a real problem when you're say, driving in LA and Android Auto glitches out. So you pick up your phone to change the USB mode, but now the fingerprint reader refuses to work. You double tap the screen to activate it, and it comes on. Then you swipe up with your thumb to enter your PIN, but the wonky screen does the half swipe for no reason so you have to swipe again. You enter your six digit PIN and open the screen, but then you have to turn your attention to driving and your screen times out. Rinse and repeat. Pros: The construction is high quality, and the fit, finish, and feel is on point. The camera is excellent. Battery life is great. It runs most apps very well. No bloatware. If it weren't for the issues mentioned above, the Pixel 2 XL would be an amazing phone.

You’ll see a number of reviews on here most likely from Samsung or Apple employees making vague and mostly false negative claims, but this really is Googles best effort so far. Battery life is great, easily makes it through an entire day plus of normal use. Camera is by far the best one on a mobile device. The display is beautiful. Design is fine. If you’ve own a Pixel phone before you know cutting edge design isn’t Google’s thing. Utilitarian is the order of the day. Android 10 works great.

The eyes open thing I guess could be an issue for a very, very small segment of the population but it’s not one for me.

26862,B07YMNLXL3,Matt B,4,28-Nov-19,False,Not great not terrible,"It's not the greatest of the Android flagships, but it's a good phone. I preordered the Pixel 4 XL and recently got my $100 Google Store credit, only for it to drop $200 for Black Friday, lol. I could have waited a bit longer but my Nexus 6P went into an infinite boot loop a couple months ago after nearly 4 years, so I waited and got the Pixel 4 XL. As others have said, it doesn't have the brightest screen, but I find it sufficient. The 90 Hz refresh isn't on all of the time by default unless you enable it in the developer options, which I did. I noticed that some reviewers (in general) were disappointed with the battery life, but it lasts me the whole day with my level of usage. I bought a pair of Seneo wireless chargers, 6' USB-C cables, and adapters--one for the home and another for the office, also bought the iOttie wireless charger for the car. Needless to say, I'm rarely below 80% battery. So far, the radar sensor is just a gimmick for actually directing the phone to perform actions since it's a bit sluggish even for skipping through songs or YouTube clips. But I do appreciate the fact that it lowers the volume of my alarm when my hand reaches over it when I go to snooze it! The camera quality is fantastic for photos, and it's decent for video, the stabilization is great. The face unlock is very fast, and yes, it can unlock with your eyes closed, and who knows when that'll be fixed. I have a twin brother, and his face is similar enough to mine (not identical) that even he could unlock my phone... Which brings me to my next point: I really dislike the fact that there is no fingerprint reader. It's annoying that most apps don't acknowledge facial recognition for app logins yet, so I have to resort to typing in the pin or password. All in all, if you love stock Android and are due for an upgrade like I was, then this is a very good phone!

Here's what bothers me about the phone: 1) cannot shoot 4k video at 60fps; 2) iPhone display looks better especially on video playback; 3) can't turn off the Google Assistant voice, so it always speaks an answer out loud when I would prefer it stay silent and merely display an answer (annoying out in public when you ask Google Assistant ""what's the forecast"" and it starts blathering for 20 seconds); 4) Google Assistant often gives incorrect answers to questions, or occasionally simply freezes when asked a question; 5) you can send a text message via Google Assistant by saying ""send a text message to Bill Smith"" ... but it won't reliably send an email; 6) Google Pixel tech support is easy to contact and friendly, but their Philippines-based employees are far from expert; 7) the speakers heavily distort sound at high volume, so as a practical matter you're limited to using 2/3 volume; 8) the battery charges slowly.",59.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0766TPHSH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dXcgzgqkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0766TPHSH,153,409.88,0.0
10140,B01LY3OB8D,R. A. Dumas,3,28-Nov-16,False,Not quite ready for prime time....,"Bought from Google but returned it and here's why: 1) Email: I use an exchange account and an office 365 account, and couldn't get both to sync with the native calendar and contacts, without installing three different programs. Other than phone calls, emails and calendaring are the most important functions to me and I needed it to be more seamless than what the Pixel allowed. Other Android phones (Sony, Samsung) offer an email app that has already worked out of the box. 2) Every now and then, the ringer would just stop. I'd have to reboot to get it to kick in again. 3) The kicker for me was when I used Google maps in the car and only got every other word of the command because the phone was crapping in and out. It seemed to me that Google maps should work well on a Google phone. But no. 4) Really poor battery life. 5) Phone call quality was subpar, and in some cases, there was a noticeable buzzing noise - almost like interference - during calls. This happened regularly. I wanted to love this phone and in fact thought the finger print reader on the back was great - one of the fastest I've used. Photos were also very good, although not so much better than other phones to make up for all of the Pixel's quirks. I suspect things will get better over time; and for people completely wed to the Google universe, who don't need exchange, etc., this may be a good choice for you.

15983,B0766TPHSH,Alex,5,28-Mar-18,False,Amazing phone (long review),"So I got the Panda version (white and black) and not from Amazon. I started off with the kinda blue Pixel 2 but the 5"" screen was driving me crazy. The 6"" screen is perfect. To first cover on complaints about the screen, I got mine a few weeks ago so it's after all the updates that Google did to fix the complaints that was happening with the screen. Personally, I think it's gorgeous and it's one of the many reasons I love this phone. DISPLAY - The 18:9 aspect ratio is amazing. Simple as that. It makes the screen so much bigger without having such a large phone. It's still a rather large phone but it's a lot easier to handle because it's not compensating for the large bezels. The rounded corners add such a nice flair. Everything just looks so clean. After the update, Google added multiple color choices including Natural (all colors are kind of darker but more true to life), Boosted (again, pretty dark but a little bit more vibrant) and Saturated (if you like Samsung displays, you'll love this) PERFORMANCE - This thing screams. A lot of phones are coming out with 6 gigs of RAM, 8 gigs of RAM. This destroys the competition with only 4 gigs of RAM. Even when I owned the smaller version, I haven't found a single app or game that chokes it up. It multitasks like a boss and with the latest version of Android every time it hits, you can't ask for much more UPDATES - I figured I would cover this now because of how I ended the last bit. This is a straight from Google phone so you're guaranteed the latest updates for 2 years with security updates for 3 years. It's nice having instant access to the latest update and knowing you're going to continue to get them immediately on release for 2 years. I've owned a few Motorola phones and some of them I've had to wait for up to 10 months before I got the latest. This is instant. I know it's something Apple fans have enjoyed since the beginning but it's a nice feeling BATTERY LIFE - I haven't personally experienced any god-like battery life from this device. It's matched what I expect out of a smart phone which is let me make it through an entire day with moderate use without dying. Some people are getting a day out of it with like 8-9 hours of on screen time. I haven't had the pleasure of this occurring yet for me. I usually make it with 2 1/2 hours of on screen time and the battery at 25-30% before I head to bed. This is good enough for me though. I used to have to top off the 5"" Pixel 2 around noon to make sure it lasted the rest of the day. I haven't used my in car charger since I got the XL CAMERA - They always say to save the best for last. This is an understatement for the camera. All you've heard about the camera, it's not an exaggeration. It lives up to all the hype. Pictures take quickly. A few seconds of processing in the back ground and it looks like pro material. I've taken pictures without looking and been amazed at the clarity and detail every single shot. I haven't done too many videos but they record in 4K with optical and software stabilization. I tested this briefly by just running across a room and the final product made it look like I was gliding across the room. Also, if you're a pixel user, you get unlimited storage at full resolution on Google Photos up until 2020. Which is also pretty nice. I've attached a picture of my cat as an example of how good the photos are In conclusion, this phone is worth every penny. If you don't like the XL, you can go with the standard Pixel 2 and get the same features, performance and camera. Just a smaller screen and smaller battery.

21166,B07HKPMFZ5,Wayne Cannon,4,28-Feb-19,False,Cannot charge phone and use headphones at the same time (both require the USB port),"Great phone overall; however, there are two minor annoyances. There is no separate headphone jack -- everything uses the USB-C port. This means that you cannot charge the phone's battery and use headphones at the same time, since they both require the single USB port. The supplied ear buds have a USB-C connector. There is a USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter, so you can use regular headphones. For what it's worth, the supplied ear buds use a slightly stiffer loop in the cable that fits inside the earlobe, which I find much more comfortable and better-retained than traditional ear buds. The back of the phone is so slippery that it will not sit in place on even a very slight (e.g., two-degree) slope without sliding off -- e.g., an open notebook in front of my computer screen. This makes a protective cover mandatory for me, which is not a problem since I have a cover.",4.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed),https://www.amazon.com/Pixel-Phone-XL-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B07HKPMFZ5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CU2Axt3fL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HKPMFZ5,212,319.97,344.0

There was no bubble wrap or anything in the mailing to keep it secure... just the retail box in a mailing bag, which had me a bit worried but nothing ended up damaged.

10330,B01M01YX15,Pinakin P.,1,28-Aug-18,False,Unreliable device - beware of untested/unreliable android upgrades that will mess up this device,"Google products are VERY UNRELIABLE - they push upgrades that mess up the phone and then they deny any help to fix it as there is no protection. I purchased Google Pixel XL last year around this time. They pushed Android 9 (PI) on it couple of weeks ago and the phone died on me. It wont turn ON (not even the boot loader with Power + Volume Down). Google denied to help fix this issue (as the warranty ended just last month) and instead asked me to take it for repair at uBreakiFix. They told me that they have few other phones with same issue. In order to fix it they told me to replace the mother-board - which is $400. Had this been an issue due to my fault, I would have moved on; but this is Google's strategy I think to mess up people's phone by pushing untested and unreliable android upgrades and make them buy protection plan. I am surprised that Google has done such a bad job with testing their new version of android prior to releasing it. I was a big fan of Google until now (was planning on buying their products for smart home). NOT ANYMORE. I am going to stay away from google products and would recommend everyone to do the same. I would suggest: 1. DO NOT TRUST Google Android Upgrades. 2. Google products are unreliable and they don't back their products (they will throw you under the bus once you have issues with your device due to their fault). So stay away from them if possible.

21585,B07JVDQP47,Amazon Customer,4,27-Oct-19,True,I love my Pixel 3 but I wouldn't upgrade from a Pixel 2 for It.,"Bought my Pixel 3 for the camera, I travel a lot and I love taking photos. The Pixel 3 camera In my opinion is amazing but the battery Is terrible. I use my phone all day, I walk to and from work listening to music and sometimes have to use my phone at work as well. Being able to charge my phone at work and the fact that I carry a power bank keeps the battery going fine but I really shouldn't have to do that If they just put a better battery In the phone. Now the fact that the battery does not last long presents more problems for me. The charging port Is also where the headphones go so I cannot listen to music and charge my phone at the same time unless I buy a splitter which means more things I have to carry and potentially lose. You could always argue that I could get wireless headphones but since I travel a lot having more chargers to carry and more things to charge Is a awful Idea. I've also thought about using battery cases but then I can't use my headphones while the battery pack Is on so I may as well stick with the power bank since it holds more power. I was really looking forward to the Pixel 4 but after all the reviews that show the battery kind of sucks and the camera Isn't much better at all I think I'll pass and hold onto my Pixel 3 until the next phone comes out and hope they have some great Improvements.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 Verizon 64GB Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Factory-Unlocked-Black/dp/B07JVDQP47,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jEXWFEGOL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07JVDQP47,63,464.0,799.99

The Pixel XL is not just the latest iteration of ""Nexus"" smartphones. While falling far short of perfection, the Pixel XL still sets a very high bar of hardware design and tight software integration for the entire Android ecosystem to aspire to (if not fully exceed). This Google-branded foray into the high-end smartphone battlefield also falls short of being a full-blown iKiller, but it comes mighty close. First, mention must be made of where the Pixel XL fell short of perfection: - Non-user-removable internal battery While the Pixel XL's on-paper specs for active use and standby charge life are very impressive, consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries suffer irreversible internal damage and loss of calendar life once they are discharged below 50% of their original factory full-charge rating. This is why so many iDevices wind up requiring battery replacement service after ~100-300 full discharge/charge cycles. That's fact, not apocryphal (and true for the majority of consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries). Consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries really benefit from being kept topped-off as much as possible (which is one reason that there's a huge after-market for external battery packs and a cottage industry for replacing failed internal batteries). But, no matter how hard one tries, smartphone batteries just wind up becoming discharged below 50%, which then shortens the calendar life of that battery. Then you have to pay, one way or another, sooner, rather than later, for replacement. Another Lithium-ion battery problem is physical shocks delivered to the battery. It not just S*ms*ng G*l*xy N*t* 7s that melt, catch fire and/or explode. Drop/shock ANY Lithium-ion battery hard enough and you have created an electro-chemical time-bomb that can go into internal cascade thermal overload at some unknowable/unpredictable future date/time. No ""safety circuitry"" can stop it, once it starts. Hard physical shocks can induce short-circuiting inside a consumer electronics Lithium-ion battery. So, you should quickly recycle and replace a Lithium-ion battery that has been physically shocked. These are but two VERY COMPELLING REASONS for end-user replaceable internal smartphone batteries. Yet, Google decided against it. - No built-in wireless charging capability While this is not a must-have, think about how much money Google wants for the Pixel XL and look around and see how many similarly priced smartphones natively support wireless charging. This is a surprising and retro disappointment in the PXL. - No extSDcard slot While this is in keeping with Google's long standing refusal to allow for user-expandable device storage, 32Gb of internal device storage is a pittance in the face of storing 4K video and so-called VR content. My existing production smartphone has 32Gb internal storage, which is 48% full, and a user-added 64Gb 95Mb/sec microSDXC card, which is 70% full. (I do run a number of professional network and IT testing tools on that smartphone, many from the extSdCard.) All of this would NEVER fit in 32Gb. And don't forget how much device storage must be kept freely available for full Android OS upgrades/updates. I don't care for cloud storage of personal/sensitive data, period. Even though Google promises free, unlimited, original resolution image/video cloud storage for Pixel customers, that's going to mostly be useless to me. I don't trust Google with much of anything that I can't automatically TNO-encrypt, pre-cloud, and maintain as TNO-encrypted in-cloud. Also, think about the data plan costs of moving high-res images and 4K videos to-and-from the cloud. And how well do you think 4K video streams over LTE? Cloud is not for me. Please, give me an option to fully utilize a fast 256Gb microSDXC on-board expansion card. Google's hob-nailed boot steps down on my neck by continuing to refuse to support high-speed/high-capacity expansion storage. That is kind of EVIL at these high price points in the Android universe. My push back is to use a USB3.1/USB-C external memory card reader with the PXL for literally external SDcard backup storage. Sadly, I can't conveniently run apps from the card reader, but I can keep tons of data backed-up and freely available to me without the vagaries of ""streaming."" (Just read the horror stories of people who lost way more than they bargained for by placing irreplaceable data in someone else's cloud storage. Yeah, that really does happen.) - The built-in speaker is mono only Again, for the price, look at how many similarly (and even lesser) priced smartphones have built-in stereo speakers. - Only rated IP53 for dust and water splash resistance Smartphone makers keep playing games with the resistance of their devices to environmental particulates and water damage. While I'm not demanding IP-68 rated full submersibility from Google, as long as smartphones continue to use cheap tin for solder joints and board traces, a phone as expensive as the Pixel XL can and should do better than IP-53. Please, Google, set a better standard for everyone else to match. None of these shortcomings are showstoppers, but they are all disappointing displays of Google's stubborn engineering arrogance/hubris. . And now, the MANY THINGS TO REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE PIXEL XL, things that are definitely iSLAMMERS... + Rapid battery charging, longer runtimes and standby charge Battery run times and standby charge life will depend on exactly how you use your phone. That said, the paper specs on the Pixel XLs 3450mAH battery are: 32 hrs LTE talk, 14 hrs LTE data, 14 hrs WiFi, 130 hrs music play, 14 hrs video play and 522 hrs standby. I don't personally expect to see these numbers, myself, because of my app loadout and tendency to find myself in areas of marginal to poor LTE signal coverage (inside Faraday-cage-like structures and/or high ambient EM/RF interference); but these numbers are beefy, nonetheless. As long as Nougat (Android 7.1) doesn't serve up any nasty runaway built-in services/processes, the PXL battery should outlast a Nexus 6 doing the same things. My other smartphone, even with its significantly bigger battery, doesn't come close to the PXL's promise. Google claims the PXL can be charged (from O?) to 7 hrs of talk time in 15 minutes. I have to interpolate 7 hrs talk to mean less than 25% of full charge. If charging rates are linear (which they may not be), that would imply a full charge in something over an hour of continuous charging. While I've never fully discharged the Lithium-ion battery in my production smartphone, I know that fully recovering from a 50% discharge takes slightly less than an hour, and that battery, fully charged, is supposed to hold 4900 mAH, which is considerably more than the PXL's 3450 mAH. So, I'm not sure how rapid Google's rapid charging actually is in comparison. In a real world charging test, with WiFi on, LTE/BT/NFC/GPS off, but PXL otherwise in standby, charging from 79% to 100% took 27 minutes. Another thing to keep in mind is that there's more to the safe and sane ""rapid"" charging of Lithium-ion batteries than just the basic dance of balancing voltage, current and internal temperature. The chemistry and physical internal structure of the battery has to specifically support rapid charging, too. Google is keeping totally mum on exactly which Lithium ion chemistry they chose for the Pixel XL's battery. I can say that the phone does not warm up, at all, during charging, very much unlike my other smartphones. I left a fully charged Pixel XL, with an equivalent production loadout of apps, on standby (WiFi off, LTE off, BT/NFC off, GPS off, Airplane mode on) side-by-side with an older smartphone (that also happens to have a much higher mAH battery than the Pixel XL), for nine hours. At the end of this test, the Pixel XL had drained 1% of it's full charge. The other smartphone drained 63% of it's full charge. Part of the Pixel XL's standby performance could be battery chemistry, part of it is definitely the advanced power management of the Snapdragon 821 cpu. + Bezel-ed 1440v2560 QuadHD AMOLED display The AMOLED display is outstanding even in broad daylight. 534 pixels per inch makes for very vivid/rich images. I don't have to shade the Pixel XL's screen to see what it's showing me in broad daylight. I'm also OK with the scratch resistant Gorilla Glass 4 (vs the more allegedly crack resistant Glass 5), because there's a functional bezel surrounding the screen's edges. (My PXL will live inside an Otter Box Defender case, too). I am adamantly pro-bezel for candybar style devices, as long as that bezel is both functional and durable. I'm not mounting the PXL up on a wall. I don't need any smartphone to be a functionally compromised ""work of art."" My PXL is always going to be in hand or standing by on a custom carry retractable rig or dash mounted. The purpose of a bezel, in my world, is to protect the edges of the glass from damage and prevent unintended screen touches/button presses. Bezels that don't do both are useless to me. Edge-to-edge, bezel-less screen glass really means, to me, more surface area to attract damage and more unintended taps/presses. The bezel on the PXL is AOK by me. + Android Nougat 7.1, Qualcomm Snapdragon 821+Adreno 530, 4GB RAM Pixel XL ships with factory Android 7.1 and keep in mind that Nougat on PXL is a different beast from Nougat on Nexus, and just about anything else, for now. Un-rooted Nougat allows forcing apps to extSdCard so that you may test for yourself whether or not they will run (sans widgets) from extSdCard, by overriding the app's manifest. More power to the End User is a good thing. Surprisingly, there is no real file manager on the PXL's Nougat and Chrome is the only factory installed Internet browser. If you need to setup Microsoft Exchange Server ActiveSync accounts, do *not* disable the Gmail app. Nougat 7.1's Settings | Accounts only lets you setup Google accounts if the Gmail app is disabled. The reasoning behind these decisions by Google eludes me. The Snapdragon 821 is a quad-core CPU, with two full-power and two low-power cores for maximizing performance while also aggressively managing power consumption. The GPU is Adreno 530, 4K and VR capable. RAM is LPDDR4 and absolutely necessary for software to continuously leverage hardware performance. Bravo on all counts. + Main Camera The Pixel XL's main camera is a Sony IMX378 12-megapixel image sensor, with photon gulping 1.55micron pixels and a f/2.0 aperture lens. Google's proprietary (and compute intensive) HDR+ technology makes it the fastest image capturing HDR camera available on a smartphone today, across a range of lighting levels. The PXL can shoot 30 fps 4K video (3840x2160) and uses software video image stabilization, rather than optical image stabilization. That software actively reads the Pixel XL's internal gyro-sensor (@200Hz) to rapidly compute adjustments for shakes/jiggles. Fewer physically moving parts is AOK by me. This camera has no optical zoom, only digital zoom. Normally, I'm an optical zoom bigot, but the Pixel XL's 4K-capable alchemy has expanded my opinion of digital zoom. Plus, if I insisted on optical zoom, I can always clamp on an appropriate third-party helper lens. By default, HDR+ is always enabled and the camera essentially always captures frames in video mode. For still photography, 10 of 30 RAW frames captured are then sampled/composited together to produce a final JPEG image. This alchemy of hardware and software synergy develops significantly better images than from any other smartphone that I have used. The PXL takes the fastest and best non-flash, low-light photos of any smartphone that I have owned. There are downsides though. The main cam can only shoot 12.3MP in 4:3 mode. The best you can get in 16:9 is 8.3MP, because you are cropping away some IMX378 sensor data to simulate a widescreen image. In all of the main camera video modes (720p, 1080p and 4K) you do not have granular control over frame rate. Google Camera v4.2.022.135443920 (a Google Play update to factory Nougat 7.1) does allow you to select a pre-determined high frame rate (""slow motion"") for video on the Pixel XL. Functioning as a GPS-enabled dashcam, the Pixel XL is so good at 1080P night vision that I wish it could project a heads-up display on the windshield. The levels of low-light illumination and contrast are quite remarkable, even with on-coming high beam lights. Everything remains in focus even when traversing pot holes and turns. The only limitation is that the 16x9 landscape video is not wide enough to catch all four corners when stopped at an intersection. An add-on lens will be required to widen the field of view. + 3.5 mm stereo headset jack, USB-C charging/connectivity port Hooray for the stereo headset jack! I deliberately don't use Bluetooth headsets of any kind and have ALWAYS used pro-grade wired headsets with cell phones from Day One, for brain EM/RF safety and conversation privacy. The even bigger deal, for me, is the USB-C charging and connectivity port. USB-C is the unifying data/power port of today and the future. It compliments and exceeds USB 3.1. Plug reversibility means there is no upside-down orientation. USB-C seriously future-proofs the Pixel XL across a wide array of companion devices that support USB-C, DisplayPort 1.3, HDMI 2.0 and/or USB 3.1 protocols. And there are adapter cables for legacy USB. The one thing to be aware of is that improperly terminated USB-C cables can inflict electrical component damage, so make sure you only obtain USB-C cables from reputable makers that properly implement the grounding specs. Because Android implements extSdCard as USB storage, I can use the PXL's USB-C port to connect a USB3.1 compliant, USB-C external memory card reader, which allows for memory card-based local data backup and rapid transfer of bulk data across devices. Google tells me that the PXL's USB-C port is a full implementation, so it is supposed to be able to push 4K video to an external monitor, using an appropriate adapter. + Google Assistant I personally don't trust Google and I'm far from alone in that. I have always HATED the annoying invasiveness of GoogleNOW and it's all-or-nothing ""privacy"" configurability. Now, we get Google Assistant, which is supposed to be gNOW ""on steroids."" (Similar/parallel concerns about privacy invasion and information hemorrhage make me equally despise Microsoft's cynical implementation of Cortana on Windows 10.) I don't want/need any corporation placing a digital diaper around my brain pan in a lop-sided trade for el corpo's definition of ""convenience."" It's bad enough as it is with three-letter-agencies peering into spaces that ought to be private/personal with zero value-add for me. Fortunately, I can go into Nougat's Settings and defang the leaking-to-the-cloud ""features"" in the Google app (trading away OK Google functionality) and Disable or (even better) Uninstall Android Pay, Gmail (with the previously mentioned caveat), Google+, Hangouts, OK Google enrollment, carrier bloatware, etc without ""rooting."" My privacy matters to me. My thought process is not for Google to reverse engineer. I do use highly effective applications, from non-affiliated vendors, for voice command, stand-alone/off-line navigation, traffic conditions, etc. I also use four different security hardened web browsers on each of my mobile devices. The Pixel XL will be no different (although finding reliable offline voice command is proving to be very tricky). Information about me that begins compartmented in the real world needs to stay that way, until I say otherwise, on a case-by-case basis. One time, blanket permissions are an insult to me. I also try not to put things into the cloud unless I can ""TNO"" encrypt, pre-cloud, and keep it that way in-cloud. The only way that Google Assistant can play a role in my world is if the bulk of the processing happens on-device, local to me, with highly granular permissions on and redactions of personally identifiable meta-data that I'm only then willing to share with Google or anyone else on a case-by-case basis. That and only that is Do-ing No Evil by Me. All of that is do-able, too, but Google just doesn't see fit to. + 24x7 technical support During my review of the Pixel XL, Google (not Verizon) pushed the ~33MB 05 Oct 2016 Security Update for Nougat 7.1 to my Pixel XL. (My high-end S... N... # is still waiting its 05 Oct Security Update for Marshmallow 6.0.1 from my ALWAYS-LATE-WITH-THE-PATCHES US other carrier.) Again, bravo, Google. Updates should be direct to device from Google for ALL Androids. 24x7 TS is a must as there is no PDF User Guide available for the Pixel XL. And, yes, it's really 24x7. The on-line FAQs are quaint. I haven't tried Chat Support. I have called in and not gotten answers to some questions that I've posed (like battery chemistry). And, yes, Google's engineers are working on the Bluetooth pairs, then summarily disconnects software bug. + Bottom Line I agree with others that the Pixel XL is very expensive, but, at this time, it's hard to find many of the PXL's features and functionality at any other price point. So, if you need what the PXL has to offer, then I do recommend it.",98.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01LY3OB8D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EfvRF3sHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LY3OB8D,455,185.0,0.0

Since I was happy with the phone, I decided to purchase a Pixel 3 to replace an out-dated Android phone that a relative was using. The phone got here quickly and looked to be in perfect condition. However, when I started setting it up, I noticed there were many problems. It turns out that none of the major sensors are working! The phone doesn't rotate when viewing videos, typing, taking pictures, etc. regardless of whether or not the auto-rotate feature is on. Moreover, the active edge (when you squeeze the phone) did not work at all no matter how much (or little) I squeezed. The ""lift to check"" and ""double tap to wake"" features also didn't work. Finally, the proximity sensor did not work during calls and the ambient light sensor failed to register differences in brightness.

26808,B07YMNLXL3,Tampa Buyer,5,27-Nov-19,True,"5 stars, but the jury is still out","So far after just a week I am going to stay with 5 stars. If that changes I will update the review. Its not perfect, but overall the good outweighs the bad. So here are my notes. Its the only Android I would consider because of security and Google updates. I would only ever buy an unlocked Apple or a Google phone - where the software vendor pushes the updates every month. Otherwise I'm not interested. If you buy another Android phone good luck getting major OS upgrades or even security patches. First, all the nitpicks about battery life: Yeah, its a small phone. Its not like Google put in a small battery just to mess with you. So far, it seems about the same as my Pixel 3 to me: just ok. Unless you work mostly in the wilderness its not really an issue just top off during the day occasionally. (I hike a lot in the wilderness, and I carry a battery pack for those times). So if you need guaranteed all day battery life buy the XL. OK that aside, its a bit faster than my Pixel 3. I noticed one web page in particular that is grossly javascript heavy would load very slowly on my pixel 3 and is much faster on my 4. I’m not a huge fan of the face unlock so far. The old fingerprint reader worked better for me most of the time – you could unlock it as you picked it up. Now I have to wait till I look at it. But I got over that. Its not bad either, and occasionally its better – Lastpass for example, unlocks itself. And heh, lets get real about the flaw that you can have your eyes closed. They plan to fix this, and its really not much less secure than a fingerprint as is. If you are sleeping or dead either one can be bypassed,. The size if just right I don’t want a giant phone. Likewise gestures took a bit of practice. I hate Iphones because of the no back button problem; now I don’t have one either. There is a swipe gesture instead, but its a little slower and less reliable than the old way. Still, I am resisting the temptation to enable the back button so far. The dual sim capability is amazing! I keep a Google Fi eSim onboard with Visible (Verizon MVNO) as my main carrier. The Pixel 4 does a dramatically better job of managing dual sims and either number rings now. Most of all I appreciate the Google commitment to privacy and security. (I could care less how many times they market my web history to advertisers, it doesn’t compromise my security.) I am disappointed I no longer get free full resolution camera uploads but can live with the free high resolution. And really, no earbuds included? Although I am very happy not to have the antiquated headphone jack and I have the google earbuds leftover from previous pixels which are great. I appreciate Amazon having the black Friday sale price of $599 and an extended return period in case it dies! So this phone is a keeper for me.

10452,B01M0PADR4,K S V,1,27-Mar-17,False,Bad Battery and Worse Google Customer Service,"Quick review- Phone has battery issue, less than 2 months old completely dies. Ridiculous google customer service and I am STILL waiting on the replacement phone 3 weeks later. Full review- I purchased a brand new pixel- 32GB Quite Black at the beginning of 2017. The batter never lived up to the claims but I thought it was perhaps from extra use (I don't think I use my phone more than any other American, but I do keep a full schedule). 1.5 months into use it completely dies and will not turn on anymore. My husband has the same phone so we contact their chat line, we have had to use the chat line a few times in the last month and thought it was at least some good option to rival Apple having stores you can walk into. They attempt to give some suggestions, but this thing is DEAD. So they say ok we will replace it, but first you have to mail it in to our facility- issue 1, they say once they look it over and verify that it is a manufacture's defect they will send another one, the process should take max of 2 weeks- issue 2 (seriously who can wait without a phone for 2 weeks, if it were Apple you would walk in and get a new phone right away). Being that we have no choice, we have to agree. They say they will send us a shipping label- issue 3, the shipping label doesn't come through, we call again the next day and they send another one (this is important later). The shipping label says you need to package the phone to the best of your ability and if there is any physical defect when it arrives to them then you will be held accountable- issue 4 (why would they not send you any packaging material if they require it to be in perfect condition when it arrives). We wait and wait on the email to come through that says they received the phone, we email, we call (thank goodness we have a second phone to call with), 2 weeks pass- Issue 5. Different google representatives try different things, but they aren't able to track the phone and say this is out of the ordinary but their records show that our phone has not shown up and basically they are trying to nicely say that we never sent it. By the third e-mail and 4th phone call we are giving the current representative both tracking numbers we have (the first shipping label finally came through) and they had on file the OTHER tracking number for our account- Issue 6. Amazingly when they found the right tracking number (2 weeks after this process started) it JUST showed up at their facility JUST this hour (keep in mind this was at 6pm pacific time). They assured us that the review process should take less than an hour and they would ship us a new phone (at the slowest speed possible) as soon as it was approved. We said that was unacceptable that they needed to overnight it to us, since in their words we ""did nothing wrong, there was some fluke in the process between our drop off and the arrival at their facility""- Issue 7. He had to check with his supervisor because that isn't standard- we told him to please check and even better please let US talk to his supervisor, but we were not allowed to talk to a supervisor- Issue 8. He came back and said it wasn't possible, especially since it was a weekend and the earliest anything could be shipped was Monday, we agreed and said we expect to see it Monday then and he said as soon as it was approved it would be shipped out to us. We were on the phone for over an hour since it was magically found, but he still couldn't see a status update- Issue 8, so he said he would call us back as soon as it was approved so we weren't sitting on the phone and that was fine. 3 hours later he calls, but just to tell us that unfortunately there is no status update but it is almost 10pm our time so he wanted to touch base- issue 9 (so much for a 1 hour approval). We told him we wanted to know ASAP and to call us no matter the time and if we didn't pick up we were asleep. He calls again around midnight but we are asleep, there is still no status update. Three days pass and we are at Monday when we should be having a phone in our hands (about 3 weeks since the process started) and we FINALLY receive an email that the phone has been approved, but they will not grant expedited shipping, it will go through regular shipping- Issue 10. This is a horrible company and system and we have talked to about 10 different customer service representatives and they are very sorry for this ""inconvenience"" of not having a phone for 3 weeks and we have NEVER been allowed to talk to anyone higher up or had ANYTHING done to offset their bad process, not even minimal expedited shipping.",16.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

17315,B0787V183F,Amazonian,5,27-Jun-18,True,Certified refurbished and certified amazing,"I wanted to wait until the Pixel 3, but I found myself in a situation where I needed a new phone sooner than I thought. My 4 year old workhorse, last of its breed (removable battery), Galaxy S5 did not play well with a custom android ROM update. It decided to kill my cell service. The thought of going back to the bloated, ancient, unpatched, vanila android was not appealing at all. A new Pixel 2 was my first choice, but I couldn't get that shipped next day. I ordered this certified refurbished one instead and I wasn't sure what to expect. When I received it, I inspected it closely. I was trying very hard to find any kind of cosmetic flaw. I could not find a single tiny scuff or mark. Not one! That's a great start. It looks brand spanking new. Next, I turned it on. Fast forward a few days, mostly because my service provider support sucks, but I finally got this phone setup and working the way I want. This phone is blazing fast! The camera has some kind of magical software that makes every photo look amazing. I love the front facing stereo speakers. They sound nice and clear. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is positioned perfectly and it works just as perfectly. Compared to my 4 year old Galaxy S5, there is nothing revolutionary here, but every single aspect is done so much better that the overall package is a pretty big leap forward. I can't really say anything negative about it. The only thing that would make this phone perfect for me is if it had a removable battery. I did find one issue, but from what I understand it's a bug with Wifi in the latest version of Android and not specific to this phone. When the phone first tries to connect to my Wifi router at work, it actually causes the router to reboot. After the router reboots, the wifi connection works fine with the phone after that. I don't think it's only Asus, but apparently this is common with Asus routers RT-AC66U and RT-N66U. Asus tries pointing their finger at the phone being the issue, and it probably is due to the bug in android, BUT my phone doesn't kill my Netgear router at home. So clearly, Asus has some blame. No buggy wifi device, no matter how bugged it is should be able to take down an entire network that easily. So if you have one of the routers above, proceed with caution. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a great android device. I'm glad I discovered how great an Amazon certified refurbished phone is because I may never buy new again.

21153,B07HKPMFZ5,MarCarp,4,27-Aug-19,True,'Renewed' looks and functions as if brand new.,"I recently purchased this renewed Pixel 3 XL to replace my (very) aging Samsung Note 3. I'm not going to rave about the performance increase for obvious reasons. I will say that I find the usability (UI) of the Pixel 3 vs the Note 3 to be so delightful. It's simple, fluid, and intuitive. It's really nice to no longer have TouchWiz encapsulating the basic Android UI experience. I didn't realize just how intrusive TouchWiz was until it wasn't there. My Pixel 3 XL came in a white box with an Amazon Basics charger and charge cable. The cable works fine. I have not tested the charger since I use a charge station. The phone itself looks absolutely perfect. No scuffs, scratches, not even a fleck of dust on it. I was able to transfer my contacts via online back up without issue. The camera is amazing, which I realize goes without saying. A quick comment on battery life, I only lost 2% overnight with both wifi and 4G turned ON. My Note 3 will lose almost 20%-30% under similar conditions (even with the new battery that I have for it). Overall, my first impressions are very, very positive. Hopefully time will be as kind to my Pixel 3 XL as it was to my Note 3.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed),https://www.amazon.com/Pixel-Phone-XL-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B07HKPMFZ5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CU2Axt3fL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HKPMFZ5,212,319.97,344.0

26872,B07YMNLXL3,Adrian,1,26-Oct-19,True,What happens when you have a software company designing hardware? Huge ill-informed disappointments.,"I used to wish I had a Pixel 3/3XL instead of my S8+, but I always told myself I would wait for the Pixel 4 to release before blowing a load of cash on a shiny new google device. I used my Pixel 4 for a day before returning it. Pros: 1. Fantastic software - The entire interface, assistant, and just general ""all built in"" feel of using the phone is fantastic. However, Google is at it's core a software company, so this would make sense. It's THEIR ecosystem. We can only expect this. 2. Solid build quality. Feels like a great phone. Responsive and clear display. 3. The camera. I'm gonna miss this. It's pretty great and the magic google works on your photos often works out to make them look instagram/facebook/twitter ready without any tweaking. Cons: 1. The battery life. I can not even begin to state what a huge, massive, gaping CON this is. The night I got it I used it a bit, got the battery down, and gave it a full charge in the morning and started the day with a full battery at about 10 AM. By 6:30 PM with minimal use over the course of the day here and there, 30 minutes of bluetooth music streaming in my car, some browsing etc., it got down to 9%. NOW, like I said, it was at 9% at 6:30 PM. What happened next was amazing. I hopped on the phone and opened Chrome, and while just browsing the web watched the battery drop percent by percent from 9% to dead over the course of SEVEN MINUTES. It just kept ticking down right in front of my eyes. Almost 10% battery life gone over seven minutes of web browsing. This totally blew me away. In case you haven't caught on to everyone's point of judgment yet, the pixel 4 actually has less battery capacity than the Pixel 3. This was huge mistake on Google's part. This device consumes more battery life from a lower total supply. Unforgivable. 2. The whole telephoto thing... Google did a regular lens and a telephoto lens. No ultra-wide. They gave some reason why but it was a bad reason based on how ""they feel."" 3. The price. This is a flagship and is priced like a flagship, but is falling short of cheaper alternatives like the Oneplus 7T. I'm really bummed that this phone didn't work out for me. I just absolutely can not tolerate my phone dying after ~3.5 hours of use. I can't even imagine if I had tried playing Pokemon Go on it or something battery intensive. What if I were in another country and were relying on this thing? It just really doesn't work. I would have dealt with everything/almost anything else if not for the battery life issue. I hope that google really feels some serious scathing pain over this device pushing them to do a better job next year, because I REALLY wanted a good Pixel, but I won't be shocked if by then Amazon has released a phone that outperforms it in every way attached to their own ecosystem, like they have done with countless other products. This could have all been easily figured out and resolved of course, had the company made the specs of their phone public far earlier. The cries of ""what are they thinking?"" could have possibly allowed them to quickly pivot and resolve these issues, but instead they waited until a week before release to show off their paperweight. This has to some degree turned into rambling. I'm annoyed, I'm disappointed, I expected better. Just don't buy this phone. UPDATE: Due to a newer review stating that I ""must have had my phone on max brightness streaming 4K video"" I'm making this update to clarify my usage even further. I had the phone on adaptive brightness as most people would, and at no point did I stream video. It also looks like fake reviews are starting to pop up.

10598,B01M0PADR4,J. Rose,5,26-Oct-16,False,Most advanced phone money can buy,"Received my Pixel phone earlier this week from the Google Play Store. This phone has better build quality than any other consumer smartphone. You can use it in heavy rain (but not submersed in water) without fear of damage. You can also throw it on cement or hardwood floors without getting a single scratch. No other phone can survive that kind of drop. The AMOLED display on the Pixel has better color accuracy than the iPhone 7 Plus's screen. As for performance, the Pixel phone is faster in real world use than the iPhone 7 Plus. This is not due to software tweaks, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor which is noticeable faster than both Apple's A10 processor and the Samsung Exynos processor in international Galaxy S7 phones. The iPhone 7 Plus has significant lag out of the box when it's brand new. The small Pixel phone can last over a day on a single charge under heavy use as long as you limit your use of GPS.

26852,B07YMNLXL3,MBills,5,26-Nov-19,False,The first week was rough. From there it was smooth sailing.,"So I'll pretense this with the fact that I probably would have given this phone a solid 3.5-4 star rating out of the gate, but I toughed it out and I'm glad I did. The battery was draining pretty quickly for the cost that that was really doing it in for me; no other features mattered if I couldn't get through the day to use them. But I gave the phone a chance and I'm really glad that I did. This is the best android phone I've had. Prior to this phone I was bouncing back and forth between the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone X because I loved the iPhone's size camera but I so longed for android's OS which took heavy launcher modification on the Galaxy S8+. In comes the Pixel 4XL, which gave me the stock android I'd missed so dearly since my old Nexus 6. After charging through a couple of battery cycles, the battery is usually sitting at 50% at the end of the day, so for me, the phone usually lasts about 1.5 days solid, no questions. Battery is never a problem. Its unfortunate that this phone caught so much flack for battery drain because in my own tests, idk if they did tweaks with updates or if the battery needed to be exercised, but I never have ANY issues anymore with it after charging it up and draining it the first couple of times. Now it lasts all day. The camera is unreal. Although people will be frustrated that it doesn't have two cameras on front and 3 cameras on back (the wide angle cameras), the front camera is already has a very wide FOV, much wider than the iPhone X, which made it an instant upgrade for me, not to mention the quality was much better. The rear cameras are incredibly crisp, and exactly what I enjoy, which is true color. I'm not a fan of Samsung's camera software which tends to over saturate photos natively, so the Pixels camera is provides photos that are just how you see them which is how I like them. The night site works incredibly well which I've tested extensively inside, outside, on the move, and stationary. The video I can't speak to because I haven't tested. The face unlock is absurdly fast almost to a fault, and it does work at angles which the iPhone does not. It is, although, quite annoying that other apps don't work with it yet. I'm hoping that changes soon. I've tried my hand at a lot of different manufacturers over the years in HTC, Samsung, Google, Apple, Motorola, and LG, and so far the Pixel 4 XL has won me over as my favorite to date.",11.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

26856,B07YMNLXL3,K Tell,1,26-Nov-19,False,Completely not worth it,"Completely not worth the money, and there is little to no improvement from the 3 or the 2. I upgraded from the 2 XL which was and is a really good phone, thinking there was more to this 4 XL. I upgraded my wife's iPhone 6s to the 11 pro and man - if I wasn't such an avid hater of iOS and all things Apple, I would take that phone in an instant. Pixel 4 XL Cons: Battery life sucks already. I can barely make 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., so I imagine this will degrade very fast in the near and distant future. I don't take a lot of pictures, but if I do video it drains quick. Watching videos the same situation. I don't use the phone hardly at all, and text message a lot, and I'm always below 15% every night. Audio port still gone for no reason I mean seriously? The bar across the top. Really? For a sensor that Samsung failed to spread with the Galaxy 5? Really? Swipe my hands really? No wide angle lens like the iPhone 11 pro, but yet a massive box on the back. Ugly. Vibration is still really poor. How can you not have this as a setting to increase? My legs are, as a result of decades of cell phone vibration, immune to Pixel vibration. Tried the iPhone 11 pro and it's much more noticeable. Sound volume still sucks. It just doesn't play loud enough, especially speaker phone. Like seriously it's mandatory to have wireless ear buds just so I can hear anything on my phone? Or a bluetooth speaker? Incessant Google Assistant - Quit asking me to set it up I'm not giving you my voice data regardless of how many times you ask. And last but not least, my biggest gripe with Google services in general - backups. There is ZERO support for full backups of your phone. Especially your SMS and MMS. ZERO. So if you don't use a 3rd party app on a regular basis to backup your phone, you are screwed. Don't ever let anyone tell you different, if you do a factory reset without a backup all of your app data including Messages will be erased and irretrievable. Shame on a billion dollar company to not 1 let you know ahead of time, 2 false advertising that it can even do backups and 3 doesn't provide backup options. SHAME SHAME. Pixel XL 4 Pros: 128 GB of storage? The 90 hz that I can't use in any app but is supposedly there? All in all I'm more than disappointed in myself for buying this thing, especially on launch day when it's dropped $200. And I'm just disappointed in Google. They ruined my experience and there's nothing new on this phone that I didn't already have on my 2 XL. Unfortunately I still like the Google ecosystem but this will be my last Google phone.

10384,B01M0PADR4,Eduardo,5,26-Nov-16,False,The best ANDROID Phone. Period.,"Pros Fastest device ever. Killer Camera Stock Android (Mostly) Beautiful Screen Excellent Build Quality Beautiful (if polarizing) Design Best phone quality Cons Price Some features missing Not Officially Water Resistant Should you buy: Yes! Actual Value: $660 Google has done something amazing. It has gone from the company with the discreet Nexus line to a phone that is literally everywhere. I remember when no one would bat an eye, much less be impressed, from my past Nexus. But this phone has gotten the compliments of everyone it meets. I know that this phone has pretty much divided the Android community and abandoned its budget roots. But if this is the foundation of what is to come, then Google is on a fast track to be the best smartphone. -Design- Beautiful. In one word, this phone is beautiful. I have the very silver model with a white front and rear glass and a light aluminum frame. Now I know a lot of people have given this phone trash talk because it looks like an iPhone. But unless you hold one in your hand, you can’t appreciate the small details that Google has put in their design. The phone is not super slim, but the round borders make it really comfortable to hold in my hand. It is light and balanced with a giant glass window in the rear. I personally like it. It gives it a distinct design that can’t be accused of copying Apple. The is a simple G branding that isn’t as pronounced as the Apple logo, but it is there. The entire construction feels solid with buttons that click with just the right amount of force and no wobbling of any kind. It gives a premium feel that makes it feel as good as the price suggest. Gorilla Glass 4 protects the front of the phone, but the rear glass is something that I’m not sure. It feels the same, but I haven’t confirmed it. -Performance- Okay let’s cut to the chase. This phone is fast. Really fast. Blistering fast. Sure, benchmarks show that the iPhone’s A10 leaves everyone in the dust. But in real world usage, there is no lag. At all. The Snapdragon 821 is the latest and greatest from Qualcomm and it can handle pretty much everything. It can multitask with split screen and it works flawlessly. The phone doesn’t stutter, even with YouTube open on both the app and Chrome (why you would want to do that is another question). I did write most of this review on my Pixel while watching videos, so it definitely has the horsepower. The 4GB of RAM and extremely fast UFS 2.0 storage keeps it running quickly and responsive. There really seems to be no bottlenecks on this phone and that is really impressive. -Software- Android 7.1 comes with the Pixel with the stock experience polished a bit. The launcher is simple and functional and while the round icons might turn off some people, the design is at least consistent going app to app. The UI is extremely simple to use and extremely responsive. But the main feature that is included with the phone is the Google Assistant. She is always alert and ready to respond when saying “Ok Google”. So how useful is she? Very. Think of it as a pocket Alexa with a bit more personality. Asking it any question provides a solid response and gives you the answer directly. Other functions like timer and reminders work flawlessly and almost never fails. Add the voice recognition to it and it is great. Is it perfect? Alas, no. Some questions it can’t find the answer to and it can’t control your smarthome things just yet. It has potential, but it still needs work before it becomes a perfect assistant. -Display- AMOLED screens are technically the best displays available right now (the “technically” is another rant for another time), though Apple has proven that you can get a best in class display using LCD. So how does this look? Well, beautiful. 1080p might not be the highest resolution available, but at 441 pixels per inch, the pixels are virtually indistinguishable. This is compared to the iPhone 7, which has a rather modest 324 pixels per inch. Both are great displays, but the Pixel looks better to my eyes than the iPhone. The contrast is extremely good and colors pop with a slight increase in saturation. The iPhone is technically color accurate and the Samsung S7 is a little more punchier with the color saturation. But the Pixel lands right in the middle and the result is something I rather like. Brightness is very good and is easily readable on both harsh lighting and the blazing sun of California. -Camera- One area where it isn't in the middle is in the camera. But my god is this camera good. The 12.3 MP shooter is paired with a 2.0 aperture lens with PDAF and laser autofocus; but no OIS. But hold on! Before you decide to write off the phone as something that is less than the S7 and iPhone 7, there is something you have to know. It doesn’t matter. Most cameras can get really good photos in great lighting. But the Pixel gets really good colors and great white balance. The details it gets in the images are great and it even gives some great depth of field. But where it really shines is in low light. With barely any light, the camera manages to focus, get some detail, and light up the photos. It just manages to get a great shot every time. The video is also silky smooth with EIS managing to keep everything stable. Is it perfect? Nope. The autofocus is a bit finicky at times and OIS would make this amazing camera setup even better, particularly where longer exposure is needed to get a better shot. But overall, it can hang with the best phones this year. -CONTROVERSY (Personal rant)- Okay. Let’s address the elephant in the room. The price. Now I was a longtime Nexus fan and I have used the 5, 6, and the 5X and the thing I always loved was that it delivered near flagship specs at a great price. It was also the only way to use the latest and greatest that Android could offer. But the Nexus was never the best phone out there. The 5 had terrible battery life, the 6 was too large and too expensive and both had terrible cameras. The 5X and 6P came closest to delivering the ultimate smartphone. The Pixel follows a completely different philosophy. The Pixel is the culmination of what Google can do without a budget restriction; what it can do to make the perfect phone. This Pixel does not fall short in the components department. It is using the best processor, display, material, build quality, and batteries that it has access to. I was a bit bummed that the Pixel’s price wasn’t lower. But if Google wanted to compete head to head with the iPhone, it had to sacrifice its budget market. But in a way, the Nexus line succeeded with its mission. Back when the Nexus 5 was released, there were no budget phones that carried flagship specs at an affordable price. And sure, the Nexus had its faults. But it, along with Motorola, showed the world that it is possible to have a great experience on Android without spending a lot. Now, in 2016, the Nexus doesn’t really have a place to be. There are a number of options ready to address the budget segment of the market. There is: OnePlus One Axon 7 Motorola G4 Plus ASUS Zenfone 3 Alcatel Idol 4S Moto Z Play Honor 8 Where does the Nexus fit in? Honestly, I'm not so sure. None of these phones are perfect. But they more than deliver on the best value per dollar. The only place left to go is the ultra affordable market (which is currently owned by Blu) and the premium market. Considering the lack of progress in that market, I think Google is the right company to go and change that (although it is coming to butt heads with Samsung). So I do understand the frustration that the Nexus fans must be feeling right now. But I also know that they are covered more than ever before. To put it bluntly, stop hating on the Pixel for what it isn’t and appreciate it for what it is. -Conclusion- This phone is not perfect. The Samsung Galaxy S7 has the most features available everywhere and the iPhone just has that premium feel that no other phone can provide. But the Pixel went for a more simplistic route. It doesn’t do all the fancy things that other phones have. But for the essentials and the features it does have, it delivers the best experience in its class. The battery gets through a whole day of use, the camera is the best out there (with the iPhone 7 Plus besting it only because of the 2x zoom), call quality is smooth, and there is literally no lag or stuttering anywhere. Add in the frequent updates and support by Google and this is the equivalent of an Android iPhone. The main issue is the price. Some people might not be willing to spend that much money. But if you can spend the money or want the best of Android, then the Pixel is the best phone available. It is definitely the best phone of 2016.",155.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

17627,B0799ZMY6D,R. M. Swope,5,26-Mar-19,True,Excellent product in NEAR new condition,"At first glance, this refurbished Pixel 2XL from MobiSpree was mint and looked to be in brand new condition. The back didn't have a scratch or smudge on it and the screen initially looked flawless. Upon closer inspection there were 2 or 3 TINY surface scratches on the screen that were barely noticeable with the screen off and definitely not noticeable with the screen on. The speaker grills (both) were fairly dirty, as if a construction worker had this phone for a day or two in a really dusty environment, but it didn't affect the phone's operation at all and I was actually able to clean it up a little bit myself. The phone itself as far as everything else and operation is PERFECT. Battery lasts all day and then some with average use. There have been a few times already where I was lighter on my phone usage that day and I around 7 or 8pm I look at my phone and it's still at 60 or 70% (and that's getting up and taking it off the charger at 5AM). There are ZERO functional issues with this phone and I would buy it again in a heartbeat... Thankfully I don't think I will need to as I'm sure this thing will last quite a few years! The ONLY issue is not a refurb or seller issue, but a Pixel 2XL issue and I thought I'd shed some light on it. My bottom speaker sounded muffled/metallic and blown out with the volume over 50%, especially after 75%. I contacted MobiSpree and they were more than willing to refund me (great service!), but I did some quick research and found out apparently it's the result of a loose speaker grill and was very common among Pixel 2XL devices. Following instruction on another website, I took a store rewards card (hard but pliable plastic) and used the corner of it to press gently down on the grill from the middle to each edge (be sure not to press TOO hard, as I've read you can heard a POP and it is actually the waterproofing seal that breaks, so don't do that). I did this 2 or 3 times and it completely fixed my issue. I can now have my phone at 100% volume and it sounds tons better than my last phone at max volume.

10612,B01M1CT4PT,Samuel Smith,1,26-Mar-18,True,"Not New, got scammed by Tek Deals","*edit, moved from 5-1 star* The phone suddenly stopped taking a charge. When I tried to get the phone warranty repaired by Google they stated that the phone was registered under a different email address and was outside of it's warranty period. The phone seemed to be new in package but it was instead a very good re-packaging that simulated new-in-box. Beware, Tek Deals does not sell this as a new phone! Beware. So, 1 star for a refurb phone that failed after only 6 months. I ordered this phone for my wife since the Nexus 6 she inherited from me had the speaker die. We decided that it was finally time for her to get a high quality, not-used phone but she was not willing to spend the money for the latest Pixel generation. From my use and testing, the gen1 Pixel XL is almost as good as it's 2nd gen product. Everything works flawlessly and it is super fast. The camera is amazing, fast and my wife loves it. Since she got the new phone, especially with the unlimited picture upload to Google Photos, she has been taking pictures like a fiend. She cannot stop gushing over how much better the phone is than any she has had. Just a quick note, the only thing gained in the new generation is the ""Squeeze for Google Assistant"" and the auto-song detection. Having used both the XL and the XL 2 now, I can say that there is no real notable difference in performance which makes this phone an even better value. We ordered this using the seller Tek Deals and it came New with the manufacturer seal still in tact. Having only spent $500 for a phone that costs $650 through the Google Play Store is an amazing savings. We even contacted Google to make sure they will still honor the warranty and they confirmed they would. If you want a brand new phone high-end phone but don't want to pay current gen prices, you cannot go wrong with this phone. **Edit** I forgot to mention that the phone received is unlocked, and is NOT the VZW version. I was able to enable OEM unlocking and unlocked the bootloader without issue, just an FYI in case you want to Root this phone or install a Custom ROM/Kernal.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (Really Blue),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01M1CT4PT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a8aj2F2HL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M1CT4PT,20,289.97,0.0

15981,B0766TPHSH,Joshua,5,26-Mar-18,False,"Excellent phone, but a bit fragile and slightly grainy image in VR","This would be a 4.5 star review, but Amazon doesn't do partial stars, so I'm rounding up. Got one of these just over a week ago after my old Nexus 5X took a swim. (No big deal, I needed to replace it eventually anyhow, I guess.) So, first off, let's start with the bad things I've noticed so far: - Fragile. This thing is glass front and back, and a direct hit on a solid surface could crack and/or shatter it pretty easily. (In fact, this happened to mine on day 2, but I was fortunate enough to get the screen replaced the same day.) - Slippery. The phone itself doesn't have a lot of grip directly (part of what led to it taking a spill on day 2). (Note that I've since resolved both of these issues by putting it in a protective case, and have not had issues since. I'm not deducting any stars for this.) - Slightly grainy images. I didn't really notice this until I started using the phone for VR, at which point it became obvious at first, and within a few minutes I forgot about it. (This is my half-star deduction.) Now that that's over, let's talk about the good: - Battery life is fantastic. If I'm not abusing VR (how to kill your phone battery 101)...this easily lasts a day, even under moderately heavy use. (If I'm abusing VR, I have a charger nearby, but it can still go a few hours.) - Volume is fantastic. - Phone is fast, and other than the graininess mentioned above (that I only even noticed in VR)....picture looks good as well. - Is apparently water resistant (although I'm not testing this) Finally, the ""could be better, but not quite 'bad'"": - No SD card slot (why phone makers moved away from this idk) - No removable battery - No wireless charging - No headphone jack (bluetooth works great, though)",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0766TPHSH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dXcgzgqkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0766TPHSH,153,409.88,0.0

Calling Abe's one person was rude and told me to bad so sad and the other person was nice, but directed me to Google. I can't say how frustrating this is having a retailer that won't help or give you get warranty support and a manufacturer that doesn't stand behind the phone.

21152,B07HKPMFZ5,Amazon Customer,5,26-Aug-19,True,F A N T A S T I C Phone!,"I've owned four iterations of the iPhone and another five Androids, including the Moto Droid Maxx, the Galaxy SIII and S5, and the Note 2 before the most recent Galaxy S7, so I have a solid base of experience in this field. Pros: Excellent battery life, strong and durable, blazing fast, gorgeous large screen/, amazing camera, utilization of the USB-C reversible charge cable. I love this phone and have been nothing short of impressed with it through two months of use. The battery can last 14 hours with moderate to heavy use. I am a photography nut and the camera blows me away consistently. I'm also something of a stickler on the display and the screen is incredible. Cons: No headphone port, which is only a con if you use headphones. No back/menu buttons. I've been using the S7 for close to three years and have always had the back button on my androids. This one eliminates that feature and through two months of use, I still haven't got used to it not being there. The phone isn't truly unlocked. I haven't figured out how to use tethering with this phone on my StraightTalk plan even though I could do it on my old S7. I keep getting ""you aren't subscribed to this service"" and no apps seem to have the workaround. Conclusion: Great phone, especially for this price point.

So I decided to order another to get one with a better battery. The second arrived with the microphone not working. After troubleshooting contacted amazon and a replacement unit was quickly sent out. Then I received the replacement and the microphone did not work again and this time the aux jack didn't either. At this point I probably should have just given up, but thought the replacement process went so easy I'll try one more time why not. Big mistake.

26874,B07YMNLXL3,AnarchyJim,3,25-Oct-19,True,First thing to do: Manually update all the apps,"So considering switching from the iPhone and testing this out. We are not off to a good start. First off, I was excited by the possibilities of the new Recorder app and built-in transcription. Turns out, this is not installed by default when you get the phone. It's the old Recorder (version 0.5). To get the new Recorder, along with many of the other features that Google touts the Pixel 4 having, you have to go manually update all the apps (Open the Play Store, Select Your Apps, then Select Updates). THEN it installs Recorder 1.0 which has the transcription stuff. However, this is not obvious. Why would Google ship with Recorder 0.5 and other non-release version apps? Frustrating when you're trying to check out all the 'cool' new features touted at the launch. Apple would never do something like this. At least automatically update all the apps when it does the initial 'Check for System Updates'. Secondly, Google's support is useless. They don't know anything and that's assuming you can figure out how to contact them. The camera is great, but nothing special compared to other phones at this point. The HDR trick they use to deal with low light photos leaves something to be desired. I'm not crazy about the look. With the Just Black phone, both front and back are glass which makes it somewhat slippery. You'll probably need a case with it. It's frosted along the sides which is great, but it'd be better if there was more surface area on the back that was frosted. So, a little disappointed with how frustrating it's been out of the box. Now that everything has been updated, we'll see if the user experience improves. Right now, I'll probably return this and stick with the iPhone.",7.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0
26821,B07YMNLXL3,Alex Milne,5,25-Oct-19,True,The right phone for me,"I spent a few weeks researching phones and ended up going for this one. Did the new release and pre-order deal inform that decision? Certainly. But that wasn't the only factor, and after 2 days, I have no buyer's remorse (yet). The contents of the box are basic - you get a charging cable and a USB port to allow the transfer of data from your old phone, and that's it. No headphones, no dongle, no USB-C to USB cable. The phone is simple, elegant, and light. And that last is not insignificant. Among flagship phones, it's one of the smallest and lightest around, and it fits very neatly in my pocket with minimal bulk. In fact, it's been some time since I had a phone I could comfortably leave in the pocket of my pants while sitting down. The interface is smooth and fast, and while there may be slightly better screens on the more expensive flagship models, it's plenty sharp enough for me. Motion sense it is a bit of a gimmick at this stage - not many app use it yet and it isn't 100% reliable, but it's nice to be able to vaguely waft at my alarm in the morning to snooze it. It just takes less mental energy at a time when my mental energy reserves are at their lowest. It's been reliable enough so far. Another cool new feature is live caption - instant subtitles on any media the phone is playing. I tested this while watching a Thursday Night Football NFL game, and it worked well enough. The feed was a little slow and occassionally struggled with names (Case Keenum was regularly referred to as case kingdom and Stefon Diggs confused it no end, but it got most of the other names right). I often stream football with the volume off and will make good use of this feature. The main event, though, is the camera, and it doesn't disappoint. Yes, there's no wide angle lens, but the basic camera is fairly wide already. If you want full field-of-view that distorts the edges and the verticals, then maybe an iPhone11 is better, but early tests seem to vindicate Pixel's decision to go for 'telephoto' (2x zoom) instead - the zoom is excellent and the portrait mode blows most of the competition out of the water. Images are sharp, colors are represented well and the software allows you to achieve a finer finish than anyone should really expect from the sort of lens and sensor a phone can carry. The photos added to this review show night sight, 8x zoom on the staute of liberty, and a couple of pictures using portrait mode (my cat, and a macro style photo which might be my favouite so far) Battery life is generally listed as the biggest negative of the Pixel 4, but it's been fine for me. I did reduce the frame refresh rate to 60Hz and put it on dark mode (Makes no real difference to me anyway). With those changes, I was able to do 1 hour web surfing, stream an hour of video, spend 1 hour reading an e-book, plus half and hour taking photos, and half an hour listening to music over bluetooth, and at the end of the day I still had 28% battery left. All around, fairly comfortable. If you're not a high-intensity user and you're happy with dark mode and a normal refresh rate, battery shouldn't be a deal breaker. Overall, I wanted a small, light phone with an excellent camera. Now, I have one.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

24792,B07R7DY911,Janet Bloom,3,25-May-19,True,Battery may cause return,"This is my 48- to 72-hour review. I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot. As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power. For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account. I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me. I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer. The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand. The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit. I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system. I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them. Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc. I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos. By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent. 17! I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day. 5pm won't cut it. So, what can you decide in one day? I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games. Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games. The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon. I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel. I really like the phone, but this can't continue. I may need to return it. Is anyone else having battery problems like this. On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly. But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist.",202.0,Google,Google - Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Just Black - G020G,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/dp/B07R7DY911,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-FKC695L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07R7DY911,1,347.99,399.0

All old settings including ring tones and stored music on old SD card transferred over. No micro SD card on Pixel phones (ala Apple) but 128 G storage on makes that irrelevant.

I have jumped around between Apple, Motorola, and HTC and while I have liked most of them, this easily trumps them all. Amazing quality and functionality. If you are connected with Google it is super functional. I use Straight Talk and I do have to say that it took a little bit to get my data connected as the APN didn't auto load. I had to spend some time on the phone with Straight Talk getting the information to put in. The awesome thing is that Pixel allows you to customize and change all of this yourself.

21102,B07HKPMFZ5,Tampa Buyer,5,25-Jun-19,True,Great deal and perfect phone - no eSim,"I received a mint phone that appeared to be new. It had a Google charger and cable, a headphone dongle , a usb adapter, and a sim tool. There were no signs of wear or use. The phone is unlocked and the Verizon version. Verizon stupidly disabled the eSim, so that is the only feature missing compared to the Google version for most people. The bootloader is also locked on Verizon phones, but unless you are a developer it would be fairly senseless to flash your own rom on these if you even knew how. Back to the disabled eSim - its not really a big deal except for one thing - I keep a Google Fi eSim in my phone for travel, so in essence the Google Pixel 3 lines is dual sim sort of, so when Verizon disabled the eSim they killed the dual sim feature. This phone was for my wife who doesn't need the eSim. So the bottom line is - if you don't need the eSim, and you won't unless you want two sims at once, its a beautiful phone at the lowest price online I have seen.

14440,B072N3GKSM,Andrew Doyle,3,25-Jun-18,True,I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW AFTER THREE MONTHS HAVE GONE BY,"As of right now, this phone was a real hassle to get to work, but has been performing phenomenally. Other buyers said that their phone was damaged or had prior scratches when they received it, that didn't happen in my case, the phone looks great. However, trying to get this phone to work with Sprint was a nightmare. It took me two days with customer support to get absolutely nowhere, and in the end they continued to tell me different problems with adding the phone. DO NOT go to Sprint support for this phone. Instead, go to Best Buy to get it done for you. The person there was able to activate it in 15 minutes for Sprint, and actually spoke English. Another reviewer had similar problems with Sprint, and anyone reading should look at his review for a detailed explanation on how to get your phone running, he was a godsend. However, that's not my real gripe. I should have read the reviews closer before purchasing, but many other users said that after the 3 month warranty ended, their phone became glitchy and didn't work anymore. This is unacceptable for something charged at over $200, and I can't recommend you buy this phone at all since there is a chance that this will happen.

10574,B01M0PADR4,g6kmath,1,25-Dec-17,False,Replacement of faulty Pixel while abroad,"2 months after Google shipped me the Pixel it started malfunctioning: it can't place or receive calls (everything else works). More specifically the phone will ring but you cannot hear or be heard. Unfortunately I had moved to France (from NYC) in the meantime to study for a year in Paris. The phone is in perfect condition, it is also under warranty and I had also bought insurance from ProjectFi. After spending hours doing all the possible repair options (including factory reset), chatting with customer service and writing endless emails over a month, Google asked me for a shipping address. I thought Google would finally come through and ship me a replacement phone. Here is their last answer: "" A replacement cannot be provided for in a country where Google does not sell the same device. We gave it a try, but we will not be able to process a replacement while you are in France. The Pixel is not sold by Google in France, and so there is no way to send a replacement in that country. Only thing we can do is wait for your return to the U.S., or check if a family member or friend can go through the replacement process for you."" If you happen to move temporarily outside of the 7 countries where Google sells the Pixel, you will not be able to receive any support regardless of whether the device they sold you is faulty. The only offer the internet giant can offer: you take the risk of shipping damage, customs delay, and bear the cost of shipping both ways internationally to a friend, give them your gmail password (great security!) and have them process the replacement from your google account...or you could wait months without being able to place a call till you return to the USA.

15918,B0766TPHSH,elzilio,5,25-Apr-18,True,Great battery and camera,"I’ve been using the Pixel 2 XL for a few weeks now. I’m upgrading from a Moto Z I’ve had about a year and a half. There are three main selling points for this phone: Software, camera, and battery. The software is so much more clean and fast than my Moto Z, and most other phones for that matter. Apps all load super quick and I haven’t seen any lag. Apps like Instagram, Google Maps, and Snapchat that used to be slow on my old phone are no longer slow, and games all run smoothly. The camera is probably the best on any phone right now. Every single scene gives me great photos, and it you don’t have to do any manual configuration to get photos to look nice, you just point and shoot. The battery is huge, and is able to last me a full day, from 6:30 AM to 11:00 PM without any issues. A fast charger is included in the box for quick top ups, and since it's USB-C, I can use my MacBook charger if I need to. Other things I like are the squeeze for Google Assistant, which sounds like a gimmick but I actually really like it. The front facing speakers are nice and loud, and the hardware feels very well built. I’m a little disappointed there isn't any wireless charging, but thats certainly not a deal breaker. Some of the cons of this phone are the lack of a headphone jack, and a good always on display. The headphone jack isn’t a huge issue for me, since I mostly use bluetooth, but the always on display is terrible compared to Motorola’s.

15997,B0767538YH,Trevor,2,25-Apr-18,True,I Got a Dud.,"I was *really* excited to finally get the Pixel 2. I can't stand big phones but got a great deal on an unused open box 2XL. As soon as I opened the box, I could tell right away the 2XL wasn't going to work out but I thought maybe I would get used to it. Until I turned it on. The blue shift was severe. I should mention that I obsessively research any big expense (cars, electronics, phones, etc.) before purchasing so I knew all about the issues with the 2XL. A lot of people said some of these phones didn't have the blue shift, that some had a warmer color screen, that phones with the blue shift weren't as bad as people made it out to be. I'm a very laid back guy who doesn't need the highest resolution screen or all the bells and whistles but the blue shift on this particular phone was crazy. If I turned it just slightly, no more than 5-10 degrees, it was there. Like so many people, I expect better from a phone that originally cost $950. My cheapo AT&T GoPhone (Samsung Galaxy Express Prime, $50 new from Walmart) had a better viewing angle than this particular Pixel 2XL. Now as I said, NOT ALL PIXEL 2XL PHONES HAVE THIS PROBLEM. There are countless internet articles and forums detailing this. Some have an amazing screen and others have a dud like the one I received. Had there not been any screen issues, I could have gotten used to the overall size of the phone. I didn't use this phone long enough to form an opinion about its performance. Easily no more than 60 seconds of hands-on experience before I put it back in the box to return.",9.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0

26817,B07YMNLXL3,Diego Carrington,4,24-Oct-19,True,"Perfection was so close, but I guess there is always next year.","Leaks and early reviews made people know what was coming and the few details we were missing were a disappointment. Google justifies that a telephoto it's more useful than an ultra wide but when you are joining the big league of flagships you give customers the options that the market offers and in this case I think that the wide angle omission was a big miss. This and the surprise of a smaller battery compared to last year's pixel are the drawbacks that I wanted to get out of the way first. The battery is not great as people expected and on my two day use, I have had around 4 hours of screen on time. I feel like this is making a big favor to goole, and in no way this is a justification, but my smaller battery has made me rethink that probably being on my phone for 4 hours and being stressed about it is probably something I could improve and adjust on my personal time management. Normal phone use with camera use every once in a while is achievable for sure with the regular pixel 4. For me the trade-off of a smaller battery but a more manageable body compared to the XL is worth it. To combat the lack of wide angle, I luckily had a moment wide angle lens I used on my pixel 2 that I did not get rid off when I got my S10e. I can confidently say the convenience of having the lens on the phone is great, but in case of the Samsung lens the quality dropped from the main lens to the wide angle and using the awesome lens from moment doesn't decrease the quality or adds any distortion to the main lens. Having moment announce the support of the Pixel 4 gives me a wide angle and basically convert my two lens to the ideal 3 lens scenario we all wanted. I seriously recommend the products and content Moment has to anyone interested in photography. Now for the good stuff, Pixel 4 shines in what I expected and made me come back for a pixel. I went from Nexus 6p- Samsung s8 and Pixel 2 - Samsung s10 and both times I kept missing my Google phone. If rellying on a camera that will ALWAYS deliver a great photo is something you value, I don't think there is a better option than Pixel. It's more difficult to take a bad photo than it is to take GREAT one. The lack of original quality cloud backup is a bit sour, but you can still back them on a good enough quality, considering most people just like to go back and see their photos on their phones and not for a big print out where amazing quality is required. The price of Google one is also reasonable and gives enough space for original quality backup. Lastly, the screen and 90hz screen are the cherry on top of this cake. If you use your phone, you need to unlock it so having something that makes this process go this smooth because of the early waking up of the phone from the radar to scan for your face it's really wonderful. The 90hz helps on another side of our everyday use equation : scrolling CONSTANTLY. The difference is noticeable and it's something I know I will get used to. As with many other things and features, it's one of the little things techlovers appreciate and other consumers just don't care about. There is no perfect phone but Pixel constantly proved for me that there's no match for their camera and having the best Android experience is what you get. With this year's Pixel 4 you get that plus an awesome clean and finally finger print free construction, a superb pair of speakers that do not make me miss the front firing speakers of the Pixel 2 and some nifty features that scratch my geek technology itch.",8.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0
26802,B07YMNLXL3,Ricochet,3,24-Oct-19,True,Pixel4 - On The Fence With This One - Google Has Cut One too Many Corners Here,"Have been using Android over 10 years and carrying Pixels the last 4 years. Love stock Android. I don't usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don't care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it's predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably read all this elsewhere. I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I'm going to be merciless if the device doesn't stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I've only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid. One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom! 4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p. Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness. Infrared wins. I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It's right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It's a flagship phone, or at least that's what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you've cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device. What's next. Let's see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you. My suggestion, if you didn't jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too. ***Update Daily use Call and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable. I haven't had any performance issues with the device or its OS. Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why. ***Update after 3 weeks of ownership While I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader. Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership. I've only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger. I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing). One thing people and (google) haven't thought of. Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed. Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this. Ok, so what happens when I'm wearing sunglasses? Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this. My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work. But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses. This is still an unknown I guess. I called AT&T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network. Hence the reason why I couldn't activate Wi-Fi calling. It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID. Wi-Fi Calling works now. If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"". You have to call customer care and be really nice. I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call. The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier. Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time. I've had a few dropped calls say when I'm walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi. Mostly however, it works and is stable. For those who have had Google Fi, you'll know exactly what I am talking about. Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi. The new Google Assistant is very good. The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive. Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast. For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective. BIGGEST concern >> the 2800mah battery. Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged. I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning. Well, it hasn't been a problem. I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house. I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen. I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary. I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car. I also use navigation when walking frequently. Normal use and the battery has held up well. This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage. Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected. I'm getting 5-6hrs. If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL. In closing, I have found myself >>inconvenienced<< more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don't have my BT headset with me. Google > BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER. Really pissed me off. I've ordered one. Tired of the inconvenience. With that said, my original recommendation stands. If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT. It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"". Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price. Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage.. Other people have said this too. Google has had several chances to build and release good devices. They just can't get it right. You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise. In the case of the P4, its one after another. ***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership. I am enjoying the phone and it's working as I intended. I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there. As usual Google continues to improve and refine it's OS. Everything just works. This is why I buy Pixels. While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years. It's a phone, it's running the latest version of Android but that's about it. The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that's it. The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving. I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective. Cost to value ratio. They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn't even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away. Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers. Which leads me to ask.. Google are you giving up on Pixel? Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year. Man you guys got some black eyes this year. All avoidable too. I can say this. Nice phone, but I won't buy your device at launch next year. Everyone, I urge you to heed these words. Do not pay full price for this device. I'm not saying don't buy it, but don't buy it at full price.",405.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

16027,B0767538YH,N.Yorker,5,24-Nov-17,False,There's NOTHING better out there.,"I've had the Pixel XL 2 for almost a month now, and can conclusively say it is the best phone I have ever used. My previous phones in order of last use: Note 8, iPhone 7, HTC 10, S7 edge, Nexus 6P, etc. Of all my previous phones, the Pixel XL 2 reminds me the most of the 6P, but it supersedes it in every category. Screen 8.5: There is a lot of commentary about how awful this screen is that you'd think it was unusable or caused blindness. That couldn't be further from the truth. This OLED screen is gorgeous. Blacks are pitch black, so contrast is infinite. Images pop in saturated mode just like any Samsung OLED screen, but saturated mode looks awful just like Samsung screens do. Those colors aren't real. You have three color modes: natural (sRGB), boosted and saturated. If you want a near-perfect accurate screen in sRGB mode, this screen will give you that. If you want saturation, now you have the option also. As for screen grain and uneven distribution of colors, those are defects. Return your phone for an exchange if you see any of that. I'm coming from a Note 8, and I honestly only notice ONE difference between the two screens: brightness. The Note 8 was much brighter outside. But indoors, I have the exact same experience. Responsiveness 10: Most responsive phone in existence. Shames the Note 8 with 6GB of RAM. I even find it smoother than the latest iPhone 8. Google is up to something here, and it shows. I've gone through a lot of phones in the last 3 years, and this is the first month I've spent with a phone where I did not want to immediately go back to a previous device. I tap, things open. I click home, and things close. Immediately. No hangs. No stutters. No nonsense. I don't do games. So pretty much all my apps stay in memory, and multi-tasking is immediate. If you game, you'll find yourself reloading since there is only 4gigs of ram here. Software 10: There is no smarter phone out there. It is simple, unobtrusive, quick, responsive, right when you need it and beautiful. Very iPhone-like. But it outdoes Apple in ways I never thought possible. Google assistant tells you your commute right when you get up, and it responds by a simple squeeze. You can unlock the phone by saying: ""Ok Google."" It unlocks by your voice only, so it's safe. At this point, I find every single google offering better than what apple has on their iPhones: google docs, google music, google photos, etc. Camera 10: The camera is a bit ridiculous. It is just mind-boggling how much better this camera is compared to everything else out there. It is a simple point and shoot. No dual camera. No manual controls except for exposure level. But the amount of detail on the images is stunning. The pictures look very ""PixelESQUE."" I know immediately if I'm looking at a Pixel shot due to the sheer amount of detail. The Note 8 photos I shoot look soft and extremely saturated compared to everything that comes out of the Pixel 2 XL. Google is already THE LEADER without a second camera, if they add a second lens next year, the competition is in for some work. Battery Life 10: I'm getting around 6-7 hours of screen on time with 13-16 hours in between charges. I have NEVER had this type of battery with a phone. Usage differs between users, so those stats don't mean much for other people. The Pixel 2 XL also comes with first-of-a-kind tech on Android where battery adapts to the user and reports accurate battery life based on usage. It learns your patterns. This is the definition of a smartphone. If you want the best phone out there right now, you have three options: iPhone 8Plus/X, Note 8 and the Pixel XL 2. In my experience, the only thing these phones have that are superior to the Pixel line is the screen. But it is not the enormous difference people are making it out to be. It is the difference between a perfect 10 to an 8.5, and I only give the Pixel XL 2 a score of an 8 because it is technically inferior: it turns bluer than the competition at slighter angles, it is less bright, it suffers from black smearing when the screen is at 0% brightness, etc. These problems are technical for a reason. You don't notice them unless you're looking for them. The great majority of users do not look at images at angles or measure light deviations at angle intervals; most people do not use their phones at 0% brightness, and if they do, it is most likely a quick exercise. If you're hesitant about purchasing this phone due to screen issues, do not be. The screen is still magnificent in its own right, and a pleasure to use.",67.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0

10394,B01M0PADR4,Jenni K.,5,24-Jun-19,True,I LOVE THIS PHONE,"I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, so I'll be honest in saying that really anything was probably going to be a step up. When I was looking for a new phone, I really wanted something with a nice camera. The Google Pixel XL certainly delivers. The camera is great for snapping selfies, or, if you're me, taking tons of photos of your dog. They look good in most lighting situations, but obviously will turn out way better in brighter light (such as natural light from the sun) rather than low light / dim lighting. Either way, I'm impressed with the crisp, detailed photos I can get and with this phone my dog just might become an Instagram celebrity. The only thing I don't necessarily like about the phone is that there is no SD card slot. I purchased the 35gb version just after Christmas (so late December/early January) and so far after nearly 7 months have not maxed out the memory. I imagine when I do it will be because of the thousands of high quality dog photos I've been taking (plus a handful of short videos), which I'll just move to a flashdrive or something. Photos are automatically backed up to a cloud if you so choose (which i believe is connected to your google drive??) but i honestly have no idea how to access that, so I'd rather save them externally myself. Overall the phone is responsive and easy to use, I love the camera and the fingerprint scanner is a nice touch that I never knew I needed. The battery usually lasts me about 2 - 2.5 days, but I tend to use my computer a whole lot more than I use my phone. How long it will last depends on how much you're using it, of course. I bought this product used from the seller ""TheGizmoTrader"" who I would recommend because their listings all have photos of the phone so you can see the amount of wear. The phone I picked was listed as ""very good"" quality and looks almost new, aside from a very thin hairline scratch on the screen which is almost unnoticeable. I also received the phone within a week of purchasing it, so I believe this seller is great at getting orders out in a timely manner. If you're on a budget and you want a nice phone, I recommend buying used. I can't even tell that the phone was used before me as it still runs just as well, and I have a case protecting it anyway so any minor scuffs on the body are covered. Overall I'm still so glad that I bought this phone and I would totally buy a Google phone in the future!",1.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

10151,B01LY3OB8D,Mike,1,24-Dec-16,True,A short review- just like the amount of time I was able to tolerate with the phone.,"I experienced an issue where my order got lost in transit and I had to go retrieve it. It was the strangest thing. Apart from that, here is a review on the device itself: It's basically like how all the YouTube reviews claim it to be. Excellent battery life. Quick and snappy performance. Visually ugly industrial design (I had to get a case for it that made it slightly more bearable to look at and hold). OS support for at least the next two years. Cloud integration, etc. The be-all and end-all to this phone was the highly-touted camera. Google has the gall to market the Pixel line as the best in its class- compared to any smartphone available on the market. In a day and age where smartphones are replacing point-and-shoots, this is a very important thing to consider. Nearly all my photographs had a noticeable halo at the opposite corner of where a light source would shine. The end result is something unusable. I have no doubt in my mind that this was a physical design fault. Google released a statement saying that they'll incorporate a software fix for this issue, but you can't fix that issue in real-time when shooting a video. Internet keyboard warriors suggest you take a photograph facing away from a light source. I'm the type of person that like to capture moments quickly before the opportunity goes away. I won't have the luxury of framing subjects facing away from a light source most of the time. RIP candid shots. I returned the device because of all the issues I came across just trying to get my hands on the phone, just to find out that one of the key selling points of the phone was garbage. For the high markup this is sold at on Amazon, it definitely was not worth its weight in value.",111.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01LY3OB8D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EfvRF3sHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LY3OB8D,455,185.0,0.0
10174,B01LY3OB8D,Concerned Citizen,5,24-Aug-19,True,"Buy the Model Manufactured On or After January, 2017","I had done much research on this phone, and my conclusion was torn - people either loved it or hated it! I didn't want to end up as one of the latter. I'm happy to say that, at least after almost two months of use, I am very happily one of the former. After reading, on Amazon, many reviews of this phone, I came across one that seemed, to me, the likely pivot-point in deciding into which of the two said camps one would fall -- the manufacture-date. That review (I don't have a link, but it's there if you search) stated that Google had actually lost a class-action lawsuit on these phones (Google Pixel/XL, at least 1st generation), BUT ONLY IF IT WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY, 2017!!! It, or another review, also laid out the decryption-key of the device's serial number, the important digits being the third and fourth; the third being the year from 2010 in which the device was manufactured (e..g 7 indicates 2017), and the fourth being the month (e.g. 1 indicates January). So, I figured that I would buy one (two actually - one for my wife, also) and immediately return the device(s) if the third and fourth digits of the serial number were not, respectively, at least 7 (for 2017) and 1 (for January). I'm happy to write that seller Abe's of Maine (or its current derivation) gave me two that exceeded that month by several (75 and 76). So, I kept the device(s) and am darn happy I did! They perform exceptionally, and are the best smartphones my wife and I have ever owned (I'll leave the particulars to all the other supportive reviews, as there are many).",1.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01LY3OB8D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EfvRF3sHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LY3OB8D,455,185.0,0.0

10390,B01M0PADR4,Guarana,5,23-May-17,True,Awesome! My new favorite of all time!,"Lengthy Review but worth a read. First pro: and foremost this phone is pretty awesome all around! First con: the device heats up pretty quick when you play heavy games however seems to not get so hot watching Netflix or hulu, tge temperature is about averafe then. Idk uf the heating up from a few minutes of game play is near the alarming temperature or not yet. Gonna do research and compare to my old note device. Seller: I bought this phone ""used like new"" and the package came as if it were sent from Google with the original box and all the necessary items finely packed as if the phone wasnt used. So kudos to the seller for not lying and semding a phone that was beat up. The charging cable was said to be filed down by the seller to fit with bulky cases but thats def no deal breaker at all because I'm sure ill buy a new cable at some point anyways. The phone was unscratched or damaged and had already been factory reset. Setup: Phone setup was the easiest setup I've ever seen on a mobile device personally. There wasnt a self service or cgecking phone status app running in the background knocking out service that I'd have to force close like with my sprint galaxy note 5. There also wasn't an issue popping in a sim card. Just popped​ in the sim card restarted the device and it connected without an issue or extra ingenuity involved. This is how a phone should be! On screen: Being that the phone was manufactured by HTC the srceen looks very much like an htc screen and doesnt get as bright as my note5. Battery: Comparing to my Galaxy note 5 again​, the battery is awesome, much better than my larger battery in my note5 and the software is darn good about shutting down apps that would normally be running in the background unnecessarily. This battery lasts​ me all day and then some. I used to constantly keep power save on 24hrs in attempt to get a decent battery life with my note 5 and any other phone but with the Pixel i actually dont ever feel lile i need it. My battery life is never so horrible that I need to look for ways to save power. I normally get 12hrs out of my battery before really needing a charge. & I purposely try to run out the battery. Camera: The camera is great! Needs a few tweeks to the software but nothing major. I could always download an extra camera apk but i wouldn't get the same great photos. The software does wonders for the pixels camera especially with video recording. Just would like a few things changed like locking in the brightness setting flash and HDR settings small things like that. Again nothing major. Speaker & Pure Android Fingerprint scanner: Plain and simple: the speaker is clear but leaves you looking for more from it but there's always headphones galore & blutooth speakers to make a better experienc.. The pure android experience is a pretty nice feature within itself without the bloatware and sense overlays from manufacturers. Being the first to get updates is cool too. I also noticed i see a lot more apps in the play store that allow me to downlaod the beta versions before they are officially released so that's cool. The fingerprint scanner is pretty cool beijg on the back. I prefer it rather than the one on the note5. Coverage: Comparing to my note5 again haha: Coverage is waaaay better than my note5. Everything from WiFi range & connection strength of that to the strength of the 2g, 3g, & LTE on my pixel is great. I also get way vetter voice coverage so Im usually at full service amd i can still pickup something in bad areas. The pixel also functions on a much wider ramge of frequencies (hence the better signals / connection strength) so I would say this is a true global phone compared to Samsung devices. I used to love my Galaxy but lately its been tough amd has a bunch of small things I'd like to change which I could by rooting if I wanted. so here I am with my Pixel. Some would say it's better to wait for the next one but depending on your situation and needs this may be the perfect fit for you. All in all: I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to future google phones and I feel like i should have been using them since the Nexus days now haha. I think I may do a review on youtube of this phone some day.",14.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0
10114,B01LY3OB8D,michaelpaul50,5,23-May-17,False,Beware: Love Mine But Over 48 Phony 1 Star Reviews By People Who Never Bought A Pixel/Pixel XL Regarding Price/Features/Service,"UPDATE: FIRST: Do not understand why Amazon allows folks who have NEVER purchased a product to write reviews for that product? Of the 53 ONE star reviews the Pixel XL received, only 4, that's right, 4 were written by verified buyers. That's 1 verified buyer for every 13 reviews. In total, almost 1/3 of the ONE star reviews (not one from a verified buyer) were by folks who claimed to have paid at least $1,500, to as much as $2,000, for a Google Pixel XL that lists for $990. While another 1/3 of the ONE star reviews were by folks who clearly stated that they HAD NOT PURCHASED the Pixel/Pixel XL and WOULD NOT PURCHASE it because is was too expensive or they didn't like the provider's plan, mostly Verizon, which, in fact, has nothing to do with the cell. (Check their website, Verizon offers the same ""lousy"" plan whether you're buying a Pixel or a Samsung). Conversely, the Pixel/Pixel XL received about 50 FOUR AND FIVE star reviews of which 46 of the 50 or 92% are from verified buyers. That's almost comical. Only 8% of the ONE star reviews are from verified buyers while 93 % of the FOUR AND FIVE star reviews are from people who made clean, verified purchases through Amazon. Now, who am I supposed to give the greatest weight to? If you adjust the ratings to scrub all the "" One Stars"" attributed to ""not worth the outrageous price"" and the like and spread them evenly across TWO through FIVE Star ratings, then this phone would rate in the 4.2 to 4.3 range instead of 3.6, a 20% difference between make-believe and reality. Yet another unfortunate demonstration that one must read the ONE and TWO star ratings very, very carefully to weed through those left by folks who simply do not know what they are talking about. Sad, but all to often true. However, as a VERIFIED PURCHASER... After carefully reading all the new product reviews on sites such as CNET, Consumer Reports, The WSJ, and many more, I actually purchased a Pixel XL 128GB. No place, absolutely place I looked, had a list price for a new, 2017 Goggle Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black that exceeded $1,000. My Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black arrived about 10 days ago. I purchased an unlocked U.S. version from a merchant with a 97% 365 day Positive Rating fulfilled through Amazon with an Amazon A to z (doesn't work send it back within 30 days) warranty. I purchased an Universal SIM card from Sprint. They overnIghted the card to me and the local store installed it and transferred all the data. Total cost to me for the Pixel, SIM card, shipping, and taxes were $997. I am in 7th heaven.The phone is easy to use, has a one to one interface that lets you sync directly with any Windows firmware or software via cable or cloud, 100% drag and drop interface, UNLIMITED FREE cloud storage between ANY model Pixel and Google Cloud. Over 800,000 free/low cost apps. Latest, full featured/experimental Android OS. And anything, anything, that was preloaded at the time of purchase can be used as is, used in the experimental developer mode or dragged into the trash and permanently removed.

16008,B0767538YH,E Clay,3,23-Mar-18,False,I love my Pixel 2 XL,"Well???? I love my Pixel 2 XL. I have had this phone for less than 2 weeks since I made the MAJOR investment in purchase this ($900 something). I got it in a timely fashion. Right out of the box I was impressed. I love the single lens camera look and the fingerprint sensor on the back. Where it should be. After doing a battery drain and charging it back up to 100% I began to us it and I am very impressed. It seems quicker/snappier than its predecessors. The real selling point is the PURE Android experience. It doesn’t have the ads and extra apps like Facebook, Uber, IHeart Radio and Carrier Apps. It only comes with 21 (last I counted) pre-installed apps. On my old phone I jail broke/ rooted it to get the features to do what this phone already comes with. Like killing apps in the back ground and limiting permissions on what apps can have access to. (Why does the calculator need access to your phone book???) Also, the battery life is OUTSTANDING. I tend to use my phone for my business which makes it my second most important tool for what I do. I will have it fully charged at 6:30 in the morning with heavy use during the day. It will still be around 20% at 8 o’clock that night. The automatic music identifier is a great touch as is the camera. I have taken a lot of pics with it and this is the absolute best I’ve ever used or seen. For the average user like me I will never get the full use out of it but, it is good to know it is there. One of the few things I am disappointed about is the Google Photos. I am not good with how it tries to identify everyone in the pics and try to ask you their names. Which it send your photos to the Google Cloud. At this point I feel like I am feeding the “Beast”. So I use a third party app for my photos. Another problem that I had was in the first 72 hours my phone kept saying that Google has stopped. Nothing worked after that. I turned it on and off and it still was doing the same thing. I checked for an update which there was and it took care of the problem. But, my real problem is with Google themselves. Two weeks after I bought my phone the prices dropped by $200. So I called and inquired about getting in on this deal and they said that I would have to return my phone and order a new one. First of all, who does that? For an older person like me it takes 3 days to get my phone just the way I want it. So this would mean I would have to put my info back on my old phone (Nexus 6) then transfer it again when I get my new phone. That is just too much trouble. So if I return it they can keep it. I will just get a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s. It’s still $200 cheaper with the discount that Google is giving. I am very disappointed in how Google is handling my situation. I’m pretty sure I am going to return it because it is the principle of it. But, still I refuse to go to Apple due to their control freak OS and I will go back to a flip phone before going to a Samsung. Also, they didn’t send me a survey after I hung up on them",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0

I've bought used phones before and never really had issues as long as they were refurbished. These phones are not being refurbished. I talked to a man who was the service contact provided for this, he said they're phasong out these phones due to complaints and because all of the pixels coming in are trash and Amazon is not vetting the phones or repairing them before resale. Amazon has literally sold me trash. This phone was scratched up and I was okay with that until I realized it had probably been dropped multiple times with no case on it. I had a phone before that I dropped on its side without a case and it had electrical issues afterwards. This phone seemed okay at first but it ran very slow, and suddenly the screen started to go black. I had already ported my number and tried calling someone but the audio jack didn't work, and the actual speaker system wad messed up because I couldn't never be heard when calling. It also made intermittent weird electronic static sounds. This isn't some cheap $5 phone you found in a bin at a garage sale. Amazon is selling these for over $100 and they are very literally the trash that someone else broke and sent back to Amazon. I would advise you not to even try with one of these phones. Based on my conversation with the person who was in charge of complaints, it's not even worth exchanging for the same phone because the whole lot of pixel ones is bad and not being repaired before resale. I have no idea about the pixel 2, but I'm just not even going to mess with this anymore.

26871,B07YMNLXL3,Shanks,2,22-Oct-19,True,Flagship price without the flagship performance/features,"This review is of the white 64GB Pixel 4 (non XL) that I received from Amazon on 10/21/19. I have used it for exactly 48hrs so far and here is my early impressions – Good stuff – 1. The build quality is impressive. The matte back is fingerprint resistant and the phone is a beauty! 2. The dual (Stereo) speakers are loud and have good clarity. 3. Fast charger is included with the phone. Bad stuff – Unfortunately this is a longer list. 1. Battery life is miserable. The phone has a 2800mAh battery that lasted me 18hrs with <30 minutes of screen on time. These 18hrs also included an 8hr of sleep time at night, so users will need to charge this at least twice daily, even with minimal usage. 2. The 90Hz screen is mostly limited to 60Hz. You’ll have to enable “Force 90Hz” option in “Developer settings” if you want to use it in its full glory. 3. The face unlock struggles in dark. It also sometimes does not work until you press the power button to activate the phone (I have radar on, so the phone does know my presence). In absence of other biometric options, a crappy face unlock isn’t ideal. One out of 3 times I had to enter my PIN, as the Face Unlock did not work. Most importantly, it works even with eyes closed, so it means someone can unlock your phone while you are sleeping by just pointing it at your face. 4. There isn't a USB-C earphone included with the phone. 5. There isn't a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle included with the phone to use with headphones. 6. Free unlimited storage on Google Photos is being discontinued with the Pixel 4 and Google wants you to pay for cloud storage. 7. Base model is only 64GB, which is tiny for a phone in 2019. 128GB should have been the base model or at least a memory card slot should have been included. 8. No dual front facing camera like the Pixel 3. 9. No wide angle rear camera – This is a big deal for a 2019 flagship phone. Those who watched the Pixel 4 launch keynote, you know how stupid they sounded when they tried to justify the inclusion of telephote over wide angle. 10. No 60fps or higher video recording at 4K. Google cited that the limited internal storage is the reason they have not enabled higher fps at 4K, even though the hardware is capable. I am speechless…can’t they just give the users an option? 11. Too expensive at $799 for a flagship phone in 2019 with the above flaws. I am going back to my OnePlus phone, which isn’t flawless by any means, but is a very good phone for what it offers and the price it comes at. I can't recommend the Pixel 4 to anyone and don't know if the audience that Google is trying to sell this to, actually exists.

I purchased the Huawei Nexus 6P through Google and loved it. My wife has the Pixel and tried hers out for a week. When the Pixel 2 was launched I decided to purchase it. Things started great! The honeymoon was fantastic! But after a few months and a few OS updates, I started to experience several issues with it. I gone through months of troubleshooting and am now on my 3rd phone. Most of the issues have been worked out except for one HUGE issue. I am unable to maintain a smooth connection on my home WiFi network. I've tried everything and worked with Google support. I get sporadic WiFi connected but has no internet issues constantly. As a result, I am forced to shut down apps or videos several times before things finally reconnect and work again. This also happens on my parent's WiFi. No issues at work or other places. I've also been experiencing text issues the last few weeks, as well. I receive an Error 97: SMS origination denied message when sending texts out. I've spoke to Verizon 4 times and have gone through troubleshooting and they insist there is something wrong with the phone. It has, quite honestly, been maddening. All Google support is willing to do is replace my phone with another refurb. I am beyond frustrated and am extremely disappointed with Google.

In any case, I noticed burn-in along the navigation bar after less than a year even though I had brightness at 50 percent. When viewing the screen at a slight angle, there is a blueish hue on the panel. Google acknowledged the problem and supposedly worked out an assembly line fix with LG (the maker of the phone).

Battery life is more than acceptable, not a top feature. Video stabilization is good, but looks artificial at times. It's different from the iPhone or a GoPro with HyperSmooth. Soli is neat but I don't use it for gestures, just proximity stuff and to speed up face unlock. Screen resolution is a good balance of resolution and performance on the XL.

I had heard that the ability to do this was built into Android 10, but astoundingly, Google didn't build this into their flagship phones. The use of the phone as a phone was just fine but not significantly better than my OnePlus 6t, so I put it back in the box 3 hours after I opened it and sent the phone back. There was nothing truly groundbreaking about it. Our phones are more powerful than many people's laptops.

The problem is not the charger or the mechanics of the connector: my spouse has an identical phone, so it's easy to test the charging equipment and the connector is completely clean. Google ""diagnosed"" it over a web chat (all their service is from overseas, from my experience) and offered me an ""advanced replacement"", which amounts to them sending me a new phone, after which I send this one back. The problem is that any replacement process involves a web page that doesn't work. It has been 4 days since my phone died, and they still have not even started a replacement process: they send me a web link, I click on the web link, and I get a message ""It's not you, it's us. We're working on fixing the problem. Check back soon."" Any calls or chats to the company involve repeated requests from their representatives not to worry: they're working on it. No escalation path is provided, no alternative solutions; if you can't get their link to work, you don't move ahead, and their link doesn't work. Any self-respecting vendor would just send me another phone, but this dystopian giant demands that everyone follow the yellow brick road that leads to a precipice. No wonder people hate google! This is how outsize companies eventually end up being broken up. Edit: It's been a month since I wrote this review, and I've recovered from most of the frustration... Here's how it went: after 7 days, google sorted out it's webpage error, and I was able to return my first phone. Of course, I had to buy a cheap phone in the meantime, to the the tune of about $100. They promptly sent me a second phone (which you have to sign for at home, so have it sent to your place of work!). After about a week, I noticed the front-facing camera didn't work, so I went through the required hour of chat conversation and returned it. The second phone worked otherwise, so it wasn't that big a deal. The third phone arrived, and by this time I am really good at re-installing apps and backups, and this time I actually have the second phone to do it from, so it wasn't too bad. I went on vacation to Paris, and bingo, the third phone dies with a message: ""Slot unbeatable: Load Error"". This is the kiss of death. The phone is now a brick. When I get back from Paris next week, I'll start the return process yet again. Since I now have so much experience with the chat help, I can say that it's not bad (I correct my earlier statement disparaging the chat support), but the phone hardware is apparently garbage (in my experience), so my recommendation is DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM GOOGLE.

It has been 4 days since my phone died, and they still have not even started a replacement process: they send me a web link, I click on the web link, and I get a message ""It's not you, it's us. We're working on fixing the problem. Check back soon."" Any calls or chats to the company involve repeated requests from their representatives not to worry: they're working on it. No escalation path is provided, no alternative solutions; if you can't get their link to work, you don't move ahead, and their link doesn't work. Any self-respecting vendor would just send me another phone, but this dystopian giant demands that everyone follow the yellow brick road that leads to a precipice. No wonder people hate google! This is how outsize companies eventually end up being broken up. Edit: It's been a month since I wrote this review, and I've recovered from most of the frustration... Here's how it went: after 7 days, google sorted out it's webpage error, and I was able to return my first phone. Of course, I had to buy a cheap phone in the meantime, to the the tune of about $100. They promptly sent me a second phone (which you have to sign for at home, so have it sent to your place of work!). After about a week, I noticed the front-facing camera didn't work, so I went through the required hour of chat conversation and returned it. The second phone worked otherwise, so it wasn't that big a deal. The third phone arrived, and by this time I am really good at re-installing apps and backups, and this time I actually have the second phone to do it from, so it wasn't too bad. I went on vacation to Paris, and bingo, the third phone dies with a message: ""Slot unbeatable: Load Error"". This is the kiss of death. The phone is now a brick. When I get back from Paris next week, I'll start the return process yet again. Since I now have so much experience with the chat help, I can say that it's not bad (I correct my earlier statement disparaging the chat support), but the phone hardware is apparently garbage (in my experience), so my recommendation is DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM GOOGLE. And by the way, each time you do one of these returns, they put a $600 hold on your credit card. I have yet to see how that all works out!",2.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 GSM/CDMA Google Unlocked (Clearly White, 64GB, US warranty)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Clearly-warranty/dp/B0766NJPBN,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715rN0Y8PqL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0766NJPBN,153,338.99,0.0

17777,B079C1K282,JD,1,21-Mar-18,False,Speakers are garbage on 2XL,"I've had the Pixel 2 XL for two months. I upgraded from a Nexus 6P on the Verizon network. Screen is not as vibrant as 6P (I don't blast my colors, I prefer a more neutral, natural look). Speakers are garbage on 2XL. Can barely hear the phone ringer & text alerts, for trailers I have to use headphones with that stupid dongle. Plus I'll get popping noise in the ear piece. 6P had a beautiful stereo sound & was more than loud enough to watch a trailer on YouTube. 2XL has TONS, TONS! Of false touches because of the edges. Scolling a web page with one hand, 50/50 chance that it thinks I'm holding the edge while scolling down & it starts selecting words or zooming in or something stupid that I don't intend to do. I hang-up on every 5th call because my cheek hits the call-end icon. WTH!!! Really. That's an issue that was addressed & solved with cell phones about 7 or 8 years ago. My phone single (talking on the phone) is horrible. I get pixelization while talking. You can't make this stuff up! This is 2018 & I dealing with problems from 2010. I update my phone monthly. I've used nothing but Nexus & Motorola phones from the beginning of smart phone history. The Pixel is a Pile. BATTERY: one day normal usage (this is tough to explain). My 6P at the end would get me 8 hrs per charge. This thing will give my 12 hrs one day, 24 hrs the next. So it's a guessing game (I don't have Facebook, actually no social media) the 2 XL gets hot some times. That's a guarantee 12-hour day. It's never the same app twice that makes it hot, can't figure it out. I travel a few times a year. My Nexus would take over my phone with Airline information when in an airport, the pixel, good luck! I can't even get it to list the itinerary half the time. Stuck searching Google cards history or trying to find the original email to figure out my itinerary. Speaking of Google cards, they changed how they work. The new style blows! Can't swipe away cards I don't care about. Have to push a 3-dot icon at the corne--- s#!+ There's that false double-touch coming into play. The part that REALLY upsets me is I paid $499 for my Nexus 6P. This piece of garbage cost me $659. I'm glad I didn't pay for any protection plan. Something tells me this thing isn't gonna make it to 1 year for me. Middle finger to Google! Middle finger to P!xEL 2 XL. One final note. I choose Google phones because of the monthly updates & latest operating system. That's why I don't consider Galaxy S9. That leaves apple. The only phone that keeps an updated operating system.

No need for anything fancy. In the last year leading up to getting the Pixel, though, I had started trying to branch out more and started posting my art on social media, and found myself needing a phone that could record high-quality videos (bonus points for the ability to easily record time lapses) take high-quality photos, and still be able to store all of the aforementioned photos and videos AND multiple editing/social apps without me constantly having to delete content to make room for new things as I had with my previous phone. This phone fit the bill in all categories, even considering the fact that I use it WAY more often than I had previous phones. I left it outside for two hours recently in recording mode to catch a time lapse of the sun setting, and it was totally fine. No app crashing, no overheating, no shutting off or restarting unexpectedly, nada! I was afraid that the quality would decline after a few months as I had experienced before with several phones I've owned, I'm now 7 months in and have had 0 issues with it.

17790,B079C1K282,Alexwin20,2,20-Nov-18,False,Google Didn't Stand by Their Product,"I bought a Pixel 2 XL back in April on a payment plan direct from the Google store. I had the phone for about 3 months in a case I bought from Google When I noticed that it was scratched up pretty badly from everyday wear. Yes, I should have had a screen protector on it but it was too late at this point. So I let that go because it was my fault. Then a month or so after this my niece dropped it while we were walking home from the school bus stop. It wasn't even a bad drop; not only was the screen cracked but the motherboard was also damaged. Because of this I couldn't even enter my pin to unlock the phone. Suffice it to say it was rendered useless. I contacted the Google store and they said that the electrical issue was covered but because the screen was broken I would have to get that repaired before sending it back to Google. That would cost me $220 on top of the monthly payment that I'm still paying by the way. Luckily I have insurance on my phone through AT&T. So I filed a claim with them instead. I got a new Samsung Galaxy S 8 for $75. I've had a lot of phones and I've dropped them on many surfaces including concrete and in none of those cases was the motherboard damaged. Nor were these phones rendered useless from the drops. Anyway the point is that I will never buy another Google product ever again. The pixel 2 XL was so cheaply made that it became scratched almost instantly and it is unable to sustain any kind of damage minor or otherwise without breaking severely. I would not recommend purchasing a google phone or any of their other products after this experience. I expected more from Google but they couldn't even stand by theire product.

15960,B0766TPHSH,Harish,5,20-Mar-18,False,Best smartphone of this Era!,"After using a long lineup of devices manufactured by apple, this particular model manufacture by Google made me so curious. The best camera phone I have ever owned and the Lumia 1020 comes close to this. Google has made justification to thus device by providing timely security updates and they keep this phone buttery smooth. Google Assistant on this phone does wonders and for some particular reason it is super responsive and I can say that it is better than Siri (sorry girl) the battery life on this phone is excellent and it can take on hard hitting. I always play the Asphalt xtreme, into the dead two, shadowgun and shellrazer and this phone never ceases to amaze me, as the battery percentage does not drop drastically like some other phones. If you start with a 100% on a morning and with light to moderate usage, the 3520 mAh battery can make you take this phone to your work on the next day, trust me! Coming to the portrait modes on the front and rear cameras, man they are great. The machine learning on this phone on a whole new level as it learns continuously on the areas it needs to keep out of focus and unlike the iPhone X the front camera detects ears and hair pretty well. The only thing which I do not like about this phone is that it does not have a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The power button the panda version which I have is truly spectacular and the colored power buttons on smartphones have become a thing now. The front facing speakers on this phone are loud and it is great to have this since the last ones which i had tried was on the HTC one M7.

16040,B0767538YH,Fizz Teemo,1,20-Jul-18,False,Before You Buy into the Pixel 2 Hype... Read this!,"Decided to purchase the Pixel 2 from the Verizon store instead of Amazon b/c of previous reviewers claiming they received a different phone (Honor instead of Pixel 2), was super hyped b/c I see MKB using it in all his videos. Unfortunately, I began to have some issues with it after about 3 weeks. First off, I want to say that I like stock Android, but not on this phone. It does not feel like a high quality, well built phone. The audio quality is a 3 out of 10, the finger print sensor works when it wants to (which is hardly ever), and like others have mentioned - it has battery issues. I've had mine die in 4-5.5 hours.

21149,B07HKPMFZ5,Guitarand,1,2-May-19,False,Manufacturer's Warranty is a CHEAT!,"My wife cracked her screen and put in a Verizon insurance claim to get it repaired. However, uBreakiFix said they couldn't repair it because there was an internal PART MISSING. This was clearly a MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I reached out to Verizon and escalated the issue, but they declined to help and sent me to Google tech support. Google also declined saying that I'd need to get the screen fixed before they could help, which left me in a catch-22. So, bottom line, I was sold A DEFECTIVE PHONE and was forced to pay a replacement phone deductible ($199) to get it replaced. I suspect the uBreakiFix contract may have been specifically setup to ensnare customers into paying the full deductible when the screen breaks, while Google manufacturing cut corners on their phones, all so they can't be fixed. I wonder how many more Pixel 3XL phones have this defect and people are stuck paying the high deductible. THIS IS A CHEAT! Shame on Google and Verizon! I will never again buy another Google phone and am seriously considering dumping Verizon after 20+ years of loyalty. So much for the manufacturer's warranty.

I previously used the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Battery life is excellent - up to 4 days with my relatively light use between required charging. The fingerprint unlock mechanism is very fast and quite accurate. Things I miss are wireless charging and microSDXC card support. I initially couldn't transmit SMS messages to a Verizon customer using Hangouts, the native Android Messenger, or Hangouts from a PC (even though I could receive their messages and still reply with MMS messages + had no problems with voice calls). It was awful because it still appeared on my end to be sent successfully. Fortunately, this problem self resolved after a few days. It seems to be a semi common problem when switching to Project Fi after porting a Google Voice/Hangouts number over (or perhaps just getting other cell networks to recognize the 3 back end phone numbers that Project Fi used as not a spam origin).",8.0,Google,Google GA00139-US Pixel 2 64GB Just Black Verizon Wireless Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00139-US-Verizon-Wireless-Smartphone/dp/B076QKMQ81,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614uK75v7EL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B076QKMQ81,23,0.0,0.0

They are honest people and have explained why some customers may have received mismatch replacements. 2. It's been a week now that I bought this phone. I'm very happy with the camera, which was the main reason why I decided to upgrade to one of the better phones out there. Reviews have commented about battery dying so quickly and charging so slowly. I experienced that myself and I don't use that much data that would cause the battery to consume so easily. I have my battery saver on all the time now and a full charge can last for approx 3 days.

Most of the time I'm on wi-fi at work and at home so I didn't notice the issues right away, but eventually after several hours on the phone with my carrier and comparing performance side-by-side with my wife's non-refurbished Pixel 2, I realized that there was just something fundamentally wrong with the phone. Basically I suspect the phone was returned for this reason, was never actually resolved, and then resold to a sucker like me.

15984,B0766TPHSH,R. Perkins,2,2-Apr-18,False,unimpressive for the price,"I was unimpressed with this phone and returned it after 1 day of use. It wasn't that it was a terrible phone, but it felt to me like a phone of half the price masquerading as a top-shelf product. It just isn't. It didn't compare well to my 2+ year old Motorola Droid Turbo, which I switched back to and am still using. Here were the issues I had: - The screen was low quality by several metrics. This is by far the worst thing about this phone. It's reasonably HD in terms of pixel count, but the colors were noticeably more drab and less vibrant than on my droid turbo. Also, for some reason a bunch of images that look super crisp and wonderful on my droid looked pixelly on this phone (I guess hence the name 'pixel'). This wasn't just due to the difference in pixel density either. And here's the worst part: the screen is grainy, as others have complained about. You notice it more on light colors like webpage backgrounds, but it's everywhere. It looks like everything, and I mean everything, has a papery texture to it. I guess this could be a plus for a select few people, but to me it indicates a lower quality screen and could be pretty maddening. Finally, also as others have noticed, it has a pretty strong blue tint at an angle. Not a deal breaker for me on its own, but combined these all make for a pretty crappy screen. Worse than any other phone I've previously owned. - The camera (which is billed as a highlight) just wasn’t that good. Again, the photos on my droid turbo look crisper and the colors look better. What’s all the hype about? Thoroughly unimpressed. - No headphone jack is a big turnoff for me. It comes with an adapter, but it’s long and the connection is not that solid, and it goes into the bottom of the phone so it’s going to be upside down if it’s in your pocket. - It’s pretty plain jane as far as features go. There’s simply not that much to recommend it. A very ‘vanilla’ phone for such a hefty price. The fingerprint recognition to unlock is a nice touch, though the angle of it is awkward when you’re actually holding the phone. On-screen fingerprint recognition would be ideal. All in all, if this phone were priced half of what it currently is, I think it’d be a decent buy. As is, I really don’t know what the hype is about.

16036,B0767538YH,Gao Atamazon,5,19-Nov-18,False,Finally a perfect phone,"A disclaimer: I did not buy the phone here. I bought it used on eBay. So this review is only for the product itself, and had nothing to do with the seller. I had the original Pixel XL and waited for Pixel XL 3. When it finally came out, I was disappointed. No battery life improvement (in fact, it dropped down from Pixel XL 2 according to reviews), and there is that obnoxious notch, even a double notch sometimes. Big turnoffs. So I went ahead to get a used Pixel XL 2 instead. I'm very satisfied. The original Pixel XL was already a great phone. But Pixel XL 2 is about perfect. To me, besides the Pixel line, there is no other option anyway. Reason 1: With Gogle Fi which provides the first and only global network service, the Pixel is really the only global phone. Just travel to another country with an Android phone on Google Fi, and you will understand what I mean by this. Reason 2: I don't want an Apple. And I don't want any third-party renditions of Android either, including Samsung and Huawei, because although they make great hardware, they always manage to damage the true Android experience, both in the user interface and the speed and availability of updates. The only problems I had with the original Pixel XL was that (1) I was running out of storage on the 32 GB; (2) I was desiring a little bit better battery life so it would be able to run through a busy day reliably and comfortably. Better battery life is always desirable. The original Pixel XL had difficulties to last a whole day of heavy use. Even though it is fine 95% of time, just an occasional occurrence of out-of-battery at the end of day is painful enough. As one would be habitually recharging the phone at end of day anyway, at least a whole-day battery life is critically important. Pixel XL 2 solved both problems. In addition, it also has a few nice features that the original Pixel did not have: (1) it has eSIM and can be activated without a physical SIM if you're using Google's Fi network. You can actually insert a physical SIM of an alternative network, but I found that switching back and forth is almost impractical, although possible. Every time when you switch to the physical SIM network, returning back to eSIM would require you to reactivate with Google. Sure reactivation was quite simple, involving just a few clicks, but still it is far from being seamless, and you shouldn't mistake this as a dual-SIM phone. (2) Carriers like Verizon have stopped locking Pixel 2 phones. So you can safely buy a used Verizon Pixel 2 without worrying about being locked on Verizon. The phone will be always activatable on Google Fi, even if you don't have an Fi SIM (see above). (3) The always-on standby screen display is improved, and now not only shows a clock, date, and temperature, but also battery status. There is very little battery draw on the standby screen. To me, this is the perfect phone, and for the first time I believe I may not need a replacement for a few years. In the past, annual replacement, or even midyear replacement had to be made due to lack of satisfaction of the phone performance. Now with Pixel XL 2, if it isn't good for five years, at least I'm expecting three years, which is reasonable. I feel mobile phones as a product evolution have got to a point like what PCs became around 2010. Pixel XL 2 is the proof. Before year 2010, desktop computers were always lacking in some serious aspects, making frequent upgrades necessary. But after year 2010, a well-speced PC could provide a minimum of five years of satisfactory service, and if you're not too picky, perhaps 10 years. Product lifecycle is a big issue. Upgrading a PC or a mobile phone is an extremely costly experience, not just because of the direct costs, but more importantly the time cost. For someone who is choosy on the configurations of PC or phone, switching to a new device is extremely time-consuming. In my own experience, every time when I got a new PC, it would cumulatively cost me a minimum of 20 hours to set everything up to meet my particular requirements. This is mostly system, desktop environment and software configuration. A lot of tweaking is necessary on a new PC. Fortunately, Android has made switching to a new phone a lot easier than switching to a new PC. Most of the switch including app installation, data transfer, and system configuration are made automatic. But not everything, especially when you use many apps that require personalized settings and data configuration. So still, it would take several hours to get everything right. I'm hoping to hold onto the Pixel XL 2 for at least a few years.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0

I like the battery life and speed to charge. When working the video quality is good as is sound quality of the speakers. The problems with the phone have to do with it actually being used as a phone or internet. When I first received it I immediately had issues with it muting out on calls. This problem persists months later much as google had promised over and over they had fixed it. Recently the microphone began to have issues which was is a now documented issue with Google. Google claims that a limited number of phones have seen this hardware defect but a friend at work has the same phone and the same issue so I'm unsure how isolated it really is. Do not believe the hype on the camera the zoom is terrible and the quality of the pictures is like my phone 10 years ago. You can not go easily between video and pictures so you can not snap pictures while doing video like every other phone. There are no text or call notification on the main screen so if you don't her the initial notification you must go into each app to see if you have a missed call or missed text. I really wanted to love this phone but at this point I'd much rather go back to my old, slow phone made by a different manufacturer than deal with this device.

10388,B01M0PADR4,Heike Doyle,5,19-Jul-18,True,Excellent phone even in mid to late 2018,"Excellent phone. Even in mid 2018 this phone runs like a dream. It takes fantastic pictures all of the time and in good lighting it is very difficult to differentiate them from the newer pixel 2's photos.You also get unlimited photo storage on google photos at original quality for two years with this device which is great since that aligns with most peoples upgrade cycles. You also get security and operating system updates from google directly which means that you don't have to worry about your carrier or manufacturer not giving you updates if you're not connected to their network or if that phone isn't popular enough for them to support it anymore. Speaking of carriers, this thing supports every carrier. What a concept. And it's unlocked. On Cricket wireless I was getting great reception in the places where reception could be good and now that I have switched to Google's Project fi, I have lte everywhere pretty much all the time. The screen is legible enough out in sunlight and they've polarized the screen in a way that it only blacks out with polarized sunglasses at 45 degree angles so both landscape and portrait work flawlessly. Type c and the headphone jack are wonderful and the battery life is amazing. I can easily forget to charge my phone one night, then if it's at 40 percent or above I can just use it normally the next day and not worry about it or I can put it on the charger if it's too low and get up to where I need to be to finish the day quickly. I have the usual micro scratches in the front glass but with a case on it there has been no damage to the back glass or fingerprint scanner. No dents or chips or wearing of the anodized aluminum back which feels great if you like that sandblasted aluminum feel and it looks pretty slick in black too. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully and quickly and I love the use of it for pulling down the notification tray. Any who enough of my rambling. This is a great phone for the money now and even in 2018 I can still recommend this phone if you either must have a headphone jack or don't want to shell out the extra cash for new flagships but still want the performance and reliability of one.",3.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

For setup, I moved my SIM card from my old phone to the Pixel, then connected the Pixel to my old phone via USB and copied everything over. No need to talk to anyone at Verizon. Very easy process. Audio quality is noticeably better. The camera is excellent. Battery life is good. I haven't had any trouble making it through the day. Keep in mind there is no headphone jack. The wireless charging works well even with a Spigen case on it. The squeeze for Google Assistant feature hasn't been super helpful, but it may just require a change in usage habits. The same is true for Motion Sense. I haven't dunked it underwater yet, but it should survive for at least 30 minutes at up to 3 ft. deep.

Eg. battery life is perfectly adequate, bezels do not detract from anything, etc. But the omission of the fingerprint reader is unforgivable. I've used all the previous Pixel XL phones and fingerprint readers has become a mandatory feature. The quick and reliable unlocking of the phone and its use in lieu of passwords for apps are indispensable at this point. While face-unlock is a nice gimmick it is very laggy and not reliable enough. Add to this a lack of integration of face-unlock with third-party apps and we end up with half-baked feature. While I ultimately have nothing against face-unlock, it is in no way a replacement for fingerprint reader.

26830,B07YMNLXL3,Matthew Brewbaker,1,19-Dec-19,True,2nd Google phone in 8 months. Neither is fully operational.,"I purchased a Google Pixel 3 on March 11, 2019. Within the first 3 months I noticed freezing when the phone would get hot, mostly when plugged in charging. As time went on, the problem got worse. at the 7 month mark, I reached out to Google support and they advised that I would need to take my device to a repair center (ubreakIfix) and pay for any necessary repairs out of pocket. This was devastating, as I had a OnePlus 1 device for 4-5 years prior to upgrading to the Pixel 3. Of course, the OnePlus 1 was a $299 phone from an unknown company at the time and it was extremely reliable, still to this day working without issue. I declined to spend more money on the Pixel 3, but with it being such a great device (when it worked), I decided to purchase a Pixel 4, although I felt wronged by Google's unwillingness to help with a device I purchased just 7 months prior. Now I've got my Pixel 4 and I'm thrilled to have a phone that won't just freeze in the worst situations, like the Pixel 3 did. The 2nd night, or so, that I had the phone, I went to a family event incredibly excited to try out the camera on this new phone and record some memories. When I arrived, I tried to open my camera and the app crashed. I tried again... crash. I uninstalled and reinstalled and the app was still crashing. Installed security updated, reinstalled camera--still crashing. So, here I am at a family event trying my hardest to fix the camera on my phone. Upon 2nd follow up with Google, I asked that my case be referred to a supervisor. The representative advised that a supervisor would be in touch within 48 hours. No one has proactively followed up with me. Now I'm here, having spent over $1200 on cell phones in 8 months, and neither phone is fully functional. I feel wronged with Google's unwillingness to right the 7-month old freezing issue at their cost, while I feel incredibly disappointed that the 2nd device came with issues right out of the box. So incredibly disenchanted with Google.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

I got the 32GB model, and it works perfectly! Since I switched from my iPhone to the Pixel 1, it's been so easy to use it and so familiar. Not only that, but the Google Assistant helps me a lot with a lot of things, such as alarms, reminders, questions, YouTube video look up, and Spotify. However, it is a mono speaker, so the speaker is on the left side if you're facing the screen. Be aware that the spot on the bottom right that might look like a speaker is not a speaker!! It's actually half decoration and the other half is actually a microphone! The hardware looks beautiful, I even bought myself a Spigen case for it so I wouldn't break it. I've been extremely careful with it so I haven't have a huge demand for a screen protector, and I feel it works fine without one. If you're prone to, well, breaking screens, maybe a screen protector would suit you better. It works perfectly with Verizon's network too! Software-wise, it's up to date, as it lets you go even to Android 9.0! Overall, the phone is extremely good (in my opinion, as an Apple convert) and extremely easy to use.

I was told I could unlock it with my voice if I had no free hands, and it works for an hour or so and then I have to manually put in the code again to unlock it. I have been back to Verizon several times, and they tell me they have fixed the problem, and it will work for a couple hours and then I have to manually put in the code again. I am used to the Amazon Echo, which I LOVE, but this Google assistant is a pain in the neck and almost totally unresponsive. Nothing is easy to find and nothing is easy to do. Every small task involves constant searching and attempts to complete. I hate the interface!! It makes my life a misery, and I love tech, so it is not me. the problems are too numerous to even list. I have had it several months now, and cannot return it, because I wasted the time having the Verizon people try and solve the many problems, which did NOT STAY FIXED for very long each time. Turning the darned thing on is a major problem from the sleep mode. IT IS SO OVERPRICED it is absurd!!! And I am stuck with the darned thing. BE WARNED. it is very expensive garbage.

I've been using an iPhone 4 for the past 5 years, so I was looking forward to this phone feeling like a significant upgrade. However, after 2 weeks of using the Pixel 2, it seems my expectations were too high. Compared to iOS, most things on Pixel 2 feel different but rarely better (or worse, to be fair). For example, Google Assistant feels just as limited as Siri - it's only helpful about 20% of the time I use it. Having everything on my phone synced with my web browser (Chrome) is nice, albeit a bit unnerving - I'm constantly reminded about just how much personal information Google has stored. It's cool being able to sign into a site on my phone for the first time using saved login information from my computer, but this feature is a bit inconsistent and does not always work when I expect it to. I like being able to edit notification settings directly from the app icons on my desktop, but overall I feel like I receive far more notifications than I used to on my iPhone (I think because apps on iOS ask upfront if you want notifications whereas on the Pixel 2 you have to seek out these settings). Speaking of notifications, my phone alerted me my cable bill was do in 24 hours - a bill I had already paid a week prior. I think the phone scanned my emails for bill notifications, yet missed the email confirming I paid. Again, I was a bit unnerved that the phone (or Google, or whatever) is scanning my emails. Naive, I know. The camera's nice, though I still get grainy shots when the lighting isn't great (which may be expected?). Camera quality is neither my priority nor something I know much about so I'm unable to say more than pictures look much better than what I used to get on my dated iPhone. I've really only had 1 bad experience so far: I had to download 5-6 different podcast apps to find one that had all of the functionality I was seeking. For whatever reason, Google's default player, Play Music (not to be confused with Play Store, which is a different default app with a similar triangle logo) is missing one of the podcasts I regularly listen to, and a few of the apps I tried that do have this show were missing functionality I wanted. I eventually found an app called Podcast Republic which seems to suit my needs. All in all, it was a hassle to find what I liked, especially compared to iOS where the default podcast player served me so well. One last note: an app (Animal Crossing) stopped working after an update but restarting my phone resolved the issue. Just like a computer, it seems restarting is now the go-to first step in resolving issues, which is certainly manageable but not ideal. Pixel 2 is fine, I slightly regret the purchase mainly because I had such high hopes.

10374,B01M01YX15,Gadgetabor com,5,17-Oct-17,False,Google ditches the bezels and makes its best phone yet,"There was never any doubt that the second Pixel phone would arrive with anything less than an amazing camera. It's really quick, of course, and has all of Google's top software features. It was always the design that would make or break it - and in many ways, Google has delivered. By going down the same 18:9 aspect ratio and skinny bezel route as Samsung, Apple, LG et al, Google has ensured the Pixel 2 XL feels as modern as its rivals - and that split glass-and-metal rear that was so divisive a year ago has aged better than a fine wine. Sure, finding room for stereo speakers has made it a bit bulkier than the competition, but it sounds fantastic as a result. If you don’t mind the size, and spending the extra, the XL is absolutely the Pixel 2 to buy - the smaller version just feels plain in comparison. It's expensive, but then what flagship phone isn't these days? Google didn’t quite manage it last year, but with the best hardware powering the best version of Android you'll find on any phone, anywhere, the Pixel 2 XL finally feels like the full package. Is it the best Android phone around? Not quite. The Galaxy S8 - and indeed the bigger S8+ - still just about pips it based on its sheer desirability, and comes a close second with camera quality.

26812,B07YMNLXL3,Nicholas Parker,4,17-Nov-19,True,Really cool phone if you give it a chance; another jump in tech for Google,"Professional reviews for phones are usually the best resource. However, that said, I think I should offer another perspective that isn't nearly as negative. In general, I think the reviewers were too harsh. Some of them even had me on the brink of canceling my order. Glad I didn't. I have the 64GB XL. Battery life - I am not seeing much difference from my Pixel 3. The horrible battery life mentioned in some reviews is not my experience. I consider myself an average smartphone user. I'm not a 16 year old on social media all day and I don't play games. I use it all day at work (email, text, in car for music, reading some blogs with videos, the occasional call) and a little at night. When I get home, I have over 50% left. I keep the always-on display on, I use motion sense, all the connection methods are on. The key here is that I don't see a big difference from my past phones. Also - you have to give the Android OS time to use its adaptive battery function to manage various aspects of the phone. It learns your usage patterns and adjusts. This results in better battery life. I saw many reviews where the author didn't give it time. HD Calling on AT&T - I bought this unlocked model on Amazon and when I swapped my SIM out, HD calling works normally. There might be an issue with corporate accounts but search the web and look at what some people did to circumvent it. This is an AT&T issue, not Google's. Motion Sense - no, it doesn't have a lot of active functionality yet, only track skipping and alarm snoozing (which is AWESOME). What many reviews fail to highlight enough is that it augments the face unlock feature by bringing your phone to attention when you reach for it. It also allows you to turn off the always-on display then have it wake only when you are near the phone. New assistant - pretty cool. Many of the basic requests are now handled on the phone, not requiring contact with Google servers. It really speeds things up. As of Nov 1, it does have little things that I hope Google works out. Face Unlock needs to be updated to prevent unlocks when your eyes are closed. It would be nice if Smooth Display (90Hz) worked more often - although, I think the display is awesome as is, it can only get better. Google is planning to fix those. More apps need to support face unlock and that's a total wildcard; depends on the app. LastPass supports it so that's sort of a gateway to your other apps. *UPDATE 11/19/19** Smooth Display (90Hz) has been corrected with the November security update. An already beautiful screen is even better now! Also - LastPass now supports Face Unlock. Finally, you can't deny this is an expensive phone. I got it for, basically, $100 off and that brought it closer to an acceptable price for me. But - it's a personal decision. You'll have to weigh the value and decide if it works for you. If you are considering this phone, I'll be honest, also consider the Pixel 3XL (or Pixel 3). Many of the new features on the 4 will make it to the 3. If you don't need to be on the cutting edge or the extra camera features, the 3/3XL is a great phone! However, you won't be disappointed by the 4XL. After a week of getting used to face unlock and the gestures, I really like this phone. NOTE ON MEMORY - My last two phones were 64GB. Prior to that, I bought 128GB. With my past two phones, I never ran out of space with 64GB. I keep several large music playlists downloaded, I upload all my images to Google Photos and delete them from my phone. Photos: No case.

24790,B07R7DY911,Nate N.,5,17-May-19,False,Great phone; my second Pixel!,"I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store. Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.

24793,B07R7DY911,NOVA John,5,17-May-19,False,Bought it on the day Google announced it,"I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone. I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range. Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.) Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release. The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible. So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update. No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was). However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences. Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me. Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time. I got it in 2 days after Google announced it. Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc. Phone powered right up. Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM. Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs. I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes. Phone is awesome. I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things. I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive. Most importantly, the camera is awesome. Photos are not blurry so far and super clear. I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options. I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it. Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.) It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable. However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges. I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself. The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping. Can't say it's worst, just different. The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years. I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that. The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers. Very pleased so far (will update if that changes). Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife. She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them. Update after 1 month Best phone I've ever had. Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc. I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time. I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures. Battery life is great. I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times. I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue. I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though... 6 months update Here is my update on both my wife and my experience after almost 1/2 a year. So we both have Pixel 3a XL's. Overall, they have been awesome. Camera is awesome, no change. For anyone who just wants to point and click, there is no equal for the price (same as all the media articles). Battery life is great, no complaints. Size is great, especially for reading for those of us who need bigger fonts. So some issues. I had an issue that took a long time to resolve where I was not getting notifications of new voicemails left (using Sprint). Long story short after going to Sprint, working online with Google support, etc. the only way to fix it was to add an app called visual voicemail and sprint hub. This is counter intuitive but it took a huge amount of effort and troubleshooting to resolve. My wife, who had Best Buy setup the phone did not have any issue. She does however have data connection lost issues that is resolved by restarting and I have had it also but not as often. Essentially, the phone stops talking to the Internet. I'm going to try to reset the phone to resolve and then will escalate to Google if it doesn't resolve. Overall, still very pleased with the phones.",206.0,Google,Google - Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Just Black - G020G,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/dp/B07R7DY911,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-FKC695L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07R7DY911,1,347.99,399.0

16025,B0767538YH,rbty,2,17-Dec-17,False,Doesn't deliver on promises.,"Sorry to review this on Amazon, but I purchased my Pixel 2 xl from Project Fi and they don't provide a method for review ANYWHERE. Wanted to love this phone so much that I waited months after placing my order for it to ship. The bells and whistle, super camera, sleek design, Squeeze to activate assistant, etc. were super exciting, but I really wanted something with killer basic features too. My 4 1/2 year old Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was awesome, but just getting old, not holding a charge and suffering from screen burn in. First off, out of the box = the eSim set up (for Project Fi )seems cool but tons of stuff doesn't transfer - phone contacts, etc. took an extra step. So it's only somewhat cool as a way to set it up. Was looking forward to setting up Android Pay and using my phone to pay, couldn't reliably set up my old phone to do that, but to set up Android Pay you are required to use one of the Lock features for the phone, which makes perfect sense. I chose Smartlock using a numerical code as the setup procedure recommends that as the most secure. Then I set my home as a Trusted Place so that I wouldn't have to unlock the device every time I picked it up at home. This feature doesn't really work and, since trying to set it up, I've found many complaints about this among reviewers. When leaving my home the lock feature is supposed to activate. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. This means that if I lose my phone at the store, I'm potentially leaving a non-passwd protected credit card laying around for anyone to use. When I return to my home the ""trusted place' feature always works once - the first time I use the phone after arriving. Every time after that the phone no longer recognizes that it is in the 'trusted place' and I have to unlock it. I was REALLY sucked in by all the ads for how fast this phone charges. Absolutely not. I plugged my phone in at 9:50 pm with an 8% charge, and it reached 100% at 12:20 - 2 1/2 hours later. That is much slower than my 4 1/2 year old Samsung phone, which can still charge fully from a 4% charge in 45 to 50 minutes. This is an absolute fail as far as I'm concerned. Many people complain about the blue tint of the screen when not looking at the screen dead on. It's there, but for some reason doesn't bother me. I DON'T tilt my screen. But I'm not watching movies on the phone, so don't know if it would be a pain under other circumstances. Haven't explored the camera features. Don't want to fall in love with them till I know if I'm keeping the phone. Would have liked to see a future when I could charge this phone cordlessly. Thought everybody was doing that now, but, apparently that will never happen with this phone. When I called Google customer support to get help with my complaints - hoping they were just problems with settings - the rep was super friendly but basically admitted that Project Fi and Pixel phones are ""works in progress"". Her words. That 'everything is beta' mentality of Google's is fine for free ChromeOS on my $250 Chromebook, but for a phone that cost $850 on a network that doesn't deliver on it's central promise (cheap and agile), it's not cool.",30.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0767538YH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OO+yCbvnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0767538YH,66,392.0,0.0

10371,B01M01YX15,Forrest S. Morris Jr.,4,17-Dec-16,False,I have 30 Day's to return it and I'm pretty sure my Note 4 will be home before then,"First off, I wasn't intending buying this or any new phone, but being part of the Note 7 Fiasco not once but twice I broke out my old Note 4 Edge. But alas it was not to be, the repairs Samsung had done just after the first Note 7 BS didn't work and I was lucky to have caught it before the 90 day warranty expiration. Soon to be phoneless as I had to send the Note 4 Back in a timely fashion, I decided to give the Pixel a whirl, I have 30 Day's to return it and I'm pretty sure my Note 4 will be home before then, so why not. Short of it, I settled on the 5 as there are no XL's, unless you want to buy one for 1200+, ha, not!!! It's smaller obviously than my Note's, but it has a reasonable sized screen, smaller than the XL by 1/2 inch or so but still bigger than the I-Phone and close in size to the Samsung S7. What does this phone lack, if 1080P isn't sufficient look elsewhere, lol, I've always been of the impression that yes better resolution is nice, but most of the time this is relative to the screen size, short of it, it's very unlikely you'll ever see the difference between 4K or 1080P or even 720P for that matter on a screen that's maybe 6""s or less. But, this phone like other high end devices does record in 4K for your viewing pleasure on a more substantial Monitor. There is a pixel diff, again it's not likely you'll notice unless seeing that tiny drop of water on a blade of grass is really why you watched the game, or you decide to see how close you can push the phone to your face, maybe just maybe you may notice. So what really matters, well I'm a long time Samsung Fan, maybe toss in a LG/HTC here or there, but Samsung has been my go to for a long time, as apparent as I returned 2 Note 7's. I'll say that yes, Samsung offers up a really nice UI full of Samsung goodies, heart rate monitor, gorgeous handset, lot's of glass, all kinds of software(Bloat), and I like most of it, except the (Bloat). What's the Pixel offer up, a extremely clean version of Android, they say there is some app's, I haven't looked really close, but short of Hacking the phone this may be the cleanest version of Android ever from Verizon. What's this mean, fast, no NO lag, you know how sometimes you flip the screen and sometimes it flips and sometimes it doesn't or sometimes it just sit's and does nothing, that's irritating lag, all those cool and fancy things on the Samsung contribute to that, the phone can lag, apps won't open/close, you push buttons and nothing happens, not so with the Pixel at least not up to now after 3 day's of playing with it. This phone is fast, add in the upgraded processor, which it may seem insignificant, but look up processors and see how much a upgraded latest and greatest Intel is from the less than latest and greatest, making this phone even quicker. As for looks, this is really one of those personal things, subjective, a cell phone is intertwined into much of our lives, so making them personal is how we make it ours. For me, it really doesn't matter what the phone looks like as I'll put some sort of case on it anyway, the front of the phone excepting the large vacant space is standard cell phone look with durable gorilla glass, front and back, I'd say it's nice looking but nothing like the Samsung Note 7. Now for the easy stuff, the fingerprint reader on the back, you know what, that is actually a pretty good place for it, my index finger on my left hand falls on the button when holding the phone, voila it works, I never even bothered to use it on my Note 7's, so in fairness I can't say it's really better or worse, but, in my case it works just fine. The camera is nice, but again, that can be a little subjective as well, perhaps you see to much brightness or I may prefer the sharper image or whatever floats your boat, the camera takes beautiful pic's, so did my Samsung's, it's almost a give in that most good phones take good pic's. Update's, I'm a geek, I like the latest and greatest, if there is a new improved version, I want it, the short of it is, this phone will always get the latest and greatest, no waiting for Samsung to tie the update into their UI or Verizon to meddle with it, this is pure Android from Google, nice to get the operating system free of lot's of BS. So, what's not to like, well no goodies, no monitor on the back by the lens, no fancy integrated software, no plethora of Apps you may or may not like, no Verizon add-ins, not as fancy looking. I think I'm liking this phone, I'm tossed up now, maybe wait for the XL, was going to wait for the Note 8, but this phone intrigues me, and I haven't really tried the Assistant App to speak of, and I'm sure Google will make updating this phone a priority, which means it should get better before the next incarnation. For those confused, there is access to e-mail through Gmail, it's your Pop 3 just not an independent mail box, it's listed as others when adding accounts. There is notifications, turn them on, the basics are all there, all the things to make your phone work appear to be on board, I haven't found any missing parts yet, if there is something you want, more than likely there is a app for it, try MacroDroid for one. As for Bluetooth, I've hooked up my PC, 2 Cars and no issues, sometimes BT can be stubborn and sometimes you need to reset and start over, restart your Phone the car and try again, I've had no dropped calls, and it appears to stay hooked up to my WiFi without issue, not to say it won't just none to date. I'm trying to conclude why 4 stars, I guess because I miss my goodies, but that's not the phones fault, it's what it is, if you buy it you agree that's what you want. It's worth the try, if it doesn't work return it, in the end I may do just that, I got 27 day's to figure it out.",2.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Phone-display-Unlocked/dp/B01M01YX15,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z1TjwnadL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M01YX15,302,219.99,0.0

I wouldn't buy used ones and the current item is all I can try. I read through most reviews and seems it looks risky, some say item not sealed, some say it looks like used. In particular, a buyer said the phone he bought from Abe's Electronics Center isn't sealed, and this is what the seller of current item. I was worried so I send a question to Abe's to confirm, and they say it is brand new. Okay I just trust them, and I've prepared for the worse scenario where I have to return this item if they lied. Fortunately they didn't lie, it indeed is brand new. I've used this phone for a week, there is no problem about it. Except when I first upgrade to Android 8, then to 9, both version makes the phone super lag and slow. So I had to downgrade back to 7.1, but it had nothing to do with the hardware.

10364,B01M01YX15,Elizabeth Z,4,17-Aug-17,False,Set data alerts and limits + monitor apps running in background unless you have unlimited data plan,"Got this for my 20-something daughter at Verizon store very early in July. She still loves, loves, loves it and would give it 5 stars. However, her data usage went from under 2 gigs to over 7 the first month she used it because of default settings allowing so many apps to run in the background, and because of the phone's reluctance to connect to anything less than optimal, super-perfect wi-fi signals. Correcting this has been easy with a bit of attention and vigilance, and luckily we had increased our family data plan to 8G (rather than scaling back to 4G, as the salesperson said we might based on our historical usage) and had 8G of rollover data (now lost - you can only carry over data for one month with Verizon) that would have protected us last month even if my daughter had actually streamed video and actually used much real data (as opposed to background apps). So all is well -- I will continue to watch reviews and may even consider purchasing this phone when I tire of my old Motorola Droid Maxx. But buyer beware: DO read the instructions and take care about what is running in the background, and about setting data alerts and limits even if you think you don't need them (unless you have unlimited data ... then none of this is an issue).",4.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Phone-display-Unlocked/dp/B01M01YX15,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z1TjwnadL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M01YX15,302,219.99,0.0

When I get home I can either do a full re-image and lose all the time I spent setting up a phone and then spend all that time setting it back up. Or I can do a full re-image and send it back to Amazon for a refund/exchange that could again result in a comprised phone. Lovely! Never mind, can't re-image because it came with a locked boot loader. Other than the above, the actual phone is very nice. No factory charger so it charges really, really slow. Update 10/21/19 Phone is a Verizon model and I'm using it on Google Fi. A notification came up saying that Verizon wanted to use my location! Just ridiculous!

I expected features like switching to vibrate mode when any event on my google calendar. The pixel only allows the option to go totally silent. So now I miss messages when I have back to back meetings. Next, the Motorola's Assistant would automatically kick in to voice activation mode when I drove (GPS detects motion). So my text messages were read to me. I expected Google to excel in this area. But it doesn't do any of this! Very frustrating since I didn't even consider that the software on a ""Google"" phone would have worse voice activation features. Also finally recently (1 year later) my ""Google Now"" is acting up. And even though I tell it to work when locked, it sometimes doesn't. This is a huge pain since I don't like messing with my phone when I drive.

I contacted ubreakifix to see if I could Fedex the phone to them with my Fedex account, they said they don't take international mail-in repairs but would put me on a waiting list when they do start taking them.

My other option is to send it to a Google suggested company in the UK (which has terrible reviews on cell phone repair).

Corcoran,5,15-Nov-16,False,An extensive list of Pro's and Con's from months of experience using the phone.,"This is an evaluation of the Verizon offered phones, comparing Pixel XL against Samsung S6 & Note 7 (Used only briefly) PROS of Pixel XL * Overall the radios in this phone function better than the Samsung * Superior cell reception, works in border-line Verizon areas where my Samsung S6 & Note 7 would drop calls while driving (Northern State Parkway at Round Swamp road for instance) * Superior bluetooth sound quality, when paired with a Plantronics Voyager Legend or my car, than the Samsungs (On the Samsungs 1/3 of the time the person on the other side could not hear me good enough, and I had to change to the handset) * When watching video's (embedded in news, youtube, etc.) the performance is far superior over the Samsung S6 and Note 7. I would say 90% of the time I can successfully watch the video on the Pixel XL, where it was less than 20% on the Samsungs. Same Verizon network, same locations in Huntington and Plainview NY. * Battery Life blows away the Samsung S6, somewhat better than Note 7 * USB C charger cord (inserts both ways) makes it easy to plug in power in dark places (Dont need to know which end is up) * Far better speaker than the Galaxy S6 or Note 7. No matter what angle you place the phone in front of you, the speaker is loud and clear * New OS, I like the built in silence mode that you can choose how long the phone needs to be quite for, and then it automatically will go back to normal CONS of Pixel XL * Samsung's UI is better overall, but I got use to the changes except I miss that the Samsung Notification UI that is far far better. It is less cluttered, easier to understand how many messages, voice mails, etc. are pending for me. This is important to me because I have a mix of whats app, sms, emails, and voice mails. I am struggling with this on my PixelXL * Note 7 introduced a terrific capability to juggle multiple bluetooth sources so that my bluetooth earpiece and bluetooth car stereo/phone played together well / were easy to select between on the Note 7 - gosh I miss this. * Not Waterproof - I suspect I enjoy better speaker performance because this isn't waterproof. * No Wireless charging * Finger print scanner is under phone, which means you have to pick it up to unlock it. * The encryption felt more secure on the Samsung. I get to choose the encryption key, there is an entirely different password that must be entered whenever the device is booted, 10 bad attempts erases the phone. Verizon claims the Google Pixel is just as good, just different. I don't know, I am having a hard time believing this. * IT bears repeating ... the Notifications aspects of the Pixel XL is very poor.

24789,B07R7DY911,CynicalBubble2,5,15-May-19,False,Overall Good Value,"This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price. Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack. Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included. I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it). However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices. I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer. I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful! Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!) New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together. Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.",510.0,Google,Google - Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Just Black - G020G,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/dp/B07R7DY911,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-FKC695L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07R7DY911,1,347.99,399.0

Easy to set up, just had to get a SIM card for it from Verizon (only $15). I took it to the store so they could help me get it installed. 20 minutes or less to get it set up! The phone did only come with a basic charger which is just fine that's what the listing stating. If you buy a brand new Pixel 2 it doesn't come with headphones just FYI. It would have been nice if this had come with a headphone adapter and the transfer adapter (if you're switching over from iPhone) but it's only $10 at Best Buy or even less on Amazon for each. So for saving $200+, I'll spend $20. The phone itself is awesome and easy to use/navigate. Display looks amazing and so does the camera.

10367,B01M01YX15,Christian Book Reader,3,15-Mar-17,False,If You Like Windows 10 Phones You are Going to be Disappointed,"I started off with an Android smartphones (HTC, Motorola) early on, and then three years ago purchased a Windows Phone (Lumia Icon). I would have purchased another Windows device after my Icon died, but there are no longer any new Windows smartphones for my service provider, Verizon. So this review is really a comparison between the Pixel and a Windows 10 smartphone. From non-Windows phone users, there is a perception that the Windows 10 phone is a complete dud. I am mostly in agreement when it comes to apps. However, I was mostly able to accomplish everything using the web browser. I expected the Pixel to have a bunch of other wonderful features that I was ""missing"" on my Windows phone. Now, I am finding out that it has lots of apps, but is missing key features from my Windows phone. Cortana worked great in the car. For example, it would read text messages to me via bluetooth, and allow me to reply back with a text. I have yet to find that feature on my Pixel. To get live tile look on the Pixel, it seems you have to load other third party app launchers and other notification apps, and those sometimes will interfere. My Windows phone was quick to set up and I could see all of my live tiles on one page (e.g., text messages, emails, phone calls, weather, news, etc.). With the pixel, the same information is presented in different views/spots. In Windows 10, the live calendar tile and app was nice and simple. The Android calendar widget looks cluttered to me, and I cannot fit everything I want on one page (unlike my Windows phone). I do like the Pixel screen resolution, battery life is great and the camera is nice. I also like the fingerprint security feature. In summary, if you are a Windows phone user, I think you will be disappointed. If you have a service provider that still carries newer Windows phones (e.g, 950), I would suggest sticking with it. If you never used a Windows 10 phone, you will not know the great features you are missing. To Microsoft - Can you please bring to market more Windows phones and figure out the app gap?

I realize that the Google Pixel XL is not the newest version of the phone, but I bought it new and unlocked 128 GB for $200. Much more reasonable then purchasing the Google Pixel 3a for over $600. It's a solid phone and has the newest OS. There is plenty of room for all the apps I need/ want. I am able to use it on the page plus cellular network (Verizon 3rd party), and it makes cellphone ownership much more affordable. Having an unlocked phone is great because now I don't have to pay extra fees and I am not stuck in a lengthy contract. Through page plus cellular, it cost $30 flat a month for unlimited calls and text and 3GB of data.

10266,B01M01YX15,J. S.,5,14-Jun-18,True,Good purchase from HometownDiscounts.,"I purchased this phone new from HometownDiscounts. The phone was as advertised: New (still in original packaging with stickers and wrapped on the items in the box), the right color, and the right model. The phone was unlocked and all I had to do was pop in my SIM card to activate it. I ordered from Canada, and the US Pixel version does, in fact, work on international networks. Really pleased with the service and quality. As for the Pixel itself, I am really happy with it so far. I am a bit of a luddite. I was still using my now almost five year old Nexus 5 up until the screen started peeling off the phone's cracked body. I like what I like and didn't want to spend $1000 on a new phone or get locked into a contract and payment plan. This was the best compromise I could think of, despite the risk of buying third party. The Pixel is surprisingly similar to the Nexus models, which I was very pleased about. I was only surprised because this was Google's entry into the luxury phone market. It retains the best parts of the Nexus phones (clean OS, practical design, etc.) while adding design improvements (great camera, fingerprint reader, better picture and sound, etc.). Overall, a great phone. Note: There is no warranty with this phone, as others have pointed out. The only way to get a warranty is to purchase through Google or a carrier. But considering that you're paying half price for a new phone that is unlocked and that Google doesn't even carry anymore, it's worth the risk to me.",23.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Phone-display-Unlocked/dp/B01M01YX15,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z1TjwnadL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M01YX15,302,219.99,0.0

A *BIG* note though if you intend to root this, do *NOT* connect it to a network first; this is the Verizon version. Mine came with the December software update, which allows you to bypass some of the bootloader restrictions - but the phone does, of course, automatically download and install updates, and the January update fixes the vulnerability that was being used to unlock the bootloader. From what research I can find, you're almost certainly getting the Verizon version from most stores, so the bootloader is likely going to be locked which will prevent you from rooting. Note this is a bootloader issue, not a network issue - the phone itself is unlocked to work on any network as advertised, and happily accepted my Sprint SIM (SIMOLW416Q).

10586,B01M0PADR4,Michelle,3,14-Jun-17,False,Mixed feelings,"I got my XL from Verizon. I chose it because: 1. Unlimited storage of photos and videos 2. Lots of memory 3. It doesn't come preinstalled with all the junk that came on my Samsung 6...that ate up memory and couldn't be deleted. I didn't feel like I ever took lots of photos or videos on my Samsung 6 but I ended up running into memory problems, which I want to avoid going forward. There are some downsides though... 1. It's quiet. The ring tones are quiet. The notifications are quiet. I have the volume turned up high. When it plays music or media, it's fine. But I am missing calls and texts. I also have a random ding that's notifying me of...I don't know what. I can't find what it belongs to. 2. I'm not sure I have the advertised battery life. It seems to poop out earlier than I would expect. I'll have to pay closer attention and request a new phone if it's truly not lasting as long as it should. 3. No message count on text messages. I *really* rely on the visual cue and not having it has been a problem for me. Texts will pop up on the notification screen before you swipe to open the phone but I'm not used to looking there. And my texts are important, I really need static notifications that don't disappear with a swipe. 4. No Verizon suite of tools. I had to ask where the hot spot was. It's tucked away. My Samsung had an icon with all the Verizon stuff I needed. Hot Spot. Voicemail. I miss it. I have no idea where voicemail lives just yet. 5. The Google Assistant is a problem. The Xl came with a 'free' Google Home. Okay. Great. BUT when I want to do something on my phone and say 'Okay Google' almost anywhere in my house (the thing has the hearing of a werewolf), it defaults to Google Home. Well, if I wanted GH to do the task, I would go ask it. I'm consciously choosing to use my phone but noooooo can't have that. Currently GH has an alarm set for 2:30am even though I asked for 2:30 pm for my phone. So I have to hide in my house if I want to set something up on my phone b/c GH is the original buttinsky. Sheesh. I wonder if I can get GH to send that 2:30am alarm to the CEO of Google? Bet he'd like to hear it! The Google Assistant has choked on a lot of simple things. Like setting alarms. I had an error repeatedly telling me 'that time has already passed.' GA is nowhere near as robust as Siri. It needs a lot of work imo. 6. Uploading a 30 second video took a looooooong time for a phone with such a huge memory. That was disappointing. So it doesn't seem to be very fast. I've had it a week. Hopefully I'll get to know it better and the items above won't be a huge issue as I tend to keep my phones until they are dead.",3.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Google-G2PW210032GBBK-Unlocked-Smartphone-5-5-Inch/dp/B01M0PADR4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PZz7CQ9UL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01M0PADR4,429,201.48,0.0

10470,B01M0PADR4,The Scorpio Reviewer,4,14-Jan-17,False,A great phone for a pure android experence,I have had this phone a few days and i am very impressed with it. I did not get mine from Amazon but directly from Google. I was coming from an S6 that was unable to make it thru my day without needing to be put on the charger once or twice depending on my usage. I did some research before pulling the trigger between this and waiting for Samsung's next non-exploding phone. I decided to try pure android and i am glad i did. Here are some of my thoughts so far. Pros: 1. No other android phone comes close with how smooth and fluid it works. The pixel launcher is really good. Way better than Samsungs offering and i don't think i will need a 3rd part option like nova. 2. Battery life is amazing. I took it off the charger at 6am and at 2am once i went to bed i still had 30% left. 3. Does not feel too large. I am indifferent with big phones but this one feels the right size for me and does not feel massive. 4. Fingerprint scanner on the back is positioned perfectly and works really well. 5. This camera is really really good. I am used to shooting with a nikon dslr and while this will not replace that it probably really is the best camera in a cell phone all things considered but its not light years beyond what you get with a S7 or Iphone 7 but i feel it produces a better image. (I have compared to the S7 and the Iphone as other family members have them.) Cons: 1. Its expensive. The phone is great but you do pay for it being a Google phone. Personally i think it should be $100-$200 less for not having wireless charging (there is a way to add wireless charging inexpensively)or waterproofing. 2. Way too slick without a case. I was almost scared to use it until my case came. It feels real slippery until you put it in a case which with how much it cost I suggest you do as soon as possible. 3. No wireless charging or waterproofing. If these features are important to you they are not here unless you use some accessories. Overall i think its a great phone just know what you are getting going in. I will comment that everyone that sees it thinks its an Iphone until i tell them its not. The design is what it is. Not stunning nor poor. Very clean. As i said it does look like an Iphone. I will update this review as i use this phone more. One of my issues with Samsung phones over the years is how the performance degrades as it ages.

Here's what you need to know about it: - You have to choose Portrait mode manually for every picture with people in it, it's not automatic like in many other brands. - Image quality can be great, but for me at least it's only great about 50% of the time. The rest of the time, image quality varies greatly, and feels underwhelming mostly. - Panoramic images aren't very well processed (clearly shows the stitching points). - Low light camera is great - when using a tripod.

10016,B01LY3OB8D,AnonZero,5,13-Sep-18,True,"Best Pre-owned Phone Deal, Ever.","First I have to say that I'm extremely impressed with the service and product I recieved from GizmoTrader. The phone was in excellent condition as promised by the pics and when a small issue arose with the charger they sent me they immediately made things right by issuing a partial refund so that I could purchase another adapter asap. They're very consumer-friendly and they go the extra mile to take care of you. That being said, the Pixel XL itself is a wonderful device. If you have any reservations based on the fact that the phone is nearing two years old, they'll be dispelled once you get it in your hand. The screen is colorful and vibrant with deep blacks that only AMOLED can provide, the 3450mah battery delivers extended on- screen time, stock Android is snappy and responsive, updates come immediately, Android Pie is a nice upgrade over Oreo, 128GB of storage will last you a long time (I have 15 AAA mobile titles installed as well as over 8GB of music and I still have over 100GB remaining), the build quality is excellent and the semi-glass back helps radio reception a great deal. It has wifi calling, VoLTE, and so much more. And I haven't even addressed the camera yet. It's easily one of the best in the business. The Augmented Reality (AR) stickers allow you to place a 3D lifesize Stormtrooper in your livingroom and video him while he interacts with you and tracks your movements. You can put R2D2 in your bathroom, or Pogs in bed with you. It's amazing. You can customize stickers that look just like you and send them via MMS. But the camera; you have to research it for yourself, don't take my word for it. Sometimes I just take the Pixel out on family outings and leave my DSLR at home. It's especially impressive in low light situations where the HDR shines through. Add to that unlimited free cloud storage for all your photos and video, even 4K video. I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton of things about this phone but this review is a bit long already as it is. If you want a fast phone with the latest OS and a pro-level camera than grab the Pixel XL and don't look back. Then have fun chuckling to yourself when you see others with their overpriced Apple or Samsung devices that are still running last year's software.",36.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver),https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Phone-32GB/dp/B01LY3OB8D,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EfvRF3sHL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LY3OB8D,455,185.0,0.0

Went through the full setup, the phone upgraded to the latest version of Oreo, signed into my Google account, and found the phone wouldn't run Gmail or any Google app. Hard to believe, I know. As soon as any Google app tried to fire up, it closed down and the phone displayed the message ""Gmail has stopped,"" or ""Google has stopped."" Tried to contact support--you have a choice of chat or phone call, but either way the only way to do it is through a support app on the phone itself--and because it's a Google app, the phone wouldn't run it (actually, even worse, it let me wait in line, and then crashed when it was my turn). Searched online, and found there are lots of similar complaints for this phone (plus others I didn't even have a chance to encounter, like bad microphones, and more). Tried every trick in the book, including factory reset, updating and reinstalling apps, rolling back updates, clearing all data and cache--nothing helped.

But read the whole review before making any judgement. Pros. - The camera is the best in the market for normal usage. I say *normal usage* cause at the extremes (low light + filmy potraits + wide angles) iPhone 11pro is better. So, overally - Pixel 4 has the best camera. - Display with 90Hz is the best display out there. Period. - Software experience is amazing. Very clean and smooth. - Very fast and responsive. - Has some new features along with face unlock - it's not perfect by any means but it has potential. Cons. - This $1000 phone doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. Their sub $300 pixel 3a has it. *speechless* - 90Hz refresh rate is not permanent. It goes up and down depending on usage. - Camera cutout at the back is disgusting. But then, it's a personal preference. - No headphone jack and no microsd card slot. - With the forced 90Hz on, my potato has better battery life than this phone. So should you buy it? Yes, if you can get past the cons. Honestly, for some people the cons shouldn't be an issue. I mean we all carry chargers everywhere with us. And the rest shouldn't trouble the average users.

First thing I like to say is that there is no night-and-day difference between these two phones. The Pixel 2 has better functionality in most cases, but the Nexus 6P still hold up really well as is not outdated whatsoever. Last week, the 6P had its Android Oreo over-the-air software update. Well read on if you're on the fence. *Skipped out on Pixel 1 since it didn't have front facing speakers --Battery Life Pixel 2 wins this hands down, even better than the 6P when I got it out of the box at launch. Can last up to 1.5 to 2 days if you're conservative. Example: Typical 8 hour work day +1 hour commute (half hour to and from work) + 30min lunch break During commute non stop music. 80% volume Lunch 20-25mins on Youtube 15min breaks: some light mobile gaming, Two 2-3 minute phone calls Check e-mail text and notifications throughout the day Doing all of this. Starting from 100%, dropped down to 48% by the end of the day Super fast charging with included charger. Very similar to the Moto X Pure, but the batter life is way longer. Takes about an hour and a half to fully charge your phone from 10% --Camera Better stabilization/auto focus The auto focus on the 6P is horrible, even if you tap on the screen it will not focus accurately. On the Pixel 2 it auto focuses on an object for you without having to touch the screen and does a decent job at it too. 6P does a better job at capturing true real life colors especially in scenery. Pixel 2 makes everything more vibrant and seems like it auto photo-shops everything (which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Pixel 2 has way better front facing camera. Excellent for selfies as it auto blurs the background and do automatic lighting touch ups on your face.

Note that I don't have access to all high end phones such as iphone X, Note 8, HTC U11, LGV30 along others. --Finger Print Sensor Both very similar. Didn't notice a difference. Was able to detect 100% of the time with dry/clean fingers --Visual aesthetic, build quality Don't know about some people, but I love the camera visor hump on the 6P. Makes it look very futuristic and stands out from other phones. The Pixel 2 on the other hand, looks very generic and plain. The Pixel 2 does not have a streamline look like iphone x or Galaxy edge series as the screen not edge-to-edge. It has large bezels on the top and bottom which i don't really mind since I'm not accustomed to bezel-less screens, but i can see how some people are if they're used to it. Having bezels does have it's advantages as it's great for mobile games where you have to hold your phone horizontally Pixel 2 is also very lightweight. Even lighter than the Nexus 5 and feels very fragile. This is the only phone i bought a case for a week after purchase. Pixel 2 is dust and water resistant. Great for traveling, if you're an extrovert, or an adventurer with no arrows to the knee I don't like the side buttons. For the 6P the power button has this cross hatch metal texture design to it making it easily distinguishable from the volume rocker. For the Pixel 2, all the buttons feels the same, so it takes some time to get a feel for it Personal preference, but i like the 5inch display rather than the 6inch (thus one of my main reason for switching). 6inch is better for viewing cinematic movies/videos, but I already own a laptop and tablet and those tend to do a better job. I find a 5inch phone more portable and less finger travel when using --UI Android Oreo is very smooth. You will not notice a difference from the 6P with Android Oreo unless you compare them side by side. Pixel 2 is slightly faster, but only by milliseconds. Most of it probably have to do with finger travel from larger screen --Front facing speakers At first i assumed it would be muffled compared to the 6P due to the water and dust resistance, but it's surprisingly better than the 6P at higher volumes. At around 80% + volume there's much less distortion on the Pixel 2. Not to say that the 6P is bad, but once you hear the sound quality at near max volume from the Pixel 2 it's hard to go back. No headphone jack on the Pixel 2. So you have to resort to bluetooth for personalized music. This can be troublesome if you are an audiophile especially if you already own a expensive wired headset But if you are a true audiophile, and can afford it, i would get a dedicated mp3 player. Namely the Sony Walkmen brand It does come with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in box -Software update New android software first on Pixel 2 for 3 years instead of 2. 6P still have updates as mentioned before it updated to Andriod 8.0 last week I also own the Nexus 5 (phone released in 2013) and it still receives security updates from Google, but it stopped getting major software updates (stopped at Android 6.0.1) probably due to hardware limitations. Pixel 2 like other Google phones has no bloatware like ones you see on Samsung phones as is pure android -Active Edge At first i thought it was a throw away feature, but I find it quite useful overtime In the beginning i just used it to set alarms, but after a while starting using it for the Android Assistant. It's very similar to pressing on the google search bar, but much faster. Note that if your phone is off and you use the squeeze feature,you are automatically prompted to the lock screen. Exception being you have no passcode, you have trusted locations or trusted bluetooth devices active. Trusted faces also work, but it takes a second extra for it to boot up. When the phone is on, it's very intuitive, as it's easier to ask the assistant anything from directions and reminders on the fly. You can also squeeze to silence phone calls instead of pressing the volume rocker if you see a spam or phone number of a person you don't' have to talk to at the moment --Google Lens Google lens is similar to Amazon Firefly (on the Amazon phone that no one uses?). It's better at picking up words, number and text than objects -Always on Display/ ""Now Playing"" Out of the box, the Pixel 2 has an always on display showing the time/date, and app icon notification. You can go to settings and turn this off if you want to save battery life. If you have it off, you can easily access it by double tapping on the screen. Always on display is great when you're sleeping and as you can glace over to look if you have it on a smartphone stand on the nightstand Pixel 2 has a ""Now Playing"" feature which auto detects music playing in the background with is great as you don't have to ask google assistant for it or use a 3rd party app like Sound Hound. Song has to play in background for 10-20secs in most cases before it's able to display on your phone depending on how loud, clear and popular the song is. --Transfer Process Easy to transfer data use included adapter. If you own an android phone, all apps will transfer over, you just need to re-enter some passwords if it's not connected directly to your google account. You can also transfer iphone data over but it's only contacts, and photos ----Overall a good upgrade if you like the enhanced features. 6P is still a good phone and is not outdated in terms of software and hardware. If you find the upgraded/new features on the Pixel 2 enticing then it's a good upgrade.

I find a 5inch phone more portable and less finger travel when using --UI Android Oreo is very smooth. You will not notice a difference from the 6P with Android Oreo unless you compare them side by side. Pixel 2 is slightly faster, but only by milliseconds. Most of it probably have to do with finger travel from larger screen --Front facing speakers At first i assumed it would be muffled compared to the 6P due to the water and dust resistance, but it's surprisingly better than the 6P at higher volumes. At around 80% + volume there's much less distortion on the Pixel 2. Not to say that the 6P is bad, but once you hear the sound quality at near max volume from the Pixel 2 it's hard to go back. No headphone jack on the Pixel 2. So you have to resort to bluetooth for personalized music. This can be troublesome if you are an audiophile especially if you already own a expensive wired headset But if you are a true audiophile, and can afford it, i would get a dedicated mp3 player. Namely the Sony Walkmen brand It does come with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in box -Software update New android software first on Pixel 2 for 3 years instead of 2. 6P still have updates as mentioned before it updated to Andriod 8.0 last week I also own the Nexus 5 (phone released in 2013) and it still receives security updates from Google, but it stopped getting major software updates (stopped at Android 6.0.1) probably due to hardware limitations. Pixel 2 like other Google phones has no bloatware like ones you see on Samsung phones as is pure android -Active Edge At first i thought it was a throw away feature, but I find it quite useful overtime In the beginning i just used it to set alarms, but after a while starting using it for the Android Assistant. It's very similar to pressing on the google search bar, but much faster. Note that if your phone is off and you use the squeeze feature,you are automatically prompted to the lock screen. Exception being you have no passcode, you have trusted locations or trusted bluetooth devices active. Trusted faces also work, but it takes a second extra for it to boot up. When the phone is on, it's very intuitive, as it's easier to ask the assistant anything from directions and reminders on the fly. You can also squeeze to silence phone calls instead of pressing the volume rocker if you see a spam or phone number of a person you don't' have to talk to at the moment --Google Lens Google lens is similar to Amazon Firefly (on the Amazon phone that no one uses?). It's better at picking up words, number and text than objects -Always on Display/ ""Now Playing"" Out of the box, the Pixel 2 has an always on display showing the time/date, and app icon notification. You can go to settings and turn this off if you want to save battery life. If you have it off, you can easily access it by double tapping on the screen. Always on display is great when you're sleeping and as you can glace over to look if you have it on a smartphone stand on the nightstand Pixel 2 has a ""Now Playing"" feature which auto detects music playing in the background with is great as you don't have to ask google assistant for it or use a 3rd party app like Sound Hound. Song has to play in background for 10-20secs in most cases before it's able to display on your phone depending on how loud, clear and popular the song is. --Transfer Process Easy to transfer data use included adapter. If you own an android phone, all apps will transfer over, you just need to re-enter some passwords if it's not connected directly to your google account. You can also transfer iphone data over but it's only contacts, and photos ----Overall a good upgrade if you like the enhanced features. 6P is still a good phone and is not outdated in terms of software and hardware. If you find the upgraded/new features on the Pixel 2 enticing then it's a good upgrade.

I bought the phone in white. It still looks good, but it's color highlighted much of the wear this phone has accrued in its time; the most obvious being the hairline cracks in the weak points of the phone. I bought a hard case for it anyway so I am not too concerned. The cameras were in perfect condition and the screen showed no signs of scratching, although there's extremely minute burn-in on parts of the screen where you'd expect it to be. You don't notice it unless you're really looking hard for it. Generic packaging was ok, but didn't have any bubble wrap on the phone itself. It came with a charger + usbc cable, the sim card tool was a nice touch, but slightly disappointed that It was missing the usbc-to-headphone jack.

26826,B07YMNLXL3,Serge,5,13-Dec-19,True,Finally went pure android and don't regret it,"For years with my phones I have always gone with the idea of ""Hardware over software"" because of the fact that software can be changed and updated, but hardware cannot. As a result, I stuck mainly with Samsung and oneplus phones (most recently the note 9). This year, I finally took the plunge on the Pixel, because I felt like the hardware was finally good enough to just scrape by (more than 4 gigs of ram is nice, 90hz screen is great, and the camera makes me feel like a professional). Its been almost a month, and I don't regret it at all. The experience is wildly better when there is no bloatware or extra stuff to get through. I didn't have to disable a hardware dedicated button to a function I never used, disable apks, and change all the default apps. If you are one that does not value the software experience, though, I feel like there are a lot of other phones that you should get instead. If you cannot get it on sale like I did, then I do not think what you get is worth the price. But now that I have experienced it, I don't know if I can ever go back to other android phones, save for OnePlus, if their cameras ever catch up.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

17778,B079C1K282,Robert E. Daniels Jr.,5,13-Aug-19,True,Pure Perfect!!!,"My old phone was on life support, I needed something cheap and fast to arrive. This arrived next day, about that...the delivery person DELIVERED TO THE WRONG APARTMENT. The address wasn't even close. Luckily, I was able to identify the apartment from the photo he took and I was able to retrieve it from the doorstep, luckily no one was home....I knocked several times to inform them, that this was my package. Anyway, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! First, if it's a renewed phone, I can't tell, the phone came in pristine condition like new, not a scratch or blemish on it. Phone came with USB-C charger, USB to USB-C adapter which made transferring my data a snap. I just plugged the cable into my old phone following the directions on the Pixel, it did the rest in less than 15 minutes. All of my apps from the Play Store installed as soon as I logged in with my gmail account. One slight snafu, I actually had two gmail addresses added to my old phone, so I had to add both accounts to retrieve all of my contacts and photos. Phone also came with USB-C to 3.5 headphone jack adapter, very nice as some reviews reported not getting hardly anything. The only thing that I did not receive was the little SIM too to insert my SIM card... a paper clip did the trick. One thing to note if you're like me, I had the same phone for close to seven years, so I had the larger SIM, if you have the larger SIM, you'll need to go to your carrier and request a new one, mine cost me $8 for the smaller one. I was told by the rep that you can cut them, found this....you're welcome: https://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Nano-Micro-Nano-Standard-Micro-Standard-Cellphones/dp/B009P16FKY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=SIM+Card+cutter&qid=1565720397&s=gateway&sr=8-3 The Pixel 2XL is outstanding and it's packed with so many cool features that I'll leave you to do your own homework but everything they say about this phone is true. Camera is awesome, the notification screen, the song identification, Google Assistance is BADASS, the squeeze to bring up GA is way awesome. You'll see people peeking at it when you use it...lol. Oh and it's FAST, for me this was a huge step up coming from an Old Samsung Note 3, which I gave a proper burial in my junk drawer, it served me well, so I may be slightly skewed. I can say however, the software truly shines and I have so much control over how things look and behave. The fingerprint reader is flawless. I added both index fingers and the reader not only unlocks the phone but integrates with other secure apps like my banking app and portal to my apartment. The phone is frequently updated, about three a week...which is awesome. Battery life is very good, I can go all day on a charge, that does not include screen on constant play time but reasonable use. I no longer have to lug around a portable battery The one pet peeve I have is, this sucker is thin!! So thin, it's difficulty to pick up from a table. It's a solid phone with a little weight to it, so I'm thinking, how long before I drop this puppy? I got a case immediately, I ordered this one because I didn't want to cover up the phone but add some protection without bulking it up too much. This was perfect flexible and doesn't add bulk or weight, just enough to hang on a little better. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747813GV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Screen is beautiful. Probably my favorite feature is the call screen which allows you to screen calls. When someone or something calls you, you can hit ""Screen Call"" and your phone will basically say, ""What do you want, they don't want to talk to you, say who you are, what you want and they may decide to talk to you"" when they talk you will see their message transcribed with a choice to accept or deny...BRILLIANT!!!

It is not perfect but it does its job very well. Here is a breakdown of what I can say positive and negative about the phone . Pros: Great Battery Life (better than the iphone x and the note 8) Great Camera (Best Camera I've seen in a smartphone. Period. ) Great OS (Lots of customization and No Bloatware like other Androids) Gets the updates faster than anyone else. 2 Year Warranty out of the box (No need to worry if the screen has burn or other problems after owning the device for a year) Front Speakers (Super Loud ) USB Type C (very common with flagship phones out there . Great thing they included the transfer cable to transfer all your pictures from your iphone to this device) Fingerprint reader ( Very Responsive and great placement ) Large Screen IP67 certification (better than nothing, similar rating to the iphone X) Unlimited Google Cloud Storage for 2 years (Original Quality) Makes up for not having the expandable storage. VR Ready with your google daydream Cons: No Wireless Charging Screen looks great but viewing angles are horrible Blue Tint precense ( gets better when you change the display setting to Saturated but there are better looking screens out there) No IP68 certification Expensive ( you can get it cheaper with a carrier or getting it online from a third party) No expandable Storage (you have 64gb and 128gb options , the bigger options goes for an additional $100) Ouch! Would I recommend this over the iphone X or the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy Note 8 ? Yes.

10389,B01M0PADR4,Jim Wright,4,12-Sep-18,True,Bluetooth a bit glitchy; otherwise terrific,"I've had this for several weeks now. Pros: the price is hard to beat. Compatible with Android Pie (9). Camera is fast and takes terrific pictures. Its successor has some nice upgrades, but getting a still-supported flagship phone for a midrange price was a worthwhile compromise. For a refurbished device, it was physically flawless. The only clue it wasn't new was the packaging - safe and durable, but not the original, fancy box. Cons: *the Bluetooth can be flaky. an incoming phone call frequently kills the connection with bluetooth headsets or car audio. I often have to reboot the phone and power cycle the headset to reestablish a working connection. Some headsets seem to work a bit better (Beats) than others (generic buds on sale) but I've had more problems with every bluetooth headset than i've had with any previous phone. * The phone gets very hot when running VR (google cardboard) apps. Bottom line: For $300 I got a phone that feels like a flagship. It may not be the king of 2018 or even 2017, but I upgraded from the 2017 ""midrange flagship"" from Motorola and there are very few areas where I felt like I stepped backwards.

It was just slightly more expensive than the one I returned but much to my surprise, the one I received was BRAND NEW in a sealed Original Google Pixel box with all the cables and documents - which my original refurb did not come with. Everything works great and the whole process of restoring my content from my original Pixel XL to my new one was painless due to the built in backup process that the Pixels have. So, even for an older phone, the Pixel XL is still a great phone. Battery life is stellar, and seems to have improved with the latest version of android ""Pie"". Features are great and the camera is still better than most. I had a LG V20 on Verizon but switched to Project Fi, so it wouldn't work.

It seems like the bad data connection was the reason this phone was returned. I am usually in an environment where I have access to wifi so it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and that is why it took me a long time to realize the problem, but It is definitely a significant one. The camera is very good quality but there's something wrong with the display of the phone. Compared to my last phone (Moto G5 Plus) the display quality seems low, not in resolution (of course) but in colors. The phone seems to have a light but permanent orange tint in its display, no matter what I do with the display settings. I have compared the display with all of my other laptops, monitors, tv, and older phones with same pictures. So, buyers be careful. You might end up with a good phone or really crappy ones.

Cons: Build quality. My first two Pixels had failed light sensors. Instead of blanking the screen when I held the phone to my ear, the screen would go blank when a call came in or when I dialed out. Even multiple factory resets would not fix the issue. The phone overheats and struggles to remember Bluetooth devices. Support. The idea of instant chat straight from the Help tab sounds great. In practice it is very tedious. Set aside an hour if you use it. Incompatibility with Smart TVs. You cannot mirror your screen like you can with Apple and Samsung products.

Amazing, sometimes I go into day 3 before I need to charge again and I am a pretty heavy phone user, web services mainly. If you stream movies, it will be less so, but still much better than an older phone. The camera seems sharper than my previous Pixel XL. The WiFi is A LOT better than the Pixel XL's, which has a huge known bug in the 2.4 GHz bands. So nice to have a phone again that does not have that bug. Also, this phone will support Android Q and maybe its successor, so it's a bit future proof. The display is also quite good. The only thing missing is a headphone jack, but I am being assimilated. Once wireless charging is everywhere, there will probably be no holes in phones at all and they will be waterproof, so that's just one step closer to that future I guess.

I play games and use the phone all day and am at around 40 to 50% when I go to bed, so for me the XL is sufficient but I would assume the smaller version battery would be an issue. All in all, great phone. Buy it when it is discounted, get the XL to avoid battery issues and you'll be happy. One last little con is that Google didn't include headphones. For a flagship phone that costs this much, they could/should have included headphones or at least an adapter given this doesn't, like most new phones, have a headphone jack.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Just-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C9GrXEp4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YMNLXL3,241,668.8,799.0

One thing: it does come with a generic charger and USB-C cable, which I don't trust. I mean the charger is fine...but I've only ever used an Anker cable with it. I can't say for sure, but I suspect maybe some of the reviewers who have had motherboard failures and such might be the victims of bad USB-C cables. I've read articles about how a bad USB-C cable can fry a device. I saw a spreadsheet a while back, put together by an engineer working for Google, reviewing reliable cables. I think he had a very expensive tablet or phone get fried by a generic, and that was his inspiration for doing the reviews.

15917,B0766TPHSH,chris stoltz,4,11-Feb-18,False,Review of the Google Pixel 2 XL,"I have been using the Google Pixel 2 XL every day for over two months. It is by far the best phone I have used. I will lay out the pros and cons in this review to help you make your decision on whether to purchase this phone. Pros Battery Life - Routinely lasts all day with over 50% remaining, which means that even if you forget to charge up overnight, it will last most of the next day with regular use. Speakers - The Pixel 2 XL features dual front-facing stereo speakers. They provide a fantastic experience while listening to music or watching videos. Camera - The Camera on this phone is one if its biggest selling points. The rear camera is a 12.2 MP sensor with dual LED flash and OIS (optical image stabilization). It is capable of video capture of 2160p at 30fps or 1080p at 120,60, or 30 fps. The front facing camera is an 8 MP sensor capable of 1080p video. The performance in any lighting condition is unmatched by any other flagship smartphone. UI - One of the biggest advantages to owning the Pixel 2 XL is a that it is a Google phone, so you get pure Android with updates as soon as they are published by Google. Cons Audio - The biggest issue with this phone is the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack. This means you will have to rely on the included USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. It is an inconvenience at times and does make it impossible to charge the phone and use wired headphones simultaneously. Screen - The Pixel 2 XL has a 6” P-OLED display at a resolution of 1440x2880 with a pixel density of 538 ppi (pixels per inch). Under most conditions the screen is fantastic, with settings to change the saturation to your liking. The issue is a noticeable blue-shift when viewed at extreme viewing angles that you are unlikely to encounter during regular use. Conclusion The Google Pixel 2 XL is a great phone with enough pros to outweigh the cons. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for an upgrade. Even iPhone users should consider the Pixel if they are interested in Android. While I can’t make any decisions for you, I hope this review helped make that decision easier.",206.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black,https://www.amazon.com/Google-Unlocked-Octa-Core-12-2MP-Camera/dp/B0766TPHSH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dXcgzgqkL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0766TPHSH,153,409.88,0.0

I haven't realized how bad experience we have on Samsung Android version because the way they kill apps while in background. THey have been doing this since Android 6 and most of the apps doesn't work as they should be. Also, I am pretty sure after a year of owning your phone or Samsung or T-mobile send an update to make it unusable.

21111,B07HKPMFZ5,joseph knight,5,11-Aug-19,True,AN ABSOLUTE BEAST OF A PHONE!,"Truly the BEST phone I have ever used! This is coming from a person who was burned...(TWICE)... by Google and the Pixel 1's faulty microphone. However I'm a forgiving kind of guy and man am I glad I got over my first experience with Pixel devices and ordered this one! Ok, so what's so good about this phone, huh? EVERYTHING! The phone is super fast and snappy with any APP I use. I'm a heavy gamer and this phone has been able to easily play any games IV thrown at it. Plus they look amazing with the screen in this phone. The OLED screen is such a treat for my eyes. Deep, rich, and vibrant...I love watching movies with it! And I know you've all heard about the ""hideously huge notch"" and how it just ruins everything..... Well, I barely notice it. In fact there are some neat apps that can do some really cool things with the notch like putting a color changing strip around it that will work as notification alert or battery bar. And that leads perfectly to the next great thing, the battery. I am a very heavy user and the battery will last me almost the entire day. The speed charger is blazingly fast so if I should have to plug it in before the days up, it only takes about 10-15 mins to get 25-30%. Then there's the fact that Pixel users get all the updates first. I love rubbing that in Samsung users faces! Let's see....what am I forgetting..... Ahhh yes, saved the best for last. The camera. There aren't words to describe how damn good the camera really is. I still can't believe a cellphone can take pictures like this. Blows my mind. It has actually inspired me to take up photography as a hobby. Not to mention Google will backup and store an UNLIMITED amount of photos and videos for FREE! Yeah, yeah, I know I sound like Googles little fanboy. Hell I admit I am. No shame here! Just go ahead and get this phone and I promise you'll be a fanboy/fangirl too! Theres alot of other great features to this phone that I haven't mentioned so I guess you'll just have to get one and see for yourselves. Trust me you won't regret it! Oh yea, I did buy mine refurbished and it looked like new. Not a scratch on it. the only difference was it came without the original charger. But it refurbed and save yourself few bucks.

10532,B01M0PADR4,RGG,1,10-Oct-18,True,"Sold as new, but wasn't","My wife and I have Pixels, so we've purchased two new ones. On top of that, her first pixel had to be sent back and they sent us a brand new one to replace it, so I'm very familiar with the packaging. First hint I didn't have a new phone, I had a charger cable and connector, but the original phones actually came with two cables (one USB-C to USB-C, and one regular USB to USB-C). This only came with one set. Oh, well, I thought, maybe they changed to this a bit later. Second hint, the little tool to remove the SIMM card tray wasn't in the little booklet like the other phones I had opened before. It was at the bottom of the box where the charger cable was. Hmm, again looked suspicious. I gave the phone a quick look to see if it was used. It looked pretty clean, but I didn't look that hard. I set it up and started using it. Ran out of battery halfway through my day. This was definitely not right, as I could get a day and a half of heavy use off my first pixel when it was new. It barely beat out the batter life of the currently 2 year old pixel I'm trying to replace. This was not a new battery at all. So I looked at the phone a bit more closely. The microphone ports were super clean, looked good. But then I found some tiny, tiny scratches on the back and a small scuff on one edge (I put a cover on it as soon as I opened it, literally) when I looked more discriminately. No way this is a new phone. I went back home and opened one of the original pixel boxes we first purchased. The tool to open the SIM tray is definitely different, and the tool in the impostor phone box didn't fit into the cutouts inside the booklet that comes with the phone, which is why they just left it at the bottom of the box. I will be returning it for a refund. It looks like the order was sent by Abe's even though it says Google by the product name. I'll never buy from Abe's again. I'm looking for another place to buy a first gen pixel, as the ones made after January shouldn't have the microphone issue, and with the third generation coming out, they are pretty cheap now.

10121,B01LY3OB8D,S. Chung,5,10-Nov-16,False,The best Android phone on the market,"I was lucky enough to get a pre-order of the Pixel XL phone in as soon as it was announced by Google. In a nutshell, it is the best Android phone on the market today (Nov 2016). I have owned a Pixel XL, a Nexus 6P, and an iPhone 6S+, and I would rate them in that order (Pixel first, iPhone last). The hardware across all three seem comparable. The Pixel XL is noticeably lighter than the Nexus 6P, and it’s a little faster. But all three are pretty close in terms of performance. The big differentiator is the software. The Pixel XL comes with the latest version of Android N, with Google Assistant fully integrated. Nexus is also great and you can install the Google Assistant. The iPhone 6S+ is a distant third - iOS has gotten harder to use over the years and Siri just plain sucks. The Google Assistant has become my goto action on the phone, and it’s 100x better than Siri. Even though companies like Samsung also make good hardware, they just have to load up their phones with a ton of bloatware which is nearly impossible to get rid of. The very nice thing about “made by Google” phones is that it comes with the default stock Android operating system without all the additional bloatware that other phone makers add to theirs. Google also keeps it phones always up to date with the latest version of Android, whereas with other phone makers they often choose not to upgrade because it’s a lot of effort for them. So, the Pixel XL is the latest of the “made by Google” phones, and it is by far the best Android smartphone out there. Amazon doesn’t carry the Pixel phone - in fact Amazon won’t carry a lot of the “made by Google” products because Amazon considers Google a competitor (Google’s Home product competes with Amazon’s Echo, the Nexus tablet competes with the Kindle, etc.). So as of Nov 2016 you won’t find this phone on Amazon, with the exception that some smaller less-than-reputable companies pre-ordered a number of phones from Google and are now selling through Amazon with an exorbitant markup (~2x the retail price due to the high demand and short supply of these phones). I purchased my Pixel XL on the google store (store.google.com) at retail for $750+tax USD, that’s probably where you should go if you’re looking to buy one of these. Many of the reviews for the Pixel XL on Amazon are negative mainly in response to the price-gouging by the smaller resellers, you can ignore those because those reviews have nothing to do with the phone itself (they’re more directed at the companies trying to take consumers for a ride). So what do I like about the Pixel? - It’s fast and responsive, much like the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+. - Like the Nexus 6P, the fingerprint scanner is really fast and responsive, and placed in a MUCH better spot than the iPhone 6S+. It’s where the index finger naturally sits. - I really like the latest Android N software, and I really really like the integrated Google Assistant. - The external reviews made a big deal about the camera - after using it some I have to say it's quite good, even better than the iPhone 6S+ which I thought was already great for a phone camera. The phone is *much* faster than the Nexus 6P phone (meaning it takes the photo when you tap, not 1 second later), and takes excellent pictures in low light. - The camera app has gotten a lot better - the video recording now has a pause feature, and you can take 4K video! - Battery life is excellent, but again not much difference from the other two (which were also very good). - Like the Nexus 6P, this phone uses a USB-C charger, which means it charges very quickly. I don't have to charge overnight any more, plugging in once in a while keeps the battery mostly full all the time. - Google keeps its phones always up to date with the latest updates, much like Apple does with its iPhone. What don't I like about the Pixel XL? - The Nexus 6P had stereo speakers (one speaker on the bottom and one on top), whereas the Pixel has speakers only at the bottom. It's not bad, but you don’t get the same stereo effect as you did on the Nexus 6P. - Like the Nexus 6P, the volume buttons are pretty far down on the side, which makes it hard to use some hands-free car cradles that want to squeeze both sides of the phone without errantly changing your volume for you. - Like both the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+, sometimes when you take photos while capturing video you get a slight glitch in the video where you snapped the photo. C’mon Google, you should be able to fix that! - It doesn't have a micro-SD slot, you're stuck w. the storage the phone comes with. My overall recommendation is to buy this phone, it is the best out there. Right now you can get it through Verizon, or if you want to purchase the unlocked version you have to buy it from the google store. However, it’s expensive (similar cost to an iPhone). If you want a very similar made by Google phone at about half the price (since it’s a year older), I would also strongly recommend the Nexus 6P. It’s very similar to the Pixel XL, just a little heavier but it will get the latest Android N and the Google Assistant.

I tried to contact LEX DEALHOUSE and they responded to ask if the phone had any damage. I responded right back: no. Since then--over a week ago--neither Amazon nor LEX DEALHOUSE has answered back.

17246,B0787V183F,Amazon Customer,5,10-May-18,True,Received a great device in mint condition,"Since my 2 year old Nexus 5x finally hit the dreaded bootloop issue and I needed a phone faster than LG would turn around a warranty replacement, I found myself in the market for a new phone. Being a Project Fi subscriber, this pretty much narrowed down my choices to the Moto 4x or a Pixel 2 phone. I ruled out the 4x because I've had bad experiences when it comes to Android software updates for non-Google Android phones in the past. Unfortunately the Pixel phones are significantly more expensive than the Nexus phones used to be, hence the decision to go refurbished. I ended up ordering a ""Kinda Blue"" Pixel 2 (64GB) from Kanga Supply. The phone shipped quickly and arrived on time via UPS. This was critical for me since I needed the replacement phone to arrive before going on a trip. The vendor had sent the phone requiring signature confirmation, which I appreciate. The phone arrived in a generic white box but was very well packaged, with peel-off protection on the screen. The device I received was in mint condition. The phone proved to be fully functional and arrived running Oreo 8.0. I did notice a faint clicking noise about twice a second in a test call, which is a known issue with the Pixel 2 phones that was fixed by Google in a software update. The problem went away after I let the phone apply all the pending software updates. -- Also the phone that I received seems to have been a Verizon one, and not a Google one, since the ""OEM Unlocking"" option under ""Developer Options"" is greyed out, which would indicate a locked bootloader. -- However the phone is NOT SIM locked and it activated on Project Fi without a hitch. Also for giggles, the box that the phone came in listed the color as ""Verizon Blue"". -- If you care about an unlocked bootloader you might want to avoid the ""Kinda Blue"" variant of the Pixel 2, since this color was a Verizon exclusive for a few months, so I guess there's a higher chance of receiving a phone that was initially sold through Verizon/has a locked bootloader. In terms of accessories, the phone was bundled with a generic USB A charger that was marked ""5V, 2.1A"" and a USB A to USB C cable. I confirmed that I could charge the phone with the supplied charger and cable, but the charger/cable combo would NOT do rapid charging. --- Again not a big deal for me since the phone was ""Charging rapidly"" using the old charger and cable I used to use with my Nexus 5x. Also I did NOT receive any other accessories with the phone, such as the USB C to headphone adapter or any kind of written documentation. But this was mentioned in the listing and I didn't expect anything else. Summarizing, I am happy with the service I received from Kanga Supply and with the device itself. Would recommend the Pixel 2 as well as Kanga. EDIT: What I mistook for small blemishes around the edges of the phone is actually a design feature, as confirmed by closely looking at online images of Pixel 2 phones.

I can not find a scratch on it and it appears to be working great after we installed our TING CDMA Sim card and configured it. I am a little disappointed that it came with a very slow generic USB charger and no other accessories....not even a SIM card ejection tool for example. The seller should note that in the description. Now we have to order a fast charger and USB to headphone jack. If the phone lasts a while it will still be a good purchase for the money.

Checked the battery info and said it’s last charge was over 83 days ago, so it’s been quite some time since it’s been used. I’m pretty certain the unit I got was hardly used to begin with from the previous owner. USB-C cable, charging brick, SIM injector, audio dongle, and USB adapter were all included as described in great condition, no damage from what I could tell. I know other users have expressed that their devices came mildly damaged or with some scratches here and there, so take my experience with a grain of salt.

15991,B0767538YH,D.Z,1,1-May-18,True,"Charge port failed after two months, google refuses to replace due to large scratch on back","Negatives: The USB-C charge port gradually started failing. Then it refused to charge at all via power devliery (thats what the official ac adapter it comes with uses to charge quickly). So, I plugged it into a regular usb port and it would charge from there. Then a few days later it wouldnt charge and I smelled a burning smell coming from the usbc port. It was connected to a regular usb port, which had no problem charging any of my other devices perfectly and reliably and it was an anker product not some weird chinese deal. From that point on I havent been able to charge the phone. I contacted google for warranty replacement, they requested pictures of front and back of phone. Since I had dropped the phone before there was a ding near the top of the phone (was TOTALLY unrelated to the charging issues). Google support said that since there appeared to be a tiny crack, not just a ding, that it was no longer covered under warranty and that I was SOL. I bought this phone along with the pixelbook, whose trackpad failed within a month of purchase (see that review). I have tons of gadgets and I dont remember having ANY hardware failures ever! DO NOT BUY GOOGLE HARDWARE the quality control is awful and they have silly excuses ready to get out of warranty replacement. (again see my pixelbook review). I also got the pixelbuds, another crappy product. (Exception: Google Wifi was actually a great product, best router ever- go figure.) So after two months I have a really expensive brick that cannot be charged. Other issues I had: From day one I was never able to easily get multiple large files off the device, not sure if that is a software or hardware issue. It would fail during the process of copying files to any type of usb c drive or memory card reader (tried several). So getting large video files off the device was a painstaking process of copying a few at a time, waiting for those to complete, then copying a few more. I even tried copying using a chormebook connected to phone via usb c and that copying process would also sometimes fail. Since google refuses to include micro sd cards, that option for file transfer is also gone. Battery life was about standard for current phones, definitely wouldnt leave the house without a charger. (On the other hand, the keyone black edition Im using now I dont even think about bringing a charger, even I have trouble running that battery all the way down in a day of heavy usage). When used with a daydream headset to watch videos, after about an hour or two the phone would get too hot and I would be requested by daydream notifications to stop using vr mode while the phone cools down. So as a video watching device with daydream, the product fails.(Eagerly awaiting the Oculus Go) The navigation buttons use unnecessary screen real estate with no official option to hide or turn off or replace with gestures, although I read there is a work around, but I didnt want any issues so I didnt use the workaround. Huawei and Samsung phones don't waste screen space with unneeded onscreen buttons. Positives: The phone works with Project FI. That is the main reason I got the phone. Project Fi is fantastic, especially for travelers. Fortunately, I can stay on the project Fi plan and keep using data only sims in reliable phones even with a dead pixel 2 XL brick. (Although I dont seem to be able to forward calls to non U.S. numbers, which is a bummer when traveling, especially when the phone itself is broken) Super smooth performance and stock google, best camera ever, all apps work really well on it.

17722,B079C1K282,Tyler Brooks,3,1-Jan-19,True,Great value for a quality phone,"I have been shopping for a budget android phone for a few months and couldn't get happy with any of the options. (nokia 6.1/7.1 are probably the best) So I saw a pixel 2 xl refurb for $390 it really caught my attention. The conclusion i am debating is is it worth 3 or 4 stars The pros: For under 400 dollars i have a pixel 2 xl that is very quick, no lag at all and i will almost certainly use it for the next year or 2 (or 3 if it continues to get updates from google) the phone works exactly like you would expect a pixel 2 xl too. In addition, I just figured out that i actually got a google model and not a verizon one The cons: there are 3-4 pretty good knicks around the rim of the phone Also the sim tray has some paint chipped off. Also there are quite a few minor scratches around the screen, they are nearly imperceptible without a flashlight shining directly on it though. Lastly, there are ""minimal to no signs of wear on the back of the phone"" like in the phones description. It is too bad the entirety of the phone can't claim that. My biggest issue though is the battery, after running accubattery for a few days it calculates i have 80-90 % battery health. It is really disappointing that they don't put in a new battery when they ""refurbish"" these things. Also as many reviews have said the grills weren't cleaned. So yea those 2 things each get a star knocked off: Battery and small chips I have read a majority of the reviews on this page This listing might be more accurate to say you are buying a used phone and not a refurbished phone. As such, if you happen to get a gently used phone it is great and if you get a used phone in bad condition that would lead to the high number of negative reviews Overall though, I would say i am pleased, If you have used a sub par phone for any length of time, like a couple months as i had, getting back to a phone like this that is snappy, updated and full of features is a godsend and for under $400.

17641,B0799ZMY6D,matt law,5,1-Feb-19,True,Really looked new,"I've bought several refurbished phones in the past including a pixel xl for my wife. This phone was by far the best condition of all the phones I have received. There was no damage at all and the device was very clean. Looked brand new, and I don't say that lightly. The ports have all been throughly cleaned and the battery appears to be new, according to several apps I used to test it. Based off some reviews it appears I was rather fortunate, that said I received a very high quality phone, so they do exist. I am not reviewing the phone as much as I am reviewing its refurbishment. I am sure that you know what makes a pixel good and it's why you are considering a refurb. Pros: -Very Clean -New(ish) battery (can't confirm definitively) but the apps are marking it as 100% -No scratches or visible wear and tear. Cons: - As stated everything the phone comes with is generic, and the charger I received is not a fast charger. - It does not come with a headphone usb-c converter that a stock new one comes with, but that is also listed in the summary, it would just be nice if it did. Summary Like I said I have purchased a lot of refurb in the past and this is the best I've ever received. That is not everyone's experience and I can only speak for myself.
