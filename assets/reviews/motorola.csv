14717,B072ZWCKP5,C. Appel,4,9-Sep-17,False,Great battery life and camera,"A gift from my husband when my Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge broke. We put quite a lot of thought into which phone to get. It's nice that there are so many options for unlocked cell phones. Easy to use, great sound quality, connects to internet easily. We also appreciate the lovely quality of photographs it takes in all sorts of light. Also, it's nice that you can use just about any carrier since it can use GSM or CDMS. In the end it is cheaper than it would have cost me to make use of the insurance on my phone. I will be buying this sort of phone from here on in, no more $700 phones for me! Edit: 10/29/2018. The phone last over a year. 13 months to be exact. It got glitchy at the 11 month mark. All down hill from there. Couldn't even play games on it witihout it refusing to accept calls coming in.

14557,B072ZWCKP5,SickSix,5,9-Oct-17,True,A $200 Nexus/Pixel that only needs charged twice a week.,"I just recently bought this phone for myself and my girlfriend; one E4 Plus in each color. I recently ""downgraded"" from a G4 Plus, only for battery longevity. My girlfriend needed a replacement for her continually degrading battery in her Galaxy S5. So far, performance has been great, although it is far from being a powerhouse flagship level device. Mobile ""gamers"" will be disappointed, social media junkies and people who use their phones for work will be pleased with the power trade-off for battery life. Personally, I have 2 games installed on my E4 Plus: Star Wars KOTOR and GTA San Andreas - these are far from intensive games, but do suffer from dropped frames in heavy NPC concentrations or when driving. GTA is best played at low settings, no shadows or reflections; KOTOR will lag - explosions will do you no favors for framerates. The screen, while ""only"" 720p is crisp and clear, colors are well balanced and represented, however you will note that this screen is even outclassed by the iPhone 5S/SE and not comparable to OLED/AMOLED displays. It's good for what it is. Videos on YouTube play just fine, pictures are well represented, and you can see your icons in the app drawer without issue. I have not experienced any washout or fading at off-angles on mine. I honestly can't tell the difference between this screen and the G4 Plus'. The camera is your average shooter; you need good lighting for decent shots, low light results in noise and loss of detail. Good lighting = good pictures I have yet to put a dent in this battery as of yet. I've had about 3 hours of screen on time and have just dropped to 87% charge, with an estimated up time of 4 more days, however your mileage may vary. 5000maH is going to last a lot longer than the batteries on your flagships, especially when paired with such a power-sipping chipset. I look forward to only charging my phone once or twice a work week. Performance is also due to the near stock Android OS that is installed. Aside from a few Moto apps, you essentially have a $200 Nexus/Pixel. Stock Android paired with the Snapdragon 427 (bottom bin part) and 2GB of RAM; you'll be hard-pressed to find better performance with these specs and a manufacturer modified OS. Pros: cheap, giant battery, good performance (just don't expect to do much gaming), big clear screen, near bone-stock Android Cons: cost is a little on the high side but you're paying for a giant battery, screen is not full HD and those of you that hold your phones 4 inches from your face will see pixels (at 10-14 inches away, at a normal use distance, you won't), somewhat slow when multiple apps are running (ads will lag your apps for a few seconds at times). Over all: This is the best phone for the money. You're getting nearly stock Android 7.1.1, a big 5.5 inch screen, and a device that should only need charged a couple of times per week.",100.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

The ICS is fun, the Processor is extremely fast, the camera is clear (albeit a slow shutter speed) and the build, fit and finish are amazing. The best part about this phone is you get all the same or better features in this phone as you do in the larger Moto Droid Devices, without having to stretch your paws out to access it all. The ""edge-to-edge"" display is great, with a small bezel it really makes the phone feel much larger to your eyes, while staying small in your hands. I know the great moto build quality will last the 2 years I will be with this phone, as the strong aluminum bezel, tough Kevlar backing (yes, yes, I know its just martketing tactics, but it feels cool) gorilla glass, and weather-resistant coating all work hand in hand to provide a steady, strong and durable device. If you hate the massive size devices have grown to today (Ahem, GS3) and are looking the full package in a small box, this is the device for you.

9696,B01LEL8ABY,David Khong,1,9-May-18,True,Great phone until the battery dies early,"As many others have stated, this phone is great to use initially. I've been a Motorola customer back to the Razr and Atrix, and absolutely loved the 1st gen Moto X. The lightly skinned Android experience with the added Moto display, made this exactly what I wanted in my phone. At least until the battery died. Every phone owner understands battery degradation, but this is beyond degradation. The phone is useless unless plugged into the wall or into a portable charger. Even my Moto Mod battery pack is unable to keep it on without random shutdowns and the inability to power up without being plugged in. If you read the 100+ pages in the Lenovo/Motorola forum regarding the battery issue, it's surprising that nothing is being done to help the owners of this phone other than to recommend sending in for service. And since a good chunk of people are now outside of warranty, it'll cost you $150+ for replacement/repair. With this phone dying after 15 months of use, I couldn't convince myself that a replacement would get me much mileage, so the only solution is to look for a new phone that will not be a Motorola.",15.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

We let it connect to the network and then took my known working sim out and put it back in my Samsung. We restarted the G7 Power and viola! we had a data connection.

4607,B00MWI4KKE,Lauren Spano,1,9-Mar-16,True,Worst customer experience ever - stay away,"Let me preface this by saying that only 1.5 months ago, I really liked Motorola and loved my Moto X. Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and convenience. I was so wrong. Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days. But that wasn't the end. 5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model. The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'? Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation. This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product. At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too. In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable.",3.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) XT1097 GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4KKE,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HfPVitlfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4KKE,428,0.0,0.0

5394,B00TFAVFL4,Steven D. Smith,5,9-Jul-16,True,Great phone for low price!,"For many years I've been a no-contract go-phone user as my wife and I don't actually use our phones very much. We don't do enough calling or texting to warrant the expense of a monthly plan. We've never owned phones that have had mobile data. However, knowing of the advantages of a smart phone I decided it was time to get one. I first read a number of reviews to identify a relatively inexpensive one. After reading several of the reviews about this phone and it's approximately $50 price tag, I thought I'd give this one a shot. As of this writing I've owned my phone for about a month now and must say I'm very pleased with it. Since I'm around wi-fi all day long both at work and at home I don't need to use mobile data. Setup and use has been a breeze. You do have to set up an account on Google in order to access the Play Store to download apps. Every app I've downloaded has been a free one. This phone comes with a SIM card. It is a smaller SIM card than the one I had in my former (Alcatel) phone and wouldn't fit the new one, so I had to manually re-enter my phone contacts which was only a small inconvenience. I then called AT&T customer service to transfer the service from the old phone to the new one which took no more than 5 minutes each time (once for my phone, and once again for my wife's phone). TIP: Save the package the phone comes in so you can read off the numbers easily when the time comes to transfer the service to the new phone. One of the other reviews that swayed my decision stated a long battery life. I'm pleased to say that wasn't an exaggeration. I can easily go 2 or 3 days between re-charging for its 12-hour per day use.

3552,B00HPP3QD6,CC,5,9-Jul-14,False,Great Budget Prepaid Smartphone,"I have been a Verizon Prepaid subscriber for about two years with a basic phone (the LG Extravert). Verizon (even their prepaid service does have roaming until their contract service) has excellent coverage everywhere I go. When my phone started to show its age, I decided I finally wanted to upgrade to a smartphone. After doing research I settled on the Motorola Moto G. I picked it because it was reasonably priced, had a good display, ran the latest KitKat Android OS, and received overall very good reviews. I have always received good customer service from Verizon which has made me a satisfied customer. You should know that the Verizon version of the Moto G is a 3G device. At the time of purchase, Verizon prepay subscribers did not have access to Verizon's 4G LTE (now XLTE) network. This (post 7/17 when Verizon enabled access to 4G LTE is still a non-issue for me. When I have used 3G it is fast enough. Besides I typically use WiFI everywhere I go. My plan is only for 500MB which seems to be more than enough for my limited use of it. This phone also does not have an SD slot. Inside it comes with 8GB of on-board storage, which about 5GB is free for your use. I find it is large enough for me--especially with the free 50GB of Google Drive storage it comes with. There are a lot of good things about the Moto G. KitKat is certainly one of them. The camera is okay--better than a feature phone but not great compared to the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the Motorola Moto X. What I love it is the Motorola Assist app. I get a lot of phone calls, texts, and emails during the night when I want to be sleeping. I sleep much better with this app that silences the phone during the designated sleep times and meeting times. But rest easily knowing that in an emergency my phone would still ring if the caller calls twice in five minutes. This phone works well with pretty much every app in Google Play and is great for playing games on. If you are want a mid-level smartphone with much of the same abilities as the two year old Samsung Galaxy SIII with a still cheaper price look no further than the Moto G. Motorola really stepped it up with Google in designing the Moto series. I hope Motorola will keep up the good work when under Lenovo's control as the Moto G is the device to beat in the low priced mid-level smartphone market.",5.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

26374,B07WSJYDXX,nVeeGreen,4,9-Jan-19,False,Good no contract smartphone,"After I dropped my iPhone 7 and broke the screen, I ordered a new screen from Amazon to fix it (it would be the third Apple screen I've replaced over the years). During the replacement process, I learned (the hard way) that the home button connector pins are SUPER sensitive and SUPER easy to bend. The results? A 100% fixed screen with a non-working home button. Apple apparently won't let you replace the home button either without taking it to Apple Stores and paying them to reprogram a new one, defeating the whole purpose of repairing the phone yourself! Anyway, I bought the moto G6 out of spite for Apple and their repair policies. Switching from the iPhone, here are my observations after 3 months of use. GOOD: -Good size, comparable to any iPhone+ size. -Thumbprint reader works well and fast. -Facial unlock works well. -Screen is responsive (but is more difficult to type with a protector for some reason). -Camera is good quality. -Less than $200 and Sprint did NOT charge me an activation fee even though my contract was not up. -Expandable storage. -Great speaker. -Rapid charging with USB-C connector. -Hotspot works great. BAD: -Slower processing than iPhone 7. Noticeably. Opening the camera app takes up to 5 seconds longer once selected from the lock screen or performing a moto action. Doesn't seem like much, but compared to Apple's seemingly instant availability, this may frustrate former iPhone users. Takes longer to load certain apps. -It seems like every single available notification was turned ON by default. Took me a good month to find them all and turn off the unneeded ones. -Phone earpiece speaker (not during speakerphone or listening to music) is not loud enough. I constantly switch it to speakerphone to listen to conversations with quiet talkers. -Cannot swipe forward or backward in Chrome from the screen. Must use the arrow button or perform a moto action to go back. Considering that I go back a lot in browsing, it seems like an extra step when going back a page. -Battery life is average to mediocre. With a phone this size, I would expect a larger capacity battery, and even though Lenovo claims great battery life, I find that it's no better than my smaller iPhone 7 and must be recharged every night, and sometimes by the afternoon. I am happy with the phone, even with its shortcomings. I knew what I signed up for when I made this purchase, and it is great for the price. I don't think I could ever pay $1000 or more for a phone again, just to satisfy my complaints listed in the CONS section of this review. There are better moto models available if you think you do need better processing and speed, but you will pay more for them, but not likely flagship model pricing. I think that if you are interested in making the switch from Apple to Android, this phone provides a modest price point to experiment with how you will adapt to a new phone OS, which can lead to a more expensive Android purchase down the road without having to commit to a carrier's lease, payments, or activation. I'm content with this phone, but if I decide to stay with Android after 9 years with Apple, I think I would look into a more featured model. Otherwise, this is a great ""starter"" Android phone.

4534,B00MWI4KKE,Andrew Philipoff,1,9-Feb-16,True,"worst phone I've ever purchased, will never buy another Motorola phone","Don't buy this phone! I bought a Motorola Moto X 2nd generation phone for my college age son to take on a trip to South America. He's pretty careful with phones and is rather tech savvy.Throughout his trip, he contacted me regarding a number of issues he had: the phone kept overheating, poor battery life, poor connectivity (despite the fact that he had an international plan with data). The final nail in the coffin was about three weeks into his trip this phone crashed and upon rebooting the display was black and the phone ran very hot. Imagine trying to help someone troubleshoot something from 6000+ miles away and a 5 hour time difference. Try searching on google for ""Motorola moto x black screen"", there are hundreds of reports of this issue, with very few positive outcomes. The potentially tragic part of this was that my son took 700+ pictures before it failed. We finally gave up and upon his return we spent almost an entire day trying to troubleshoot this issue. Nothing we did changed this situation, all attempts to revive this phone failed. On a positive note, it did manage to connect to my home wifi network and all (we hope) his images did get uploaded to Google via the Photos app we downloaded prior to his departure. I tried everything on the Motorola troubleshooting web page and finally called their technical support line. I spent over an hour on the phone with people who obviously knew nothing about their product. Turns out this is a known issue, for which there is no resolution other than wiping the phone. They offered to repair/replace the phone. The insulting part was that they wanted to charge me a $25 fee for ""expedited replacement"", I opted for the standard free service. Here it is almost two weeks and still no word on when a replacement unit will be sent. I will never purchase another Motorola product as long as I live. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has owned numerous Motorola phones, including my current Motorola Droid Turbo. From now on I will take the advice of my friends and buy more reliable phones such as a Samsung Galaxy or a Google Nexus.

270,B002WTC1NG,TinkerMan,3,9-Feb-11,False,Hit or (mostly) Miss Phone....,"My wife and I finally decided to upgrade our VZW phones but really didn't want or need ""smart"" phones. Unfortunately, most carriers have drastically reduced the number and quality of basic ""feature"" phones they carry - I suspect it's an underhanded effort to ""encourage"" customers to buy the more expensive phones and data plans. At the kiosk where we shopped - there were only 3 feature phones available and the Motorola Barrage seemed to be the pick of the litter. My Barrage has worked well since the purchase - however - I make very few calls during the day and the ones I do make are brief. On the other hand, my wife's Barrage was a disaster... she uses hers just a little more than I use mine - but is not, by any means, a cell phone junkie. Her initial charge lasted 5 days - GREAT! The next full charge lasted about 3 days - HUH? The next full charge lasted less than a day - CRAP!!! Verizon gladly offered to exchange the phone - but they were 'out of stock'. We waited several days for a replacement - only to learn that the phone was being discontinued and there would be NO new ones. A couple of these phones were finally located at a WalMart about 20 mile away - so, I made the trip and exchanged the phones. HOWEVER, her new phone was worse than the first.... the initial full charge lasted just a little over a day. I did an internet search and found this to be quite a common problem for this phone. I tried every posted ""fix"" to no avail. My wife grew tired of dealing with it and finally exchanged her Barrage for an LG Clout... which has performed flawlessly and gives her 5 days to a full charge. I'm just praying MY Barrage doesn't peter out now. Maybe I'm lucky and got a ""good"" one. Other minor complaints.... the battery cover is hard to install properly - even the Verizon agent didn't know how. If the cover is not FULLY seated, the phone WILL NOT be water resistant..... you can find this discussed on several different websites as well. Once you learn a few tricks, it becomes easier to do. The MP3 player interface is the quite dated and clunky old Verizon ""V Cast"".... it's high time Verizon reworked this dinosaur into something a little more flexible. There is no graphic equalizer - heck, there's not even a basic tone adjustment - so you'll have to live with the fairly flat audio the player has. The headphone jack is 2.5mm - unfortunately, common headphones have a 3.5mm plug and won't work without an adapter (I finally bought a pair of BlackBerry earbuds with a 2.5mm plug on Amazon for $4 and they work GREAT!!!). The Barrage is a bit thick compared to other flip phones and may be uncomfortable to hold in smaller hands. The thickness also makes finding a suitable case difficult. So - only 1 (out of 3) of these phones worked for us.... those are not great odds. I like mine so far - but I'm nervous that it won't last and I can not recommend this phone without some serious reservations. If you're seriously considering this phone (as Dirty Harry would say) you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?""

However, the last 2 phones I had, we huge let downs. My best friend had an older Motorola, and was upgrading to this E plus. She got her's and let me look at it, and mess around for a few days, until her Sim card arrived. Anyway, I started researching new phones, and was not impressed with what really was offered, as far as what I needed it for. I use prepaid Verizon, and went to their store to see what kind of deal I could get with new service & a phone instead of the prepaid. They had nothing I remotely would lock into a 2 year service plan for. I went to AT& T because they were offering the new Samsung 8 buy one get one free, what a joke that was. Anyway, after eyeballing this EPlus, and researching reviews that were legitimate. I decided to take a chance. Since getting the phone, and trying and figuring it out I absolutely love this phone. Basically if you are used to Samsungs or Android platforms, this phone is just a stripped down Android, meaning it doesn't come with all the bloatware that Samsungs and others do with preinstalled apps that cannot be removed. I opted for the model with no ads I bought my daughter the HD8 and upgraded because the ads were so annoying. This phone is perfect for me,. The battery life nothing short of amazing.

26113,B07W14HFQP,P. Quinn,2,9-Aug-18,False,"Works great, until it fails, and fails, and fails","While my Motorola was a great phone, when it functioned, it failed to power up after eight months. The replacement they sent failed to produce sound, either by headphone jack or speaker, after another four months. At this point, to get a replacement for the new replacement, they wanted to charge me a $24.99 ""Premium"" fee to have it sent to me before they received the (second) defective phone back from me. This is the first year of ownership. The (second) replacement they sent failed to make sound, or have a functioning microphone, eight months later. Customer service sent an automated response to my service request, promising a response to my concerns ""within 24 hours"". This never happened. So, after waiting a couple of days, I contacted them via service chat and, then, phone. This time, I was told that the phone was ""out of warrantee,"" and was kindly offered the chance to pay a fee of $125 to replace this (second) replacement and, again, the additional fee of $24.99 to have one sent immediately. After having three of the same model each fail before two years of ownership, after eight, four, and eight months, respectively, I said that this was unacceptable. After much haggling, they offered to take 25% off of this replacement fee for an ""out-of-warrantee"" phone that had functioned properly for eight months. I am not a careless or rough user. These phones were all in cases, never stepped on or cracked. Not sure which is worse; their build quality or their customer service.

15674,B075SKYZXY,Amazon Customer,5,9-Aug-18,True,Great phone but Moto Mods are meh,"This is a great phone, although the Moto Mods are almost completely useless. Not only are they very expensive, but the mods that have an internal battery only use that battery to power the mod itself; it is not shared with the phone in anyway. The only mods I can see actually being useful are the battery packs but they are still much more expensive than a generic portable battery pack, so keep that in mind. Also, the mods cannot be used while the phone is in any sort of case. So, if you are getting this phone for the ""spectacular"" mods, you may find yourself very disappointed. The phone itself is very thin and light. It makes my old Samsung feel very heavy (which already seemed super light compared to any iPhone). I love the fingerprint sensor. Not only does it unlock the phone bypassing the lock screen, it can also be used to shut the screen off and lock the phone. Of course it works in place of a password or PIN for many apps as well which is very convenient. As far as the UI, it is very very close to plain Jane Android. Motorola has made very few customisations. It does come with several Moto apps preinstalled, but many of them can actually be uninstalled, not merely disabled. Others can only be disabled. If you are used to Samsung as I am, Moto is not nearly as bad as Samsung is about all the extra apps. Overall, I am very happy that I made the switch to this phone. One last note: I tried the Z3 Play as well for comparison and hated it, mainly because the fingerprint sensor was moved to the right side of the phone and can no longer be used to lock the phone. Even though the Z3 Play is newer and has a larger screen, this phone is still superior in many ways (I.E. fingerprint sensor, screen resolution, main camera, and CPU speed to name a few).",3.0,Motorola,Motorola Moto Z2 Force XT1789 64GB Lunar Gray T-Mobile,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Force-XT1789-Lunar-T-Mobile/dp/B075SKYZXY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ddMNyQe6L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075SKYZXY,56,0.0,0.0

I figured I'd pay the extra money to get a Mil-spec phone and not have to worry about damage happening. I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone.

9818,B01LEL8ABY,Smithy Smith,3,8-Oct-16,True,Mehhh. Just okay.,"Dangit Lenovo. My elderly XT1053 first generation MotoX died about a year ago and I have been eagerly awaiting the MotoZ. I've been using an iPhone 6 for that year. It hasn't been the worst year of my life. That award goes to the year I caught my incestuous ex-wife with her obese cousin. What sucks about the MotoZ? Read on: * It is simply too big. After a Bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, I really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be. * The camera is somehow always blurry. This is great for pictures of my deep-Appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars. * The ""wood-style-back"" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood. A wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic. My original MotoX had real wood backing. Somehow I missed that ""wood-style"" means ""not wood anymore"". I admit, I researched weakly.

When looking for a replacement for my dying Nexus 6P, I focused on Motorola because of their deal with Ifixit. I'm not 100% sure what the deal means to me, but I like the spirit of it. I selected the Motorola One because it had all the features I want (no, it doesn't have the barometer like my old 6p but it does have an FM radio), and the price was great. The hitch(es): it's an ""international"" phone, and it claims not to have a warranty. The international part means the box is printed in Spanish (Mexican I think), as is the initial screen. Once I setup the phone in English, I never saw Spanish again. As for the warranty, in all the years I've had a mobile phone, I've never had to use it. So, I'm willing to gamble.

7247,B0192XJ0P6,Trey S.,4,8-Nov-17,False,I honestly love this phone. Even though I've been through four them in the past year and half.,"I actually got this phone through Verizon with my plan. Anyway, so I've had 4 of these phones in the past year and a half. The first two had a software malfunction, causing them to be stuck on the Motorola start up screen. Both had been easily replaced by the Motorola for free. The third one I had, I accidentally busted both of the cameras. I took it out one night at a bar to show off the shatter proof display as a group of friends and I were showing off our phones. I only dropped it twice and then everyone started getting uncomfortable because no one could bare the thought of their phones being dropped on the ground and fear of the aftermath. The morning after the magic tricks I didn't notice anything was wrong except for some new scuff marks on the corner but whenever I opened Snapchat I discovered my cameras, front and back, had been busted. All I could see through the cameras were little shards off glass and a very distorted image of what ever I was pointing at. So I ended up paying the $100 through my insurance to get another one. This one I have now has lasted me the longest but I has slowed down on me a bit in the past 8 months of having it. Experiencing a lot of hiccups and overall lagginess to it which is a shame since the phones build is so strong and durable and obviously made to last. But like most android phones their software stability with hardware will never be as fluid as an iPhone. I would love to see another release of a smartphone with this shatter shield technology but something obviously more powerful and stable.

If you must have a Verizon phone because of coverage, then why bother with this budget device when you can just sign a contract for about the same amount per month and have a top of the line phone with LTE, for example?

All the way up thru the Moto G5, things were great, mostly improving at least incrementally .. and this phone is like that in every department except the one most important to me: battery life.

What I absolutely loved about this phone was that as soon as I turned it on it updated to android Kit-Kat. (Amazing btw) Seeing as how the screen isn't OLED, it does use a bit more power, which brings me to my next point. On moderate use I get about 12-17 hours use. Much better than the Merit I had before. Another great point about this phone would be its speaker. I work in the back of a busy restaurant and we don't have a radio. We previously used an iPod that we put under a plate to amplify the sound, but now I have to put this phone at only 75% and everyone in the back can hear it. The notification LED is only one color (white) The removable back is just for show, you can't remove the battery, and there is no micro sd card slot. Which is the only downside to this phone, no expandable storage. You're stuck with the 8 gigs they give you. Sure you get 50 free gigs of Google drive storage upon turning the phone on for the first time, but unless you have a constant internet connection that'll be worthless. I highly recommend purchasing the flipshell case from motorolla.

25288,B07SBJPYLW,vbac,5,8-Jun-19,True,Int Version - Works & Works Well - Great Phone @ Budget Price,"I don't know why Motorola refuses to release these phones in the US. But it is a great Google One phone. I was an HTC guy - My HTC 10 dropped, and screen cracked. While i was waiting for the HTC 11 to be released - i bought the Moto G5+ as a cheap ""burner"" when i saw it shopping at Costco - and fell in love. A $200 phone with the insanely helpful gestures...decent camera, sound, speed, headphone jack, SD card... So, when the G6+ was due out - I was ready to buy... But it was not avail in the US ... waited a year... The G7+ - looked great - again, Not available in the US... and some Amazon reviewers were saying they didn't know if 4G LTE would work... Likely because of my cookies - a news story came up on my G-News feed abut the upcoming Motorola One Vision - with a very fast chipset, 6-3"" tall, 48mp camera (kinda) ...Headphone jack, Micro SD slot,,, I began reading every article about it... Only to find out that it too would not be available in the US. (Again, I am clueless at to what Motorola's strategy is...) But the one difference is a very technical website did highlight that the M-O-Vision does support a lot of the LTE bands that US phones use - at least for T-Mobile - which my Straight Talk Wireless account uses - (Burbank, CA). Every review i read from other counties it was released in - were glowing. One reviewer didn't recommend because of the screen - But outside of that - all positive. My Phone arrived on Wednesday - Still setting it up - But so far - Pretty amazing - Very cool and different look, formwise - the finish, 128 GB internal, Moto gestures, it is a Google One phone - so, you will get that G-Update support. The camera took i-phone level (see picture of my pants close up) sharp colorful pictures outdoors - (and the biggest feature of the camera is supposed to be the nightshots, which i haven't taken yet.) The lean-ness of the G-One /Moto software didn't provide too many options to control the look of the screen - so, i downloaded a screen app, to slightly increase contrast - and now it looks great. Lastly - my internet is much faster. I thought it was a service issue on my old phone - but now realize the phone was just slower... Very fast on the MOV. The calls go though faster - I called my sister back East this am - She said asked if this was my new phone - because it was the clearest she had heard me outside of the office, She said it sounded like a land line! how cool is that. I don't do games too much - Movies do play and look great on it...again guessing the speed and power and RAM helps that a lot... It does Support NFC Google Pay... The only thing i have to look into is the sound through Bluetooth - The phone itself is Very loud... but through bluetooth in my car - it didn't quite sound as rich as the Moto5+ - but this phone offers Dolby, i believe just like the screen - , i probably just need to play around with settings. I haven't tried a bunch of things - Night Camera, GPS...Actually paying with Google Pay yet... but everything shows that it is on and active. And as someone pointed out - it comes with a clear soft case, so you can still see the phone. And yes - It does turbo charge - you do get to 30% or so very quickly. I can't tell you about how long the batter lasts in normal usage, because i have been transferring, downloading, and setting up almost all day since it arrived. The charge lasts a full day under those abnormal circumstances. One important thing - There are international variants - from the kimovil website - it looked like the Th XT1970-1 model has the most LTE bands in common with the US. But you should probably do your own research. That site helped me the most - but, i probably looked at 20+ before deciding to take the chance. OK- Please excuse any horrible typos - Hope the War and Peace length review was helpful... if it wasn't clear... I recommend it a bunch.",59.0,Motorola,"Motorola One Vision (128GB) 6.3' Full HD Display, 48MP Camera, Dual SIM US + GLOBAL 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked XT1970-1 - International Version (Blue)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Display-Factory-Unlocked-XT1970-1/dp/B07SBJPYLW,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mBlkYEC4L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07SBJPYLW,56,240.0,270.0
24461,B07QP7WZ1T,Amazon Customer,5,8-Jun-19,True,Battery life not 3 days but very good phone.,"Purchased 2 of the Motorola G7 Power for my husband and myself. We are using them on Cricket wireless which works on AT&T network. So far in the last 24+ hours of owning this phone I've been satisfied. (We both had ZTE Blade X Max but they were slowly functioning poorly, my spouse's worse than mine but mine was catching up.) The phones arrives new with a clear rubber/plastic low profile case, wall charger and USB-C charging cable, along with the little metal key to pop out the SIM and mini SD card. Battery percentage was at 66%. There are 2 SIM card slots and one slot for a mini SD card. Slot #1 is the primary slot to use. You can put another SIM card in slot #2 for a different phone number or if going out of the country, a SIM card that matches those local networks without roaming charges. Very easy to update the Motorola G7 Power from each of our cloud storage. Took about 20 minutes for a complete update of my apps. Longest thing was going into each app and re-entering our passwords. Battery life is acceptable. With normal usage, i.e. social media, emails, photos, I can see the battery lasting about 36 hours before needing a charge. If you play games and constantly have the phone on, the battery should last about 24 hours before needing a charge. I feel 3 days battery life is only if you text and make phone calls, if the phone sits dormant for a while. ***Edit*** I've owned this phone for one week now. My battery has lasted about 42 hours until fully drained after normal social media and email usage. Happy with the speed and camera, exterior speaker is tinny, could be better. Phone call quality is nice and clear. Down side is that my Fitbit does not recognize this model phone for texts and phone calls but it did sync quickly to still work with the Fitbit app for tracking purposes. Also the case/sleeve it comes with is a little slippery. I will be purchasing a more durable case.

After factory reset the phone was working almost fine, but the EXACT same thing happened to my husbands phone and we did the same, however his phone is still not working properly! specially for a new phone, it takes longer than mine to do anything. Would NOT recommend this phone due to issues with crashing, apps not responding, slow camera, wifi turns on and off randomly even after setting it up not to. I had a BLU prior to this one, cheaper and much better, I thought a Motorola was going to be great, NOT! Update: latest update srewed up the phone. Most apps crash!! Video quality super slow even if the video is saved/downloaded on the phone. I checked with my provider and did some troubleshooting and everything seems fine on that end. This is the first time a new phone has lasted so little time without any issues. What now? I just bought this phone, unlocked. It looks amazing!

18329,B07C2VFMN2,Barry R. Williams,5,8-Jul-19,True,"Solid phone, no bloatware, cool gadgets","I bought this phone WITHOUT the Amazon integrations. I've read that they can't be disabled or removed from that models version of Android, but I can't confirm that. That said, I did find it to be a big enough issue that I paid a little more the version without it. I love this phone. I switched from an Essential Ph1 and have owned pretty much every Samsung flagship released in the past 5 years. I'm on a personal boycott of Samsung after they failed to honor my warranty on my Note, but that's another review on a different website. I honestly don't like theiecosystem and experience that Samsung has built. It kinda feels like a bizarre version of iOS at times. Moving on... With the ZPlay 3, I really see little difference other than the frequency of updates provided by Motorola, Motorola is significantly slower, and the lack of any fluff and customization as provided by Samsung. Essential basically releases updates immediately after Google, so the bar is extremely high in that regard. Motorola has been slower to release updates than I would like, but the updates have been flawless. This phone has very little bloatware. It's extremely close to stock Android and really quick. I've had zero issue and very little slow down if any. I rarely play games on my phone, but have no gameplay issues when I do. Load times aren't terrible, but they certainly aren't the fastest. Think Mustang, not Corvette. Motorola should've had the latest OS update to this phone way faster, but their customization of Android mimicked it pretty well. The motomads are pretty cool. I basically always have the extra battery on unless I'm using the projector to screen Netflix on the hotel ceiling if traveling. Battery life is close to two full days in this configuration. It will even get you through a full work day without the extra battery. Not having the fastest processor on the market actually helps a bit in that regard. I do love using the projector mod while paired with a a good Bluetooth speaker. The factory speaker sounds pretty good, but isn't loud enough if more than one person is trying to listen. Bottom Line: If you don't want to spend flagship money this phone will serve you well. If you have no need for the mods, check out the Motorola G7. It's a great budget phone and can be had cheaper than the ZPlay 3.",7.0,Motorola,Motorola Z3 Play & Moto Power Pack - Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) - 64GB - Deep Indigo (US Warranty) - PA9S0000US,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z3-Play-Power-Pack/dp/B07C2VFMN2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N-Axwzz1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07C2VFMN2,84,229.99,499.99

It is very fast and started updating as soon as I turned it on. 3. It comes with Alexa which is a plus and fun to use. 4. Charge - This is my main phone and holds a charge far better than my last phone (HTC M8) ever did. 5. The Finger Print sensor works flawlessly and also doubles for several shortcuts. That is, slide you finger across it and it will move pages and files back and forth, as well as, a few other things. 6. Wrist action Shortcuts - This means you can twist your wrist for the Camera or chop your hand to turn on flashlight, or you can just just pass you hand hand over the face of the phone and it will come on to show you the time and any notifications you might have. 7. Call quality is excellent. You can hear a person like they are standing next to you, no distortion. 8. The on and off button, as well as, the volume button is on the right side which makes it easy to turn it off. 9. Its a little wider that the Moto G6, but not so wide you can't easily hold it in one hand. 10. Camera... I found the camera to be excellent, far superior to my old HTC M8. 11. Charging - It is very Fast, I just charged it at 40% and it was at 100% in 50 mins. 12. Display is really excellent. CONS - Honestly, I have only found 2 main Cons. 1. Being that I'm a Verizon user, it does not allow you to download your Contacts and etc from the Cloud. I called Verizon and went into their store and they gave me 2 ways to get my contacts; 1. Sign into Verizon, then copy your contacts from your Cloud and email from your them to yourself. In this option, once you have the email, you can just touch them and your email with ask you if you want to save the contact. Or, 2... use Content to Content Transfer, that is, direct Transfer the files from you old phone to your new one. There are many apps that allow you to do this, but I had so much trouble with this option I just chose Option #1. As far as my other files and pictures, I had backed them up on Google prior to going over the X4, as well as, had them on my SD card. 2. Its glass - I bought a holster to put it in cause it is very slipper and if dropped, your going to be in trouble.

9740,B01LEL8ABY,Amazon Customer,1,8-Feb-17,True,Was once an outstanding phone,"Almost 2 years to the day, my Moto Z still looks and feels like brand new except for the fact that the battery lasts about 20 minutes. I bought the Motorola Moto-Mod Battery pack. It's truly sad that I had to rely on the Moto-Mod to actually power my phone rather than use it to extend the usage between charges. The battery usage pattern is erratic - it will show 90+%, drop to 40%, and then turn off - all within about 6 minutes ..... turning the phone back on is impossible unless it's plugged in to the wall *and* connected to the Moto-Mod battery pack because the phone shows 3% battery. I am surprised and disappointed that Motorola, the manufacturer of extremely high quality communications products (police radios, etc. etc.) is unable to provide a solution for this problem. I am further disappointed that the world's manufacturers of just about EVERYTHING that requires a battery are making products that do not give the consumer the ability to swap out batteries easily. Gone are the days where things are built to last. Do not by this phone. I wrote this 2 years ago.... This is an amazing phone - I am most impressed by the 3 days of battery availability on a single charge. Of course, your own phone usage pattern will affect the amount of time it takes to discharge but, overall, Motorola has taken the many lessons it learned from many of its products and rolled them up into this phone.

But Verizon made me purchase minutes? - Fixed, great phone!","It seems like the seller(s?) don't know the difference between the prepaid version of the phone and the standard contract version. Either that or Verizon is just full of idiots (entirely possible.) When I activated the phone online, with the aid of Verizon live chat service, it made me dial a number and then required me to purchase minutes. I have read other reviewers say that Verizon would not/could not activate their phone on the prepaid network. I'm not sure what's going on but I'm pretty irritated. I like the phone, alot for the use I've gotten out of it so far (very little), but the whole reason I ditched my smartphone was because I was sick of all the complicated BS. P.S. If anyone could help me figure out what's going on here I'd appreciate it. EDIT: Apparently me and Verizon were both being idiots. I have it active and working as it should now. The phone itself is wonderful. Since I still have a data plan I can get all kinds of cute little arcade games and apps. Simple things of course but I'm a simple lady. It's a pretty sturdy phone, it's lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it's designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The 'closed' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn't sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof ""up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes"" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I'm sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I'm happy with this little guy. Oh and no more charging my phone twice a day. I haven't charged it since I got it a week ago and despite use in almost every possible way it didn't get down to one battery bar until today.

I ask only that it make and receive calls, stand up to a decent amount of rough handling, and not crap out when I get a little sweaty (talking while exercising). Yeah, it sounds silly, but I've had several that died from that small amount of moisture. The Barrage has been good to me so far (about 40 days).

3864,B00JS73V2U,Crazycucumbers,3,8-Aug-15,False,"Good choice, but has problems.","This was at one time a very reliable yet relatively cheap and accessible device. How is it now? That depends on how you want to use it. I generally don't use my phone for much web searching, game playing, or anything really smartphone related, oddly enough. For gaming purposes, I'm not a casual gamer at all. Small games on phones don't interest me as much as something that might be on a 3DS for example. That doesn't mean I don't have games I like to play on my phone or tablet though. So without further ado, allow me to go into detail on this device. Cellphone, texting: It's a phone, what do you expect? It calls and texts as it should, a plus, obviously. One time, for about 3 days, whenever I received a call, nobody could here me talking to them. I checked repeatedly to make sure I didn't mute them or anything. Multiple people I talked to couldn't hear me, so they all didn't accidentally mute me. It only happened once and happened for a few days. It hasn't returned since. Web Browsing: If you plan on doing a lot of web searching on your device, look elsewhere. This thing is pretty slow on Chrome. With Chrome being the only app open, and only having one tab open, it took about 2 minutes to get to plain old google.com. No joke. It sat there loading forever, but the same website could be accessed in mere seconds on about any other device in the house (including my 3DS). Restarting my phone solved the slowness issue for a bit, but it didn't take long for it to return. I use it for web search on rare occasions when I have no other option at the time, and if you get this phone, you should expect the same. Games: If you're looking for a variety of games, this phone (like any Android phone really) comes installed with Google Play, so there are tens of thousands of games to be played. But this is not the device to play them on. Playing Geometry Dash, as an example, is next to impossible on this thing. The level gets far out of sync with the music, so you could make a jump and 3 seconds later, the music part that corresponded to that jump would finally play. Not only that, but it constantly freezes up and lags like crazy, even on levels that are extremely basic. The freezing and lag happens on every game you play on this thing, so expect the difficulty to be bumped up a lot. Screen: This screen is only 720p, but you probably can't tell. It looks fantastic! The screen only turns on where it needs to, so instead of making the pixels black, it just turns that part of the screen off while being entirely usable. It's something you'd have to see in person to fully understand, but as a result the color black looks especially good on this device. All of the colors are really vibrant and bright, the screen is one of the best I've seen. Sound: The sound isn't anything too special. It isn't good, it isn't bad, pretty average. But average isn't always a bad thing. Youtube: Surprisingly, it runs Youtube very well. I can run a 720p video no problem, but not at 60fps. 1080p gets a little freezy, but 720 should be enough to satisfy most people, including me. Look/Feel: This device looks pretty awesome, honestly. It also has a nice weight and thickness to it, which some people may not appreciate. Thin devices are cool, but they also tend to be the more fragile ones. Besides the fact that it is harder to get a good grip on smaller devices, and easier to drop them. That's why this would be a good choice if you are worried about that. The outside is glossy which gets fingerprints and slime quickly, which kind of sucks. The top edge of the screen likes to gather dust and crumbs and stuff, and can get pretty nasty looking quickly. It is also hard to clean out, so be careful. Extras: This has a decent camera. I rarely take pictures, so I can't tell you how it looks compared to another camera, but I think it looks pretty good. The front facing camera is something I haven't used, as I don't like taking pictures of myself especially. I can't tell you how it looks. It doesn't have a micro sd card slot that I've found, so get the size you want. Its battery is pretty good. On standby it can last 3 to 4 days. I don't know how long it'll last while using it, but it seems pretty good there. It does come with a little bloatware, so be prepared for that. It has not updated to Android Lollipop yet, which is annoying because Motorola's website says that it'll get the update. It's been almost a year already, we should've gotten the update by now. To sum up: It's a solid choice if you only plan to use it for calling and texting, but if you want to constantly search the internet, go look at another phone.",9.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID MAXX, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-MAXX-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00JS73V2U,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717w0Z516KL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00JS73V2U,263,0.0,0.0

3329,B00HPP3QD6,A,5,7-Sep-15,True,Still a Great Phone In 2015,"I had some doubts when deciding on buying this phone, like if it would be fast enough, if the battery would last long enough or even if itwas durable enough. Those thoughts went away quickly as soon as I got this phone, but still have some problems with it. Pros: It has plenty of battery life to last full day with with moderate use, but sometimes I don't take it easy on this phone and it gets around 3 hours of battery life (On a Full Charge). The camera is better than I expected taking clean and clear pictures. I suggest using HDR mode for cleaner photo, but to get the best picture you need to be outside in sunlight The speed of this phone is decent for many task like checking Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and light Web browsing is quick and snappy with gaming being smooth on MOST games unless they are graphicly intense like asphalt 8, goat simulator and some emulators. The durability is above my expectations as I dropped this on the side walk and it still didn't crack I also carry this in my pocket with some coins and the screen doesn't scratch up the so the screen. The screen looks really good for the price of this phone at a 720p display with 329 ppi you could say it's on par with the iPhone 5 but I couldn't tell me the difference. The speakers are pretty loud, louder than I expected but the sound is still distorted when you get the volume high, but other than that it's pretty good. Call quality is decent from the other end people said I sounded clear and I had no problems with dropped calls. Cons:There are no 5 ghz bands on this phone and this phone is 3g only This phone has no nfc Whenever you return to the home screen some times the apps need to take a second to load which is which constantly annoyed me. This phone may not get a lot of scratches but it gets a lot of smudges which makes the phone hard to see in direct sunlight and without the smudges the daytime visibility is still terrible. There are some dead pixels on my moto g and this may be a result of manufacturing errors and only extends to this phone but it is a problem. There is no way to get a battery percentage on this phone and I have looked and can't find one This device hasn't gotten lollipop yet as of this review and still has kit Kat, but Verizon plans to get it on this phone. This device can't be rooted and the bootloader can't be unlocked on Verizon. No expandable storage Overall this phone has really good speed and can handle everyday task decently it may not have the best specs and have the latest software, but if you want a phone that gets things done I recommend this phone.",2.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

Seems there may be some issue with phone turning off and never coming back on. But with ANYTHING if you sell so many 1000 phones you will have a few with issues. Now also what junk apps did you download? I have had this phone over a year. The phone before this was droid razr Maxx. I broke 2 razr Maxx screens. And I have another that screen no longer shows anything but phone powers on. As for the Droid Maxx I had it in a $7 case from eBay till about 2mos ago. My case broke as I was trying to remove. I have dropped this phone so many times now as it is super slick. I have dropped it face first on concrete, rocks, asphalt, steal grat and each time I think I'm going to pickup a phone with broken screen, its still not broken. The metal bezel aroung the glass has soany pits and scuffs from the phone hitting the pavement and sliding. Still no cracks or scratches on screen. As far as someone mentioning can't get IMEI out of phone, guess you should have kept box or paperwork. Or call your cell provider and ask them for it. Read another where screen is unresponsive, it will be if you have to much running and RAM gets below 500mb. Use a good task manager like ""Advanced Task Manager"" with the red X. Set to kill on screen lock. Works perfect. Or take you case or screen protector off and clean the phone. Yes camera sux, download Google camera. I disabled every app that i do not use of tge blotware tgat came with phone. Battery life is is exceptional on this phone. I have 7 emails that check for new mail constantly, I run Google+ and photos backup and Intellicast, Call Recorder, Airdroid and Hangouts. Texting, surfing and on phone alot.

One reason I purchased this phone was because it claimed a US Warranty, but Motorola will not back the warranty, and the Seller simply told me I could return the item (Motorola won't even allow me to register the device with them, and Seller claims they bought it directly from Motorola). A relative purchased the same phone through a different Seller (also, on Amazon), and he ran into the same issue. If you want a Motorola-backed Warranty, be aware that you may not get it if there is a Seller other than Amazon involved. Otherwise, the phone is a fantastic upgrade from my Moto X 2nd Gen.

10945,B01MDMJGYT,King Monty,2,7-Mar-17,True,"Nice phone, but package seals were broken.","I received my 2 phones from seller Wireless Place. Each box contained the following: 1 Moto Z Play phone (model XT1635-02) 1 wood grain snap on back cover 1 USB A to USB C cable (3ft) 1 UK 15w turbo charger 1 wired stereo headphones with inline mic Out of the box, the phone is working great so far. Unfortunately, I live in the US, and there is no adapter for the UK plug, so it is useless to me. Other reviewers mentioned that their package contained a US adapter, but mine did not.. One major concern that I have is that the Motorola seal on both units packaging was broken, meaning that the boxes had been opened before I received them. I question why this was done, and wonder if something was taken from the boxes, such as the US charging adapter? Considering that the product is listed as ""New"", the seal on the boxes should not have been broken, and I assume that the package contents was altered. Even so, I do have functioning phones that appear to be working properly, but I feel that this deserves a 2 start rating from this seller, unless they can give me a very good explanation on why the seals were broken.",36.0,Motorola,"Motorola MOTO Z PLAY (XT1635) Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen - 32GB - Black (International Version - No Warranty)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1635-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B01MDMJGYT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YWHpWk7+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MDMJGYT,161,169.0,0.0

69,B002UHS0UI,George,5,7-Mar-13,True,Great option vs data plan phones,"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.",4.0,Motorola,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver,https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Wireless-Motorola-RAZR-V3m/dp/B002UHS0UI,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pVtPaTkML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,2.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B002UHS0UI,208,0.0,0.0

If you can live with that then this phone is for you. I purchased it directly from Google fi to tidy me over until Pixel 4 debut assuming Google doesn't screw it up like they did Pixel 2 (screen issues) and 3 (mother of all notches). It replaced my Nexus 6P which doesn't receive security updates any longer from Google. It's running almost a stock Android skin with minimal bloatware. It's fast and has some unique features such as capability to detect when you're driving and offering to announce calls and texts messages. Size and feel is similar to Samsung Galaxy S9+ (see attached side by side photos). Even though Google has it listed in stock as one of the Fi capable phones be aware that updates is Motorola's or is it Lenovo's responsibility? Never mind that Motorola does not even list Google fi as one of the supported carriers on their support Page.

This phone easily competes with the iPhone 6 for a fraction of the cost. The only minor drawback similar to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is the browser tends to reload even with as few as two tabs.

Side note: I use this phone in the US on a T-Mobile network and used it in Europe with a second sim card. After a few weeks of use, I have some major disappointments: - You CANNOT format an SD card as internal and CANNOT move apps to it. You can only Format it as ""portable"", That's for me a major disappointment as you cannot move apps to it and free space on your phone. - Battery life: the 3000mAh is a bit on the small size for a phone like that, compared to my G6, I painfully feel the difference. This battery is not properly sized for a phone that size. I strongly feel that the G7 Power 3500 mAh battery would have been more appropriate for this phone. I used a lot on vacation and I was taking a ton of pictures. As such, camera & Google photo were running all the time and the battery was dying midday. I very quickly opted for a battery bank and a bunch of charging cables. As of now, in regular usage, the battery is lasting about 9 hrs. - C to C USB Charger? Really? WTF!

Compared to my $500 Nexus 6P this phone is great and I won't freak out if it is lost or accidently broken because of it's low cost. I'm not a tech person but wanted to comment about concerns about this phone and problems on the Sprint network. Earlier reviews mentioned problems streaming music from Spotify and Pandora with this phone on the Sprint network. I was concerned that this would also be a problem with Amazon Music streaming. It is not. When we activated our phone we went to a non-corporate Sprint store and they did not have the right SIM card so we drove over to a Sprint Corporate store and 20 minutes later we were all hooked-up and are able to stream music on Amazon Prime with no problems. Same with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube etc. So if you use these products and are on the Sprint network, and were concerned about streaming, you should be good with this phone.

9888,B01LEL8ABY,T. Joyce,1,7-Jan-17,False,Don't buy unlocked version. Bad support.,"I have bought six Moto phones. This will be my last. It is a good phone but if you buy the unlocked GSM version you may not get updates. These phones are still on version 6 and the July security level. Lenovo is not committing to deliver an update to Android 7. They had promised it for Dec 2016 and did not deliver. We don't have the security patches and the battery life on the Moto Z is less than a day on Android 6. Also, I bought a number of the Moto Mods and they are problematic. The Hasselblad camera is OK but not really much better picture quality as the stick camera, which is disappointing for what it costs. The JBL speaker is not loud. The Incipio battery is great but can only charge when attached to the phone which is annoying. I did not buy the projector so I can't comment on that. The stock camera on the phone has a lag after you click the button to take the picture. This goes away in Pro mode but I don't use Pro mode, I just want to point and click. This camera is also not as good as what I had on the Moto X v2, though it is better than the v1 (much).

7248,B0192XJ0P6,Lance Lary,5,7-Jan-16,False,Recommended for those looking for durability,"I chose my last two smartphones for their sleek designs and beautiful displays. I then proceeded to drop and break both of them. I chose this phone on whim after dropping my lg 3. Obviously durability was at the top of my list. I know that I am sometimes not a quick learner. I am not the only one, however. My expectations for this phone have really been exceeded . I love how fast this phone is. Android 5.1.1 is wonderful. I also love the near stock android skin. Compared to my lg 3 this phone just does everything more smoothly. Lg's android skin was annoying, overbearing, and laggy in comparison. Apps on the dt2 are easy to disable or uninstall. Nothing distracts from the experience. It's just surprisingly straightforward and simple. I did not know what I was missing. Other high points to note are durability. I have dropped this with and without an otterbox case. No problems. I have spilled an entire cup of coffee on the phone (with case and glass screen protector). No problem. The phone is tough. The camera works great in most situations. I love the twist your wrist twice function to launch the camera app. Here is one drawback to the phone. The low light photography is really an issue. I compared it to a Samsung s6 in a low light situation. Samsung's s6 was noticeably better. The amoled display my not be as nice as the leading competition but it is still a great display and does not disappoint. The battery life is exceptional. It seems like it lasts three times as long as my previous phone. I disabled a bunch of apps and turned the screen brightness down. Battery easily gets me through one day but not two. The moto notification may be my favorite feature. Just wave your hand over the phone and the clock comes up with other notifications too. This is without waking the whole screen. Very cool. I would miss the a lot if I got another phone. Lastly, my advice to phone buyers is this. Base your decision on your preferences. The consumer is king in the phone buyer arena. There are all kinds of wonderful products out there. I simply cannot believe how much better this phone is from my first smartphone. If durability, battery life, and near stock android ui are at the top of your list this phone is an awesome choice. If you are looking for the most beautiful design and the best camera there are probably some better choices. This phone gets knocked down in some reviews for the bloatware and it's bulk. I think those are minor concerns for the piece of mind I get for knowing I will not break it when I drop it.",19.0,Motorola,"Motorola XT1585 Turbo 2, (32GB) 5.4'' (White, Verizon)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1585-Turbo-White-Verizon/dp/B0192XJ0P6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uo-nK+OAL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,2.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0192XJ0P6,289,0.0,0.0
5269,B00OZTSY6Y,Techguru,4,7-Jan-15,True,I'm uber-passionate about all things tech that I use and this is the best Android phone out right now. Here's why...,"4.5 stars. Phone is everything I expected it to be. I typically spend six months or more researching my next device that I will hold onto for 2+ years. After being tired of the design-flawed Touchwiz Samsung UI, I decided to return home to the mostly Android stock experience and Motorola's light UI overlay; not to mention their superior cell and GPS radios. Plus, Verizon really goes all out for it's own Droid carrier specific devices. Being a grandfathered unlimited data slave to Verizon, I wanted the best offered at the best price. I was initially apprehensive about the capacitive buttons but hearing stories about on-screen button 'burn in' with the Nexus 6 and Moto X 2014, that is certainly not a bad thing and has been nicely done with no real feel of 'dated-ness'. Everything negative you have heard about this phone is most likely 'sour grapes' from someone on a different carrier. However, there is good news. This phone is GSM unlocked (thanks FCC) and therefore you can use it with other GSM carriers such as T-Mobile or AT&T by simply popping in their respective SIM cards. However, the one catch to that may be not all 4G LTE that other GSM carriers use may be supported by a strictly Verizon exclusive device. This also goes for international GSM 4G LTE carriers if you use the phone outside of the United States. The only negative that is of any consequence to me as a power user is the front-facing yet inadequate speaker for phone calls. In order to hear anyone on a phone call I either have to press my face up smugly against the phone (which I hate) or turn on speaker-phone, which at times can be inappropriate. No phone will ever check all an individuals user specific boxes, but being actual talking on the phone is becoming less and less a preference for many (myself included) this phone is the best Android device available at the moment. Pros: -Huge 3900 MAH Battery (I get no less than 18 hours with ultra-heavy use). -Motorola Turbo Charger (2%-3% To 100% in no time) -Beautiful but not over-saturated Quad HD Display. -Almost stock Android experience with enjoyable Motorola UI compliments. -You can disable or remove most of the un-wanted bloatware. -Now has calling and simultaneous data update! -The Camera is the best ever to be in any Motorola phone, including the Nexus 6 and Moto X 2014. -Rugid, masculine, ballistic nylon design (looks great and feels great in the hand!-first phone I've ever used without any case or screen protector! I recommend everyone see how great it really looks and feels before deciding to purchase or not). -No obnoxious Verizon branding. -Great deal $$$ for new or re-newing Verizon customers considering top of the line specs. Cons: -No removable SD card storage (64 GB version negates this slightly; removable storage becoming less of the norm overall). -Ear phone speaker is inadequate unless using the speaker phone. Meh: -Still waiting for Android 5.0 Lollipop.",24.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

I've liked the iPhone, blackberry and other Android powered devices as they each had something great about them. But this phone by far is my favorite. The 4.1Jelly Bean operating system is smooth and much more feature packed than any phone I've ever owned. The best two features are the battery and screen design. I make 20-25 calls a day and about 3000 text messages a month, on top of countless emails and I get through an entire day without charging again. This is absolutely amazing for me as I never have to worry about my phone dying around 5PM like I did with other phones. The screen is sharp and big enough for whatever you need on a phone. The edge to edge design makes the overall size of the phone feel smaller and lightweight and fits great in my hand, even though the screen is large. And although I do not use it much, for what its worth, being able to talk and surf web, etc at the same time is amazing. Just removes one little thing that always kind of annoyed myself and other Verizon Wireless customers I've talked to. If you are looking to upgrade to an Android device or switch to one, there are more expensive phones that have slightly larger and better technical numbers but in my experience do not actually do more for you.

You get one notification on the screen when you initially get a message. Then nothing. There is no led on the front that lights up every so often until the message is dealt with and the Moto app that is supposed to fade the screen in and out to notify you does not do so. Assistance from Motorola just says ’sorry'. So as long as you don't want to know you have messages that may or may not need your attention it's great. Very little bloat in the phone. Does all the things the other phones do at a reasonable price. Seems like such a ridiculous oversight regarding the notifications...

The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow.

7173,B0192XJ0P6,Heather Wilson,2,6-Oct-17,True,Great phone and deal. But....,"I spent two weeks looking for the phone I wanted. I stumbled onto the Droid Turbo 2 and fell in love with all it had to offer. I previously a year or 2 ago, ordered a phone from Amazon. A Galaxy Note 4 to be precise. Looked great, worked flawlessly, nicely packaged and quickly delivered. This time I ordered the Turbo 2. Once again packaged nicely, came in quickly, looked great besides a small scuff. But it is a refurbished phone so it's not going to be perfect. I unboxed it, put my sim and sd card in which both worked as they should with the phone. Drove 20 minutes to get my son from school (never touching the phone). Before I left it was on 97%. When I picked up my phone as I pulled in the parking lot it was on 68%. I was disappointed because this phone was supposed to have an amazing battery life. I've done everything from hard resetting it, clearing the cache, removing apps, etc. The only thing I can figure is it has a rotten battery. Disappointed to say the least as what's the point of having a phone that won't stay charged no longer than a few hours without even touching it...what can I do? Who can I contact? I love the phone but something has to give with the battery. Update..now the phone constantly shuts off and won't come back on.

14581,B072ZWCKP5,Joe,2,6-Oct-17,True,Verizon can't do simultaneous Voice call and use data,"I'm updating my review from a 5 to a 2 because I cannot get voice and data to work at the same time. If you are on Verizon and expect to use data and voice at the same time you should look at another phone. This means you can't make a call and surf the web or use a an app that needs Verizon's 4G LTE network. If I ever get this to work, I'll post instructions and up my rating. I've spent 3 hours trying to enable Verizon's HD Voice, Advanced Calling feature that would enable simultaneous voice and data. Your support option for Lenovo is their community forum which referred me to Verizon. I spent an hour on the phone with Verizon. Some people post that a prepaid version of this phone has no problem doing Advanced Calling. Anyway, I'm really frustrated and seems I can't find the right support to resolve. My original review a month after buying..... Still great after a month! Verizon compatible. My first smart phone and it seems easy to learn. Features continue to amaze me and a reasonable price. I'm giving it a five for a great combination of features at a great low price. The battery is lasting me 3 days between charges. I think that is amazing. This IS compatible with Verizon. Signal strength on this phone has been great. Two weeks after buying my phone, I bought another for my better half. I saved money by buying a two pack of screen protectors. I'm have not yet used the camera much but seems just fine for me. The phone as a great help app that walks you through all the features. This is time well spent so you can get the most from your device. Now some advice regarding using this phone which IS compatible with Verizon. Be aware that there are INDEPENDENT Verizon Stores and company owned ones. My independent store told me that this model was not compatible and I should return it and buy a phone from them. I received the hard sell. Politely ask for a free 4G LTE SIM card and leave. Verizon can also mail you a SIM card for a small fee. Verizon DOES allow you to bring your own phone. Call the Verizon Technical Support line for assistance and they will walk you through the whole process.

3998,B00K0NS0P4,J & G,4,6-Oct-14,True,Excellent value for money,"I've only had the phone for a week, so the usual caveats apply (phones slow down with age and bloat, and I'll probably found more stuff not to like with time). However, so far I'm very pleased. This phone replaced a Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, which is from the same generation and is comparable in price (a bit more expensive in fact), and is mostly an improvement. Pros: - Fast and responsive: I don't do anything super-taxing (3D-heavy gaming etc.), but everything is snappy. Transition that took 5-7 seconds on my old phone take a second now; unlocking is essentially instantaneous; rebooting is quick. - Much, much better reception than my S3. I used to get at most one bar at work (T-Mobile), and now I consistently get 3-4. - Micro SD card. This was one big problem about the S3 mini, because 8GB of storage (5.5GB usable) don't get you very far. - 4G LTE support (the S3 mini had only 3G HSPDA+). To be honest, that's not a big thing for me, but if you like to stream video it can be helpful. - Newer Android version. Google (which owns Motorolla) decided to make a point of keeping the OS on this phone pretty up-to-date. - Somewhat better camera, especially in low light. It's not a great camera, but it's faster, and has a good burst mode. - Really good grip. Cons: - Heavy. I don't like feather-weight phones, because they feel flimsy. However, holding this phone for a long time literally tires my wrist. - I miss the control panel at the top of the notification drawer on the Samsung. The stock Android control panel takes one more click to get to, and doesn't have everything I need (e.g. rotation control). There might be some 3rd-party app that provides that functionality, but I just haven't had the time to look for one. - When you take a photo, there's no easy way to do anything with it, e.g. share, delete, or even find it in the gallery. I might be missing something but that's quite annoying. All in all, I'm very happy about the purchase.

While it's a decent phone for the price ($200) it has it's drawbacks. Coming from the Moto G4 I thought I would have a good experience with the Moto G6. Good: Camera is decent. Battery life is nice. Screen looks good. Front Facing Speaker is always nice. Bad: Cell/Data Service along with WiFi intermittently stop working. Bluetooth is also spotty as it has it's issues with connecting/staying connected. I've worked with Motorola Support on the issues and they suggested ""reset network settings"" which I did multiple times and it did not resolve the issues. I've ""reset back to factory"" and that did not resolve the issues either. They said that I could send them back my ""defective"" phone and they would send me a replacement but I've heard others who report the same issues with replacement phones. So I chose just to deal with the issues instead of going through that process. From my research I believe it's the antenna's (possibly placement? weak overall?) that cause the issue. I feel that's why others are reporting the same thing when they get a replacement phone.

The answer is yes, but it didn't happen very smoothly for me. I was not able to take the active micro SIM from my Galaxy S5 and activate the Moto G, which should have worked. After several tries, referencing feedback on Moto G blogs, calls and visits to VzW stores, it was suspected that I had a bad SIM slot, but not before at least 2 VzW Reps questioned if it's even compatible on their network. I returned the phone to Amazon, received a replacement and took the new, unboxed phone straight to VzW. (Corp store where they provide free SIM cards.) My thought was to give it one more try. If it really wasn't compatible with their network, so be it. The VzW Rep opened the box, inserted a new micro SIM card; it activated right away. Solid connectivity to their LTE network. The phone has been great up to this point. I read several reviews before making the purchase. I was using the Galaxy S5 for a couple of years on VzW under contract and, while I really didn't have many issues with that phone, decided to try something different since I was eligible for an upgrade. I wasn't in the market to spend a whole lot of money; a couple of hundred dollars (or less) is about my speed for a smartphone. Reviews (like ""CNET best phones of 2016"") pointed to the Moto G being a good, less pricey model to go with. This is a personal phone, so I don't know how much of a work horse it is for people who want to use it for business. Worth the money, but be wary of the issues that ""could"" happen when trying to activate it with VzW.

26218,B07WSJYDXX,FR,3,6-Mar-19,True,Excellent phone for the price,"I was very optimistic in getting the Moto G6. It has all the bells and whistles you see in a high end smartphone and more: fingerprint and face sensor to unlock, powerful front and back camera. Moto gestures are also very helpful like 2 shakes turn on the flashlight and you can also customize how you want it to function by shakes and gestures. All being said, the battery disappointed me. May be it comes with a turbo charger which charges very fast, but battery bleeds out fast too. After getting the phone & charging it to 100%, I turned it on to browse - no SIM card, no Wi-Fi - just to get the feel of it. In 7 minutes, 2% charge gone and some might say that the phone was searching for network & so depleted quick. I tried the same with a brand new LG model of similar configuration and the battery was much more robust. The Moto G kept discharging until I switched it to airplane mode. After inserting SIM card, registering Wi-Fi, updates started and after 45-50 minutes, the phone was finally ready to use. Battery was down to 56% and I didn't like it. Earpiece volume at maximum seemed low and I am NOT deaf. Proximity sensors are hypersensitive; if you snap your fingers 6 inches away from the phone, the display will come on. Zoomed shots cracked up and there was no way to fix it.

They are affordable and good quality. Though on this one I wish I'd gone for the G7. Unfortunately when I called Verizon they told me it was not currently supported on their CDMA network at this time. I didn't want to risk buying the phone to find I had connection issues as I travel all over the country and always buy unlocked phones. My advise would be wait for the 7 if your on Sprint or Verizon.

22660,B07N9M9FX4,L. J. Klein,5,6-Jul-19,True,An amazing value for a smartphone,"I've had this phone for about a month now, and am thoroughly impressed with Motorola's effort. I've been a Samsung fanboy for years (my first Android smartphone was a Samsung, and I've had a succession of Galaxy S phones over the years), and this was my first non-Samsung Android smartphone. I was prepared to be underwhelmed. I was NOT prepared to enjoy this phone as much as I have! PROS: *Despite being LCD, rather than AMOLED, the expansive screen impresses. It's plenty bright, even in sunlight, and at FHD resolution it's not the power drain that QHD or 4k screens are. *The performance of the SoC is very impressive for a midrange phone. Graphical performance is good, but where the phone shines is app responsiveness. Taps incur no delay, and app switching is immediate. *It ships with the latest version of Android (Pie), including support for gesture based navigation (which is a feature I've grown to love). *The built in speaker is louder than anything that tiny has any right to be, and has impressive clarity and bass for being so tiny. Don't get me wrong: it's no substitute for a full-sized speaker or a good pair of headphones, but for casual listening or sharing a song with a group of friends, it's more than adequate. *The fingerprint reader is amazingly convenient, both in placement and accuracy. *TurboPower charging is fabulous! *MicroSD card slot. CONS: *Battery life could be better. I use my phone heavily throughout the day for audio streaming and navigation, and have to charge it once or twice in a day. *For those who like to tinker under the hood, the Developer options are not readily available. *The fact that the battery is not replaceable by the user was the biggest obstacle I had to overcome in deciding to purchase this phone, but considering that's the direction the entire industry is going, whatcha gonna do? I haven't used the camera much (and am not much of a photographer), but the snaps I have taken have been decent. BOTTOM LINE: If you're a shutterbug, you might want to look elsewhere, but if you're just looking for a phone with good performance that won't even cost you three bills, check out the Moto G7!",4.0,Motorola,"Moto G7 – Unlocked – 64 GB – Ceramic Black (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, Metro",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-G7-Unlocked-Warranty-T-Mobile/dp/B07N9M9FX4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7177TyBRVnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N9M9FX4,66,0.0,0.0
22516,B07N91S9MW,Russ K,3,6-Jul-19,True,Not what I expected,"I am marginally happy with this smart phone. The first one I bought the screen cracked on the 2nd day and I am not sure why. Not impressed with the Gorilla Glass. I returned immediately and Amazon being a good company shipped me out a new one. I use Cricket so I had to notify them with the new IMEI #, no big deal. There are three issues that I have: 1- Gorilla Glass Screen how will it be months from now? I did put a screen protector on with a phone case as well. 2- Battery life is not as good as my MOTO 4G was. I was happy with the 4G but battery was not good it would shut down showing 60% life left. I could have replaced the battery, but it was over 3 years old. So I went with the 7. 3-Phone antennae is somewhat weak in the area that I live, where as the MOTO 4G was much better on the fringes. The speed of the phone is fast., and I don't experience any wi-fi connection issues. When I am on the road 4G works well with GPS feature on Google Maps. I am just not certain whether to stay with this smart phone. I have a few more days to go before I can no longer send it back to Amazon and look for something that isn't MOTO. 7/14/19 Now the MOTO 7 will not connect to my router. I have restarted the phone several times entered my password for the router and it states check password and try again. All my other devices are working but not this phone on wi-fi.

5277,B00OZTSY6Y,Ryguy,3,6-Jul-15,False,Pretty Basic besides the Battery,"TL;DR - Pretty standard phone - Great battery with really great charging feature - Slow at times with certain applications and bad call quality. I highly suggest the LG G4 over this (only reason I didnt get it was because I got this for free) This is a pretty basic phone for whats out there today. I had the LG G2 which I feel was just as fast, if not faster than this phone. It even held a charge just as well as the Turbo. The one thing that sets this phone aside is the Turbo Charge. Its truly amazing how fast it charges up (although I do feel that will kill the battery quicker as batteries can only hold so many charges) The notifications are really cool. If you get a text, you can just swipe your screen to dismiss it. You can also hold down on the icon to see a preview of the text. Another feature thats actually really handy is when you go to reach for your phone, it lights up. Super handy. So instead of pressing the power button to see if you have messages, you just wave your hand in front of it to turn the screen on. Pros: Turbo Charger Pretty decent Speaker Phone 3GB RAM Notfications are handy Decent Display Texting app work very well with lots of great features Cons: Battery can run upwards of 110 Degrees Fahrenheit Processing speed doesn't seem that fast at times Camera seems OK but not great (Snapchat videos seem to come out choppy - could be the application and not the phone) Autobrightness really does not work well The call quality really stinks - volumes not loud at all",7.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0
5305,B00OZTSY6Y,Michael Elias,1,6-Jul-15,False,This phone has to be one of the worst phones I have ever had in my life,"After my recent experiences with the Motorola Droid Turbo 64 gigabyte phone, I have come to a conclusion. This phone has to be one of the worst phones I have ever had in my life. This phone not only lived up to what everyone already says about droid phones, It exceeded those expectations. At first sight the phone was not the worst phone on the market, but over time it became the worst choice that I could possibly have chosen. The phone not only locked up on me, but my wireless carrier actually threw this phone on me and said this is what you could have and only this. When I first went to Verizon wireless to purchase a new phone they told me I had two options: either get the Droid Turbo or wait until my regular upgrade was available. After wanting a phone and listening to the reviews at the time I decided to try it. IT WAS THE WORST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!!! After having the phone for about 3 months I knew it was bad. The phone started to freeze on me, shut off uncontrollably, and make me miss important phone calls and text messages when I needed them the most. You need a phone that is reliable, not one that will decide when it wants to work or not. Hopefully if you own one of these phones you do not have these problems. In my experience with Motorola phones in general I have realized that this happens more often than not. Always, makes sure to read the product reviews and do your research before you sign your life away on a cell phone contract for 2 years. That is not something that you would want to do. Once, you realize or come to a realization of which phone suits you the most, go with your first instinct and get that phone. In conclusion, I would not recommend this phone at all. Due to its inconsistencies and unreliability when you are counting on your phone to work the most. When the time comes, which phone would you choose? The one not recommended by someone who has had it, or the phone that everybody else is getting but it is reliable in the end? That is the real question.",4.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

4510,B00MWI4KKE,Johann Cat,4,6-Jan-16,True,"Efficient, Well-built and Clever; Lacks SD card slot or a Good Camera","This is a good phone, but know its limitations and your usages. I know at this point I am speaking to people looking for a slightly ""old,"" < $200 phone. You could do worse than the Moto X. This is optimized for phone use; this 16gb item is not a proxy tablet or a hand-held entertainment center. The ""feel"" is high-end in the phone's weight/balance, materials, and rigidity. The software is nice. As many reviews point out, this is basically a no-BS, stock, android with a very few and almost always clever and useful accessories (like a minimalist, motion sensitive lockscreen; a twist-to-activate camera; and Motorola-tweak for using OK Google to operate the phone, make calls, etc.). It has one front-facing speaker, which I think is smart. It has the best speaker-sound I have ever heard in a phone; great for speaker-phone use. (Oddly, the conventional receiver speaker may be below average, or just not volume-optimized; it is weak at max volume, even). The phone's drawbacks are a) it has no SD card, and Marshmallow [the OS] takes up 6gb of the hard drive. This means that if you have a few apps on the phone that are sizable, you will likely store photos or music on a cloud or micro SD stick. That doesn't sound onerous, but it could be, and most apps will not read directly, except in very limited ways, from an accessory card or cloud. You would need to move files onto the native drive, and then move them back to conserve space, etc. and: b) The camera is fine in broad daylight--but only in broad, blazing daylight or super-close flashes of still-life circumstances. People are not nit-pickling when they criticize this camera. Under the best of circumstances, it composes images of Georges Seurat-like impressionist blobs. Indoor photography is hit-or-miss, and usually a miss; the Moto X camera struggles to focus or attain light balance and surprisingly the camera takes almost no advantages of flash (?!) to correct its low-light, indoor difficulties; one indoor shot out of four will look ""pretty good"" but I can do nothing to control this outcome. But if you only take close-up flash shots or outside sunshine shots, it is still functional and acceptable. I tried using other camera software, and the original equipment software seems best. The Moto locks down ISO and exposure time settings, in any case, so that no software can control those features (my old LG-G2, which sadly developed crazy-screen syndrome, allowed these adjustments from the start). I like the saturated colors on the screen--on a bigger screen (tablet or bigger), I likely wouldn't, but this painterly, color-popping screen is an audacious detail to put on the phone. I think it's cool, but one dubious benefit of the saturated screen is that it makes the camera's sketchy work seem much better than it will on a large, normally saturated and balanced screen. Bottom line: great feeling, great looking, minimalist phone; reasonably fast processor. Don't get the 16gb model if you have many music or image files to store: no SD card. The camera is weak.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) XT1097 GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4KKE,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HfPVitlfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4KKE,428,0.0,0.0

I did like the phone, I knew that I liked it before ordering it. A friend of mine bought one but only uses wifi calling (google) and video calling over wifi but he does not have a cell plan/carrier. I ordered the phone despite reading reviews that it was not supported with US cell service as some folks claim they did get good LTE signal (and some did not). I found a few sites that listed supported bands by phone and was very nervous that it appeared that NONE of the LTE bands could be found in the US with ATT (my carrier). Again, not sure how others were able to get LTE service, maybe those sites were wrong? I have no idea. I was nervous, as I had already ordered my phone. My friend (smart thinking) told me to try his phone with my sim card from my Moto 5G.

9694,B01LEL8ABY,elzilio,5,6-Dec-16,True,Almost perfect,"I’ve been a Motorola owner since the original Moto X in 2013. I switched from the Galaxy S3 because the X offered features I really cared about, not useless gimmicks. The Moto Z thankfully continues that idea with legitimately innovative mods. First the design; whenever I first see a new Moto phone, I think, “My God thats ugly! Why would they change what works?” But then I actually start using the phone and that opinion changes. The Moto Z is (in my opinion) one of the most beautiful smartphones ever made, right up there with the iPhone 4 and HTC One M7. The glass and aluminum feels just as good as the Galaxy S6 and the style shells you can get for it provide that customization Motorola is famous for. However, I must admit, I hate the way the front of the phone looks. The giant fingerprint sensor combined with huge top and bottom bezels with NO stereo speakers is a step back from something they've been doing since 2014. I really wish the fingerprint scanner could have been placed on the back or made smaller, anything. As for the rest of the hardware, there is unfortunately no headphone jack. I personally don't mind this since I use bluetooth, but its disappointing that its gone. The phone is crazy thin and that makes it feel unique without feeling fragile. (look up bend tests to see what I mean). The camera hump is huge and annoying, but putting a style shell fixes that. The screen is one of the best I've ever seen, only surpassed by the S7. I wish wireless charging came standard without Moto mods, but thats probably not a big deal for most people. The software is simply put, the best Android has ever been. (I haven't used the Pixel so I can't comment on that). As many others have said, “This phone does Android better than Google” and they're right. Features like Moto Display and Moto Voice have become things I've really got used to over the years, and the gestures like the quick camera launch should be on every phone. It’s also super slick and responsive, as stock Android usually is, and its nice to already have Nougat. The camera is great by Motorola standards, good by all else. It takes a while to focus and tends to overexpose in certain scenes, and low light is just not on par with the iPhone 7 or S7. In well lit areas, it performs well, with my only issues being a little bit of over sharpening on edges and some digital noise. The camera software on the other hand is far better than previous Moto phones. There are more controls available with a manual mode included. 4K video is included, but I don't have a 4K screen so I just stick to 1080p, which can be shot either at 30FPS HDR or 60FPS regular. Slo-mo is included with 720P at 120FPS, which kinda sucks. The iPhone 7 can shoot at 240FPS and has time-lapse modes as well. I'm sure these can be added with updates, but there's no guarantee of that. The Moto Mods are a great idea, but a little expensive. I love the idea of being able to add functionality to the phone “in a snap”, but they really do require an investment. I bought a battery and the camera mods shortly after the phone, and they do come in handy. (I have full reviews of both products on my profile) Using the mods is dead simple. You snap them on the back and they instantly connect and react, it just works. Some fun ideas for Moto mods might be something that can dock your phone so you could use it like a computer, a game controller, or how about a solar charger on the back? Battery life is OK. If you aren't using it too heavily, you'll end the day with 10-15%. You won't get two days out of it, at least without Mods. Overall, I’m happy with this phone. I wish it had a better camera and battery along with some design changes, but I can’t deny how well it does other things. The mods perfectly integrated into the main experience and the software is quick and responsive with some fun features.

1332,B0096QYH80,joemaamah,5,6-Aug-13,True,"So far, so good.","I upgraded to this from a Droid X2, and other than the raping Verizon put on my butt with their 4G data ""plan"" (PLAN to pay a h@ll of a lot more!!)I've been very pleased with the upgrade. At first I thought the phone seemed kind of flimsy compared to the X2, which was a tank. But now that I've had a chance to break this in, I must say it is a lot tougher than it looks thanks to the gorilla glass and Kevlar case. I use this in a lot of areas that are out in the sticks, and except when I am in the deepest, darkest jungles of South Carolina, I always have enough signal to get out a call or stream in some Pandora. The sound on this phone is head and shoulders better than the X2. It still suffers a touch from Motorola's penchant to overemphasize the high end. But at least it doesn't sound shrill and tinny like the X2 did. It is quite listenable even with flat equalization. A little tweaking can make it sound great on a good sound system. I'd suggest springing for a 32G micro SD card, you'll likely be loading up your library to this thing very quickly. When I did mine, I found that the micro USB connection was pretty fast with my Class 10 card, which was a pleasant surprise. I filled the card up in no time. A highlight is the fine display on this phone. It's not quite full HD, but streaming Netflix programs I couldn't really notice the difference. One caveat I found about this phone is the lack of an HDMI port. But then in the years I had the X2 I think maybe I used it twice, so I can't even justify taking a half star off for that. Colors are very vibrant under normal lighting conditions. It is tough to see the display in very strong sunlight, though. Not really irritating enough to dock a star, but it can be troublesome if you are trying to navigate somewhere with the GPS. And so far the GPS has been flawless. I can't say the same about previous Motorola products I've owned, where the chip had a nasty tendency to cook itself to death. The main camera on the phone is pretty decent and will do a fine job for day to day picture taking. If you are some kind of artiste, you might find some minor faults in the color representation, but I hardly think the average joe like me is going to notice anyway. Haven't played with the front facing camera yet, so can't comment there. The phone did not come with Android 4.1 (it came with 4.0) but as soon as I activated it, 4.1 was immediately downloaded without a hitch. I was pleasantly surprised that a lot of older apps still run without a hitch, although one of my favorites was squashed by Google, not Android itself. Another issue, but not worth docking the phone, is the huge assortment of Bloatware Motorola and Google insist on sticking in this thing. I wouldn't mind so much, except that you can't uninstall this crap without rooting the phone. Totally uncalled for. So other than minor quibbles, I have to say that I have been pleased with the performance of the phone itself. If we only could get someone to do something about the avaricious nature of the Verizon data plans, so I can tap the full capacity of the 4G experience.",5.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0
62,B002UHS0UI,1111,1,6-Aug-13,True,Junk,"Bought this phone used (but claimed to be refurbished), and it was supposed to be fully tested and functional. It is not. First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned.

26210,B07WSJYDXX,Amazon Customer,2,6-Apr-19,True,"Great phone, but if u have the money get better","Update: So this phone is very sluggish and by what I can tell it's because Moto has there own ""assistant"" that helps with stuff.. this fights with the Google built in one (""ok Google commands) the worst part is even though it's a stock phone it will not let you change basic apps to be default. This became a big issue when I noticed the sensor for proximity (so when it tells ur phone it's close to ur face) does not work so well.. so u end up muting ur calls all the time and don't know till someone tells u they can't hear u... Or they hang up. I tried to download a basic phone app to fix this ... And it will not make it defult even though it says it is. Also once the new Android version dropped I had alot of issues with apps not showing on the lock screen (which Moto has there own version.. that also blocks random things) After about 4 months , I dropped the phone for the first time, with a case on.. and it shattered the screen. I found out Moto fuses the screen to the glass.. so the only way to fix it is to pay about 70-90 to have the whole screen replaced. I decided to save up and just buy a new phone from a different company since that's almost how much I paid for the full phone.. This is gonna be a long review... Fair warning First off ignore the person who said they received one with a screen protector on. That was not a screen protector, it's just packaging for shipment, it peels off easy. Also the phone is very easy to get fingerprints, and had a coating to make it ""water reistent"" which makes the phone look a bit dirty if u are not carefull Camera: decent, not very good pics in the dark but its a phone under 150 so... Screen: very good, photos look good and works well for videos System: the phone currently uses Android 8.0 it is supposed to upgrade to 9.0 but there is no release date for when that will happen in the u.s. Put a family mobile sim card in and it booted up very quickly My phone came with the laungaue set as cevez republic I just scrolled down the list and found English. Moto is sold the most in Brazil (they already got the 9.0 Android update also) so I can understand it not being a English defult. Because Moto has ""Moto motions"" if you want to set a lock screen background you must use a 3ed party app as Moto did not include it in settings to try and make people use Moto motions. Some Moto actions are really handy tho. You can ""chop"" the phone to get the flashlight without turning on the phone screen. Also the fingerprint reader can be used as a way to not have the navagation bar on screen but still have the access The fast charge also works well, phone came with only 50% battery and it was only about 20 mins to get to full battery Cons: the phone does not have wireless charging even tho the phone has a glass body, which seems a shame to increase the chance of breaking without a benefit Also no nfc. This seemed to be a basic feature in modern phones so not sure why it's not on this one :/ Fingerprint reader has a logo above it, which seems dumb as it made the fingerprint reader smaller The battery is also small. It's only 3,000 which is samller then my old phone (lg Stylo 3 with 3,200 ) but honestly the battery seems to not die real quick , however it's also not a very good battery just basic. I did let it run all day and as long as ur not watching Netflix or playing games all day it should last last a full day. If u turn off Moto display it will last alot longer. MOST IMPORTANTLY: this phone is VERY slippery. Like as in holding it is a pain and if it is on any incline it will slip off. It's basicly like holding a fish covered in oil. Trust me buy a case when you buy the phone. All I all it's a great phone it was a great value for 150 and if you buy phones out right and don't wanna spend alot it's perfect",3.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

9781,B01LEL8ABY,Kevin J. Fehr,5,5-Oct-16,True,From A Moto Man!,"Motorola has been through it all, and when they were on the down-slide, they hit a homerun with their Moto X brand. Yes, the devices didn't sell so hot...but android purists take a special liking to ""X"" phones as the software is TOP TOP TOP notch. Welcome Moto Z...it's a Moto X, and more! Also...it's more money, but it's probably worth, just not to everyone! The software is Moto, the design...Motorola influenced! With that, if you are looking for a premium device, THIS is a premium device. Sure, you might not like the fingerprint reader layout, the buttons are high (hard to reach), and the famous Moto dimple is no more...but this is still a fantastic build. The wood panels also feel fantastic and complement the device very well while holding it. The device comes with a back panel, just so you know! Oh yes...no mic jack. GET OVER IT. All manufactures have said that they will soon not support 3.5 jacks. The software is incredible. Do you have a car bluetooth? Yes? This phone will be your BEST friend while driving. Flawless voice commands that are the best on the market. Texting by voice alone has never been so easy. What Moto adds to stock android is incredible. Why can't other manufacturers do this??? Moto mods. Mine are coming in the mail. I've used them. Yes, they are too expensive. The battery pack might be worth it and the speaker to some. If you buy the projector...you must have kids or have money to burn! I can't wait to see what else they come up with for mods, but the so far they are too pricey and don't meet up to most people's expectations. Keep in mind, on the JBL, you can adjust the bass up a bit more if bass is your thing. Do this through the EQ on the phone. The Battery. It's good, just not great. This will last MOST users all day, with 10% to spare at bedtime. It's not bad. I'm guessing that 7.0 will increase battery life some. Also, turn on battery saver and the battery saver for the individual apps. This does help. If you are an average user, the battery won't disappoint, but it won't be a major plus either. This is really a 4.5 device. It's a great start for mod devices and i can't wait to see what the Moto line has in store in the future. The best ideas in android are with Moto. From software to these mods, Motorola is continuing major steps in the right direction. Plus + Build Quality (9/10) Mods (great idea...too expensive) Screen (above average) Fingerprint scanner off/on function (Works wwway better than Samsung on the S7) Great Simple Camera Software (Thank You) Best android software experience Moto Voice can ACTUALLY help you Middle Camera (best from moto, middle of the road in the industry) Battery (should get you through the day) Whites (A little too blue) Volume Buttons (wwway up there!)

The X had superior call quality and the M continues this trait with call quality you would think the person is in the room. The battery life was decent on the X but the Razr M's is amazing. Even in the first two days of owning the new phone (so I am playing with it constantly) I have only charged it at night when I go to bed still at around 20%. But probably the most impressive thing about this phone is its durability. It just feels like I could throw it in a river from 50 yards and it would come out fine. I dropped it like a fool the first day I got it in a parking lot, and there is absolutely not visible damage. Great phone and I cannot wait for Jelly Bean! Update: Now I have owned this phone for about 9 months and wanted to give a quick update now. The phone is still as durable as I mentioned above, still looks like the day I took it out of the box. I am noticing a few issues however. I enjoyed a long (about 15 hrs on normal use) battery life with ICS but now with the Jelly Bean update some days I am usually lucky to only get 8 hours of battery life on very gentle use.

9815,B01LEL8ABY,BTB44,5,5-Nov-16,False,It is a great phone. DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"Motorola/Lenovo is not prepared to support this phone in any way. Their Moto Care accident protection, which is advertised on the literature that comes with the phone, is still not available. If you purchase your phone directly from Motorola it is now available. However, for anyone that bought their phone before that was an option, it is still not available. So, and Amazon may correct me here, if you buy it from Amazon you'll have no way to purchase Moto Care. This is not in any way a knock against Amazon since it is not their fault. I don't even like writing this review here since I love Amazon, but I think everyone considering purchasing this phone should know about it. Maybe it will even force Motorola to work harder and fixing this. It took over two months to make Moto Care available to people at the time they purchase it. I continue to ask on their support forum for updates on when it will be available post-purchase and the only response I have seen is, ""Moto Care is now available for Moto Z (non-Droid versions) at the time of device purchase. We're still working on post-sales purchase, but this is progress, anyway!"" So, as far as I can tell by talking to customer service and on the forum, if I happen to break my phone I am stuck with the full repair bill or wait, with a broken phone, for Moto Care to become available. That is assuming they will still let me purchase it when/if it does become available. With the lack of customer service I have seen so far, I wouldn't be surprised if they tell me that I have had the phone for too long for Moto Care to be available for purchase. I have a reference number for when I called customer service about this, within 30 days of purchasing the phone, but if it takes two more months to get this fixed I will seriously doubt that the reference number will matter. Again, this is not Amazon's fault. In fact, I wish I would have purchased the phone through Amazon. Amazon's customer service has always been fantastic and they would probably do something to rectify the situation if someone was to break their phone before Moto Care is available, but there is no way to know for sure.

I am a light user - a typical day is about 5 texts, 1-5 short phone calls, and maybe 30 mins of web apps. Doing that, I can use the Moto E between 3 and 5 days before it needs a charge. That's incredible. I haven't had that kind of battery life since my flip phone. There's lots more to like. The phone has been responsive, if not lightning quick. The Motorola notification screen is a real improvement over stock android. As a former Samsung user, I am very apprehensive of the junk phone manufacturers put on, but Motorola has added some genuine improvements. I like the size of the phone - I need my phone to fit in my pocket, rather than having a movie screen with me at all times. It's pretty well built, and supposedly water resistant. I haven't tested that, but it's good to know. And, at $99, it's a bargain. I use it on Ting, so the low purchase price and bills of around $25 a month make this a very affordable proposition. There are some downsides, though. There's no flash for the camera, which means no flashlight apps.

122,B002UHS0UI,farmgirl,1,5-Nov-11,True,I feel duped,"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",10.0,Motorola,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver,https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Wireless-Motorola-RAZR-V3m/dp/B002UHS0UI,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pVtPaTkML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,2.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B002UHS0UI,208,0.0,0.0

259,B002WTC1NG,Old Slappy Mc Gee,4,5-May-10,True,"SIMPLE? YES, RUGGED? Meh... Not so much. Good reception.","Motorola Barrage - MOTV860 UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER: Alright, so maybe this isn't such a bad phone after all. It is VERY simple and it STILL gets great reception compared to other verizon phones I've had. I still wouldn't call it rugged at all. But, for a penny- I think it is the best bet of all the 1 cent options, as it is still working great after 6 months and the fact that it weighs nothing and doesn't seem to contain any glass or metal as advertised has become less annoying as it has been consistently performing well. No problems since the early exchange for the dud. Maybe they just need to change their advertising angle as it isn't bad at all, but is NOT industrial grade. Because of it's consistently very high talk quality and ease of use, I have upped it a star. ____________________________ UPDATE: two months later... Returned the original phone because the screen kept going blank. Had no problems at Verizon with the exchange because it had been purchased within 30 days and have had no problems with the replacement phone. The reception is still VERY good and the Battery life long. But still... it is not a rugged phone by any stretch. There is no such thing as an industrial grade phone. Please Motorola, start making something in the USA! ----------------------------- Maybe this was designed to military specs, but it is just a cheap plastic phone... toy even. I don't know where the metal and glass is on this consumer version of what may have once been an industrial grade design. The hinge doesn't seem to be metal, it seems to be plastic although it could be aluminum or some other inexpensive and light metal. The screen doesn't seem to be glass, but plastic. screen goes completely white randomly, rendering it useless a good deal of the time. Don't know that it would survive even a 2 foot drop, since it didn't seem to make it through shipping without getting messed up. The product description is a joke compared to what was actually delivered. Looking for a rugged phone? Don't look to the Barrage unless appearances are all that matters. This phone should be heavy, it weighs nothing and feels cheap. I don't know that a truly rugged phone exists anymore. If Motorola won't make a quality product in the USA, there's no one that will. The only thing positive about this phone is that it does seem to get rather good reception when the screen isn't white. If Motorola wants to tout this phone as rugged, they need to use the original design components or change the description from metal and glass to thin plastic, made in China.

5331,B00OZTSY6Y,Jessica Crafton,5,5-Mar-15,True,"Great phone, great price.","The best phone I've ever had the pleasure to use. While not everything is perfect, it's just really, really good. First, a caveat: This phone has no removable battery, and no expandable memory. For me, that's fine. I don't need so much room as to require more storage, and I just hook up the phone to my laptop for transfers. As for the battery, the battery technology used allows for more juice in a smaller package, conforming to the phone's shape. This means you can't remove it, but it also keeps it from being huge. And a 3900 maH battery would normally be huge. Plus, these batteries aren't like what you're used to: they don't die after a year of use, and won't need to be replaced. If they do, the warranty will cover replacement of the phone. Now to the review: Performance: With a nearly bare-bones KitKat OS, this thing is snappy. With noTouchWiz or Sense or any other user interface on top of it, the phone just responds so quickly. With a top-tier CPU and GPU, there's nothing you can't do with this phone. It's consistently at the top of the benchmarks, and its 3GB RAM allows you to move along without having to keep shutting down other apps. Camera: Great pics - nice and sharp. I would have liked image stabilization, as well as a touch better low-light performance. Plus, the default camera app has a very slow response from the time you tap it to the time the picture is taken. Other camera apps don't exhibit such latency, so it's a software problem. Additionally, I can't for the life of me figure out how to change the resolution or compression schemes to make for file sizes more appropriate for sharing over text or social media. It's a beast of a camera, and the video is 1080p or better (720p on slow-motion), but how do you make it smaller without using a 3rd-party app? Disappointing, regardless of the quality of the snaps. Sound: Nice and loud, no background hiss or boominess. That said, it does break up a bit at high volumes. Call Quality: So far, it's better than my previous phones. My last phone was the HTC Droid DNA, and the Motorola DROID Turbo just sounds better. Battery: Around 1-2 days of battery life with mixed use. Quick charger is the real deal as well. Software: Motorola loves their Moto apps. And they ARE really useful. Unfortunately, they also seem to be inconsistent. Maybe it's just me. I personalized my phone so when I say ""Wake up, Chewie!"", it would be ready for my instructions. For example, when I say my phrase, it should beep (to tell me it's ready), and then I should be able to ask about last night's basketball game, or tell it to set an alarm. When it works, it's pretty cool. Unfortunately, it often ignores my phrase. I've changed it to something more normal, yet it makes no difference. It's not due to the way I say it, and it's not due to background noise. It's just inconsistent. That said, I like the fact that I can tell it I'm going to bed so it'll go silent. And that if I'm in a meeting, it'll respond to calls with a notification text saying so. When I'm in the car, it will read me my texts and allow full hands-free operation with no extra setup. I love that. When it works. So, bottom line: I love this phone. I want to love it more, but Motorola has some work to do on the software. Being a Verizon-only phone hurts it, as does the fact that Verizon still hasn't approved of an upgrade to Android 5.0+ (Lollipop) yet. That should happen soon. Maybe. Pros: Fast, good looking, sharp camera, loud, bare-bones OS, tremendous battery life Cons: No removable battery, no expandable memory. no image stabilization, some software quirks Recommendation: If you're on Verizon and want a new phone, this one's really worth the look.

22595,B07N91S9MW,FishWater,2,5-Jul-19,True,Great Potential with Poor design choices from Motorola.,"The Moto G7 really had potential to be a fantasic budget phone with it's nice ceramic design, nice 6.2 sceen size with teardrop notch and running on the latest stock Andriod Pie. I also love the Moto actions such as two small shakes to turn on flashlights(really useful) and turning your wrist twice quickly side to side to instantly get into camera. I use Mint/T-Mobile 4g LTE for my phone and it worked good with few connectivity issues. The downsides to this phone is the poor battery life even when compared to the Moto G6. The Moto G6 has a 5.7 size screen compared to the Moto G7 6.2, so the bigger the screen, the more battery will be in use. Motorola decided to give the G7 the same 3,000mAh battery capacity as the G6 and relies on the Android Pie's Adaptive Battery feature instead of increasing the Moto G7 battery capacity to atleast 3500mAh. The Moto G7 CPU is more power efficient than the Moto G6, but not enough to offset the smaller battery for it's screen size. Compared to the Moto G7 Play and Power, Motorola decided to remove Band 71 which is a great band for T-Mobile users in rural areas and is going to be a band that T-Mobile is going to use more of. It makes no sense to have Motorola's ""lesser"" G7 Play and Power to have this band and not the higher spec G7. Also, it takes too much brightness to get a solid display. The more brightness you use, the more battery will be in use. To be fair, it does look pretty good, but it should not take this much power.",2.0,Motorola,"Moto G7 – Unlocked – 64 GB – Ceramic Black (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, & Metro",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-G7-Unlocked-Warranty-T-Mobile/dp/B07N91S9MW,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Vobb06FVL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N91S9MW,361,179.99,299.99

22769,B07NP6R2RG,Cindy,5,5-Jul-19,False,Very pleased with my Moto G7!,"I purchased my Moto G7 via Google Fi. I originally had a Pixel 2 XL w/Google Fi, but it was stolen. Due to the price, I decided to go with the Moto G7. I was dreading getting a different phone b/c of the setup & learning period. Surprisingly, the Moto came with exactly the same menu as the Pixel. If I had not known better, I would have believed it was a Pixel. The only difference I have found in the two phones is the Pixel took better photos & was a tougher phone as far as screen scratching, cracking, etc. The first time I dropped the Moto G7 (before my case arrived) it shattered the screen. The Pixel was dropped a lot & used a lot. As the old TIMEX ads stated, “Takes a Licking and Keeps on Ticking” describes the Pixel. I paid $906.31 for the Pixel & ONLY $265.81 for the Moto G7. I could buy three (3) Moto G7s for $797.43 & have $100+ left over for basically the same phone. This is what sold me after reading all the reviews I could find on the Moto. My son is a gamer & he said the Moto G7 performs as well as the Pixel did. Both have 4GB RAM. I have only owned 2 smart phones, Samsung Galaxy S5 & Google Pixel 2 XL. The Galaxy was a pain b/c it had a mind of its own. Both my sons had the same S5 at the time. They would try to ""show"" me how to change settings, go to certain screens, etc. but soon figured out what I already knew....the phone was haunted. I nicknamed it ""My Smart(ass) Phone"".

I didn't have a mobile number (at the time) that I could use. I tried using the WI FI on my old phone to activate new one but didn't know how to activate the new phone while using the old one which was unlocked. So had to go somewhere to borrow a phone to call to Activate the phone. The 20 count number that was necessary to provide was ridiculously small. I was barely able to decipher it and missed a number when I was writing it down on a sheet of paper to make my life easier. I had to get an agent to help me and shortly after give the new provider the PIN and account number of my previous carrier to get authorization to keep my cell number. Took hours instead of minutes to get 1/2 things accomplished that should have taken under a half hour. Having a WI FI connection is vital or you can't do any of this. The feature that is supposed to detect you are looking at the screen must require a insane amount of light or it'll tell you it can't detect you and to please find better lighting. Sounded nice but having a timer on the device to shut itself off after so many minutes would have been nice and I don't know or think I have that option. I can't think of anything else other than to say that the instructions to create a split screen should be more specific.

5353,B00OZTSY6Y,Bengirlxd,5,5-Jan-15,False,The Best Phone You Can Get Right Now,"This is the best cell phone you can get right now. Period. Processing Power: The Unit uses the Snapdragon 805 processor which is the best one out right now clocked at 2.7 ghz. Navigation in this phone is smooth and buttery with Android Kitkat and is soon to have the new Lollipop update as well. The processor makes running programs a breeze and can handle even the most labor intensive apps out there. The Adreno 420 gpu is an absolute boss. Gaming with this little thing is amazing delivering good frame rate and I have not experienced any frame rate drops or hickups so far. The 3 gb of ram will allow you to seamlessly multitask between numerous apps without any delays in performance. The unit is a powerhouse. The Display: The Quad HD AMOLED display is beautiful and crisp. There are no noticeable backlight issues and the viewing angles are great. Using the phone out in sunlight is satisfactory and minimizes glare. The Camera: Though it is stated that the unit is 21 mp, I found the picture quality is mostly washed out. Also the camera app is bare bones and hardly allows for any type of customization. The front camera is extremely laggy in low lighting. I feel like this is a software issue but Motorola DEFINITELY needs to get this problem fixed as soon as possible. The Design: The phone is beautiful and the ballistic nylon adds a very nice touch to it. I love the feeling of holding the phone and it has a nice grip from the nylon which keeps it from slipping. Even though the unit is 5.2 inches, my tiny hands became adjusted to it very nicely. Battery Life: With the 3900 mAh battery you can expect this unit to go for a day and a half with no additional charge needed even with such a high pixel density screen and processor. Conclusion: I really do love this phone and I found the only flaw that it has is the camera but Motorola's older phones seem to have the same issue as well. The unit is a powerhouse and if you are looking for the belt of the best in cellular processing at the moment.

3470,B00HPP3QD6,thekeysstore,4,5-Feb-15,True,Best bank for the Buck,"I bought this to use only as a WiFi device and GPS, not a phone. Pros: I installed a free Navigator app which was of inestimable value when traveling recently in Switzerland. I've never used a Garmin so I cannot compare but considered buying one before I found the Moto G. The only issue was losing signal when in tunnels. The voice is female with a British accent. I didn't know what she meant at first by: ""take next slip road"" (read ""take next exit""). I also use this as my primary entertainment device for games, listening to music and audio books, and testing web apps that I develop. Google contacts were easy to sync. For the money it cannot be beat. I use an inexpensive flip phone for calls so I don't need or want to pay for cellular connectivity. No problem, it worked out of the box without nagging to activate cellular service. The battery usage is good if you turn off WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth when they are not needed. Screen is bright, good colors and contrast. It starts fast and runs briskly. The glass is strong and is scratch resistant. Cons: Too little memory and no external MicroSD slot to expand. I thought 8 gigs would be plenty for my usage but the OS takes a big chuck of it right off the bat. It's been knocked down a star because of this and because I haven't yet received an update to Android 5.0, although it did upgrade once to 4.4.4. I have 3 gigs free so that should be enough for the update which was rolled out in Nov/Dec of 2014 in the US and recently in other countries.

26203,B07WSJYDXX,Charlie Griffin,5,5-Aug-19,True,Great budget phone.,"I reviewed this when I bought the international version to save a few dollars. It turned out for me I was not able to get updates to Pie or security patches later than Jan 2019. I worked with Motorola and AT&T and no luck. Motorola advised that the international version might not work as well in the US as the country it was intended for. I returned the phone and replaced it with this US version. Updating problems solved. Motorola stated the US version would come with Pie already on it, but that was not the case. It's not a problem but the phone installed a half dozen security patches and then pulled down the Pie upgrade. What I wanted to let others know is even though there is a US warranty that warranty likely began when Amazon bought the phone not when you did. I registered mine with Motorola and my warranty runs out in Dec 2019. I just bought it two days. It seems very likely Amazon bought the phone Dec 2018. I am in the middle of getting my one year warranty corrected and Motorola support was nice about it. They just needed a receipt of purchase. I supplied what I could from Amazon and am waiting to see if that works for them. You may want to review your warranty status.

22775,B07NP6R2RG,terry,3,5-Aug-19,True,Delay on texting and calling,"I was very excited about getting this phone - the reviews were really positive and this international unit seemed like a great value for the money. Unfortunately, as several other reviewers have pointed out, there are issues using this with T-Mobile. It's not fatal but it IS annoying. I've had three problems: first, text messaging was blocked when I first got the phone. The T-Mobile tech guys were super helpful and got this resolved in about 24 hours. But over the last few weeks I've also experienced delays, sometimes dramatic, in sending text messages and getting calls to go through. I spoke to another T-Mobile tech guy to resolve this and after resetting and other things at his end, this was much improved with near immediate texting (as you'd expect) and normal calling. But now it seems to be slowing down again. The T-Mobile tech guy told me that their phones are optimized to work on the T-Mobile network and while this phone is ""unlocked,"" it doesn't interact with the service as seamlessly. I always thought T-Mobile phones were about marketing and branding. It didn't occur to me that buying one of their phones would generate better functionality. But I believe it. My husband bought a very inexpensive LG phone from the T-Mobile store (about $175) and he routinely gets better reception and generally better speeds even though his is theoretically a much lesser phone. Also as some folks noted, the battery life isn't great. This surprised me since the reviews indicated it was very good (though not as good as the Power). It barely lasts 12 hours with very normal usage. If you use the GPS or stream anything for any length of time, the battery will die even sooner. I try to remember to bring my charger if I'm going to be away all day. So, all in all, it's a nice phone, good camera, excellent price, etc. but to be honest, if I hadn't gone past the return window I'd probably return it and go buy a phone from the T-Mobile store to optimize the service. The good news is T-Mobile tech support is great and they've been super helpful in trying to work out these issues. But I suspect there's only so much they can do. Like I said, none of this is fatal but it's maddening watching the ""send"" notice spin round and round waiting for a text message to go.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G7 (64GB, 4GB RAM) Dual SIM 6.2"" 4G LTE (GSM Only) Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1962-4 No Warranty (Clear White)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Smartphone-International-XT1962-4/dp/B07NP6R2RG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c3FZ-X6nL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NP6R2RG,108,153.99,179.99

3830,B00JS73V2U,MattkPSU,4,5-Aug-15,False,got a refurb from VW and has been surprisingly good,"I was given this phone as a warranty replacement for an older Droid Razr Maxx HD, which itself was a warranty replacement for another Razr Maxx HD. The Droid Maxx finally stopped the vicious cycle of warranty replacements. It has been a godsend to finally get a phone that's reliable. The battery is a good size and the phone gets about 1.5 days with heavy usage. It's been durable too. I don't use a case or screen cover and it's been fine. The apps seem less buggy than they were on older razrs too. The extra RAM made a huge huge difference. I think Motorola finally has gotten things figured out. The biggest drawback of the phone is the limited storage capacity, combined with the lack of SD card slot. It's been a fine phone, except when I'm travelling and in an area with no verizon. Then the phone refuses to get text messages or allow data, and gives constant error messages about background data restrictions and other nonsense. My wife's GS5 had no issue in the same areas. One or two older Motorola chargers do not work well with this phone for some reason. Also, do not install McAfee antivirus on this phone, it will kill battery life badly with active scanning on. It will stop wifi from working, among other annoyances. You have been warned. All in all, this phone has been good for me and it hasn't been worth it to upgrade to newer phones. If you're looking for a bargain used phone on verizon's network, and don't need a huge amount of storage, then this phone is a solid choice. Pros: -much more reliable than past razrs (thank God!) - slim form, big screen, and nice overall design - low price on the used/refurb market Cons: - pathetic storage capacity (only 11gb in reality) and elimination of SD card - utter disaster when away from Verizon's network - Motorola slow with updates - camera and camera software are disappointing and frustrating at times - will often show no bars or extended coverage while other phones have 4g.

The on screen buttons are not always present either, leaving you stuck on certain web pages until you force them to reappear by holding the power button as if you were turning the phone off. This problem is most noticeable on YouTube when vidios are at full screen. The cases for the phone are no gem either. The life proof case snaped off part of my thumb nail when I tried to open the charging port and came with no holster. The next case had a holster but blocked out the top drag down menu, battery meter, and clock. And the only selling point they manage for this cheap phone is the equally cheap tablet that bundles with it. It's just a big version of the phone with all the same problems except it can't size several websites properly and has an annoying side menu for YouTube that cannot be dismissed. In short: Don't waste your money, better phones are out there. Update: After the last update, Google changed operating systems (OS) from the Lollipop OS to Marshmallow OS. They are all named after candy. But if Lollipop was a downgrade you can't even begin to imagine how bad Marshmallow is. The Silent mode option is gone and has been replaced with a less easily accessible No Disturbances mode. The difference is Silent mode was on the volume menu which made sence. No Disturbances is in the options menu meaning you have to unlock the phone and rute around for it and set it up for all the different things you want silenced. When I'm in class, I just want my phone to be quiet. Why is that so hard? Now I have to set 3 volume bars to vibrate which my teacher says isn't good enough or set up No Disturbances in advance as it cannot be done on the fly like before. Other problems are that when I click a link on line, I don't go to the link. A tab is opened and I have to open my browser to click the tab to go to the link instead of just going to the link when I click it. Google has really over complicated a device that was already a downgrade of something that was once so simple. Google is just getting worse with time trying to fix what wasn't broken.",3.0,Motorola,"Motorola XT1585 Turbo 2, (32GB) 5.4'' (White, Verizon)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1585-Turbo-White-Verizon/dp/B0192XJ0P6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uo-nK+OAL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,2.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0192XJ0P6,289,0.0,0.0

9824,B01LEL8ABY,EDREZ,4,4-Sep-17,True,Good phone but it fells short,"Well, I have had this mobile for 5 months now and I have mixed feelings, in one side this works flawlessly it never lags, I can open multiple apps without issues, the call quality is good, the camera is also very good during the day some amazing pictures but during the night its pretty avrg. On the build quality It feels good and strong even when its so thin!! the screen looks amazing and the sound is good. On the wrong side, the part of the back is some type of metal but it has a some sort of glass finish, it looks great!! however it catches a lot of dust and fingerprints really annoying, so I decided to cover it with one of the official covers, and I was REALLY disappointed on how cheap it was , to be honest I was expected much more quality to go with this high quality mobile, I havent tried the leather one (VERY expensive compared to the others), just the nilon red and black ones and was very disappointed. Other thing that I noticed last week is that the glass on the part of the back camera is already broken, I dont know how it did happen (since I havent dropped it or hit my phone I'm always really careful with them) and whatever happen I can say its because of the bad design on the camera I was expecting it to get scratched(I dont have any scratch yet) because of the design but not broken. On the battery side it barely made it to the end of the day but it was expected with a 2600 battery.

Absolute unit,"While you may need to adjust your expectations before you purchase this phone, it serves a certain kind of demographic in a way that no other phone on the market can right now. Cons: The screen. It's 720p and somewhat washed out. The speakers. Or, rather, the speaker. You're stuck with mono audio. The camera. Leaves much to be desired, but it'll get the job done. No NFC. Bummer. Service. Can be hard to make and receive calls in rural areas. Can't get service in some remote areas. Pros: Performance. I'm honestly surprised how snappy this phone has remained during my time with it. The 4GB of RAM helps a lot in this department. Price. I picked mine up for $200. And, finally, the reason why you're buying this phone... the BATTERY. It. Is. Insane. No matter how much I stream, play, or record, it takes THREE DAYS before this trooper will give up the ghost. At 10%, it was back up to 100% within 2.5 hours on Turbocharge. I wish every phone on the market was built to last as long as this one can.

It's the just the right size for me, not too big, but not too small either. I've dropped it a few times and you can barely see any knicks. I also made a huge mistake by dropping it into Lake Superior during a summer gathering in August. I was just walking along the beach when I decided to step into the water for a quick second to check out a pretty stone. I didn't notice I dropped the phone into the water until about 20 minutes later when I realized I didn't have it. I walked back down the beach looking for it when a man asked me if I had lost my phone. Sure enough it was my phone and he said he found it washed up on the beach. On my way back to the hotel, I stopped and bought some resealable bags and a box of white rice. I put the phone in a bag and surrounded it with rice and waited for 3 days, thinking my fairly new phone was a goner.

9825,B01LEL8ABY,M.,2,4-Mar-19,True,"1440p Res, AMOLED Screen, Crappy Battery, Cool phone mods","I am immensely disappointed this phone couldn't last me a year before the phone's battery started showing symptoms of a dying battery. I remember when overcharging was a thing and i bulged my iphone 2's battery. Though i don't know for sure its probably not from overcharge but overheating that stressed the battery and ultimately caused it to have extremely poor readings on the status, battery life and reliability. I specifically chose this phone because it was in a price range i liked and the concept of having mods on it was very cool to me, that and the specifications of the phone itself compared to the other high end phones at the time. I'd planned to use this phone to play games like i used to on my Nexus 2 but i wanted better performance because it'd lag very often on the Nexus 2. The phone performed pretty well on phone games with heavy visual effects and emulators such as playstation 1, but it didn't do very well on Gamecube Dolphin emulation. My issues with the phone are its seemingly extreme overheating, the fact that mod's don't really work with cases and the poor battery capacity. It overheats very easily when i play games and cant really tolerate it too long, not very good if you play phone games where you farm for long periods. It was noticeably hotter then my Nexus in my opinion, i kind of suspect if you put a case on it makes it overheat more but i don't know too much about that. Mods are cool but they are pretty expensive, and they probably don't work with a case. But then again i haven't tried. Battery life really sucks, and it will suck for heavy users because the screen looks best at max brightness which consumes a crapton of power. As for my battery issue i tried to contact Motorola about a repair, but they give you textbook answers and solutions before they seem to agree to let you repair it. Things like power cycling (restarting), safe mode and what not. They do follow up with an email and reminder to schedule a repair after the phone call however to their credit.

Instead of Tracfone to another Tracfone, I should have used Buy a Network Access Code. Anyway, I finally contacted customer service and spoke with a very nice Rep. At first it was, oh no, you have to have a Tracfone, (after all I did try to use the wrong option).

24798,B07RB78W37,Chicago dad,4,4-Jul-19,True,The Best Moto Z Yet (with caveats),"Our family has been a fan of the Moto Z family of products since its inception. We have almost every Moto mod ever made (most of them in multiples since we have 3 family members each with their own phones). And, we usually upgrade every time a new Z comes out, so the Z4 was a much anticipated upgrade and we bought it the day it was released. I am not going to spend a lot of time in this review talking about the usefulness of Moto Mods (we find the Hasselbad camera, JBL speakers, projector and battery mods infinitely useful; we wish there were other new mods coming out but Moto seems to have lost focus on new developments in that area). I am also not going to compare this to an iPhone or Samsung.... if you are looking at the Z4 you are interested in the mods, and the Z family with mods is unique in the market. You might say that the iPhone has a better camera (debatable, as the Z4 camera is fantastic), but the iPhone and Samsung don’t have pop on / pop off batteries, a high quality optical lens camera attachment, etc. so any comparison boils down to whether you value the mods. IF you do, the only choice is a Moto Z. There are some positives, and a few big negatives comparing the Z4 to its predecessors. Positives: Loved Android 9 (“Pie”) which was installed out of the box, no upgrade needed. Battery life was a huge improvement. With my heavily used device (multiple GPS apps, bluetooth, lots of long calls) my Z3 Play without a battery back would last about 5-8 hours before I would need to slap a battery mod onto it; but the Z4 would go all day and I never need to add a battery mod as long as I can get it to a charger by sleep time. The 1080p screen is gorgeous and much easier to read in sunlight versus the Z3 Play. All around, the device is much faster, snappier and apps work better. Love that this has 128GB out of the box storage. The built in camera is excellent with 48 megapixels and a high quality sensor - night mode actually works. The camera software is also much improved with additional filter features for social media integration. Negatives: The screen while excellent is much more fragile than the Z3, Z2 or Z. My Z4 is already in the shop for a screen repair after a very short (2 foot) drop to a tile floor that killed the entire screen. All of my other Z phones survived much, much worse than that on multiple occasions. The moto mods do not fit flush to the phone due to a slightly curved beveled edge that the Z4 has; an aesthetic issue only but it really might bother some folks. The 360 camera is not very useful because poor software makes it limited (especially when it comes to editing which is a critical part of the 360 camera experience). The on-screen fingerprint sensor is extremely sensitive to movement, finger placement, angle and cleanliness of screen and finger. Many times it just doesn’t work or requires multiple unlock attempts. This is a problem with all on-screen fingerprint readers I think, and I would much prefer to go back to the separate reader.",53.0,Motorola,"Moto Z4 – Unlocked – 128 GB – Flash Gray (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, Metro - PAF60007US",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z4-Unlocked-Warranty-PAF60007US/dp/B07RB78W37,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81POiya5gbL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RB78W37,60,399.99,499.99

Decided to go with an upgrade phone so tried the Moto G6 after reading all the positive reviews. Mine must have been a lemon, or a clone, which I suspect after running it through AnTuTu Officer and finding an ""Unknown"" result. I purchased it through Amazon with a reputable dealer. The phone worked fine. Sound on calls was bit high pitched and tinny. The display was bight, but not terribly sharp. Where it really fell short was with the camera. Again, I have to say mine might have been defective, but the colors were not true and the focus not sharp and clear. Pictures were over saturated. The selfie lenses worked, however, the blur background feature did not work at all. The sound on notifications and ringtones was very low at first and almost inaudible at times.

It was running Marshmallow and every feature worked - including tethering (on Cricket). Soon after I updated the OS to Nougat and then there were two or three more security updates immediately after that. Once I applied all of these updates tethering no longer worked. The phone started checking with carrier as to whether my phone was authorized for tethering. This is unacceptable on an unlocked non-carrier branded device. Its my phone, my plan - I should be able to use it as I please without it going behind my back to check with carrier as to what features my plan included. In the 10 days I had it - it was probably the best phone I ever owned. Lighting fast (WAAAAAY faster than my S7 edge).

3454,B00HPP3QD6,Paul Ruez,1,4-Jul-14,False,Verizon Moto G Prepaid misrepresented or at least very unclear,"My review is split into two parts: 1. The lowest rating is awarded for how the Vz Moto G is represented via Vz packaging, literature, over the phone and in person. 2. The Vz Moto G as a phone. This is posted separately. Review Part 1: I just bought two of these to replace my two LG2 prepaid phones. Moto G is advertised as PRE-PAID with NO CONTRACT but in order to validate you must agree to $45/month. My wife and I just returned from trying to get our new Moto G’s validated at two different Verizon stores. No-can-do without agreeing to pay $45/ month for NO contract prepaid phones!? Before buying the Mot G’s I spoke on the phone with a Verizon rep and asked whether the features of my current plan would apply to the Moto G and was told they would. We spent about 30 minutes reviewing plan features and cost of my current prepaid plan and I made it very clear that I was reviewing all of this because I needed to make sure that I would have the same costs if I purchased the Moto G. I was assured that my existing pre-paid balances would be applied to the Moto G. Likewise when I visited the Vz store (pre-purchase visit) that the transfer between phones would be possible and no problem. So I did my pre-purchase homework and never in the literature, on the phone or face to face did the issue of $45/month and other plan changes come up as being a default part of this package. On the packaging it reads “Up to $35 activation fee” but it’s really $45. In the Vz Customer Agreement on page 1 we read about the “Optional Services” being above and beyond the pay-per-use charges. “Optional”… you can’t even validate without paying the initial $45 which turns on these Talk & Text services. Technically the Vz Moto G is a pre-paid w/no contract deal – BUT – if your monthly balance falls below $45/mo. your talk time gets billed at .25 minute and .20 for each text sent and received. AND any prepaid dollars you put on phone automatically gets applied to bring your balance up to the required $45/month “Unlimited Talk & Text Plan” agreement. So if you are going to use at least $45 of Talk & Text per month this may the phone for you. At the Verizon store I was told that I would lose my existing prepaid balance. The “Verizon Customer Agreement” that comes with the Moto G says NOTHING about this. And try calling Verizon to speak with a real person... after you click 0 two or three times you get hung up on! To get a real person call 800-922-0204 #0 and ask to be transferred to prepaid… then WAIT. After sharing the above I did receive an apology today from another Vz rep who explained the above “Talk & Text” details to me. It is obvious that the first Vz rep I spoke with on the phone missed the part about my needing to use the LG 2 features we spent 30+ minutes about over to the Moto G. The Vz rep today did say that there are two non smart phones which will work on the basic prepaid plan I tried to move over to the Moto G: Samsung BrightSide and LG Extravert.",9.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

26189,B07WSJYDXX,Steve,5,4-Jan-19,True,Quality & Speed Are Fine,"My wife didn't check the pockets before doing laundry and tossed my jeans with my Moto E4 into the front loader washing machine. By the time we figured out it was missing, the load was 35 minutes into the cycle and it had been tossed around pretty good in soapy water. A colleague at work said they had salvaged his son's phone after a similar mishap, so I got out all the desiccant I could find and put the phone and the battery into a small tupperware container. Unfortunately, or may fortunately, it didn't work. I almost bought the same exact phone even though now it was over $100 and I think I got the old one for $80 or something. Then I started to read the reviews about the G6 and was quickly convinced to try this model instead. It solves some of the shortcomings of the old phone. While the camera is not exactly on par with the $800+ phones, it's light years better than the 5MP on the old E4. And I have seen claims that the G6 can do wireless calling, although I haven't tested it yet. We need this when we go to the lake and there's no cell phone towers, but there is high speed internet. Only had it for a few days, but so far, no complaints. I leave it plugged in most of the day at work, so battery hasn't been below 50%, but I have a strong feeling, that with my limited usage, it would last for way more than a day, maybe two. What was amazing and scary all at the same time was that after I plugged it in and logged into my Google account, all of my apps came down and were put on the same screen and everything. I don't know who to thank for that, probably the Google Gods who are watching my every movement and capturing it to disk. It didn't bring over passwords and the like, so there was still a very modest amount of setup to do to get all my apps working again. The phone is a little longer than the E4, but not any wider. I guess that's the latest trend, I see others with long skinny phones. It is very slippery though and I'm going to take the advice of others and get a case, even though I usually don't. Motorola makes great hardware IMO and I am still learning how to use the ""actions"" to turn on the camera and flashlight and all of that, so the phone has plenty of features. It is very fast, the screen resolution is great, it's way, way better than the E4 and came in at a little over $200 with tax. I was shocked when I saw that most Samsungs and iPhones are approaching $1,000 if you want to buy them outright and I really don't care for Verizon's pay as you go monthly plans. The price is the same either way, but I guess if I own it I try to take care of it better (by not leaving it in my pants pocket by the washing machine?). Perhaps this is why Apple's phone sales are down? If the devices cost a grand, people will not be very excited about replacing them every 2 years! UPDATE: As far as quick charging, I finally ran the battery down to 8%, plugged it into the charger and it was at 100% in just under an hour and half.",10.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

Screen is excellent, performance is great, and battery life is MUCH better than you'd expect from the relatively low 2600mAh capacity battery. Moto Mods work very well - I've tried the JBL speaker and the Incipio battery mods. I had both this phone and a Pixel XL. I bought the Moto Z when it was on sale for $499. At that price, it is MUCH better value than the minimum $869 for the Pixel XL. Were the prices equal, the Pixel XL would have edged it out, however all said, I just *LIKE* the Moto Z more than the Pixel XL. The only dings I have against the Moto Z are as follows - 1) There's a stupid notification bug which Motorola/Lenovo know about but I haven't yet seen a fix. 2) They've rolled out the Android 7.X Nougat update to the Verizon Droid editions of this phone, but the unlocked GSM edition is taking its sweet time and frankly it's getting frustrating.",4.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

Better screen , more ram and the latest android OS . I waited 3 weeks before submitting my review just in case , well I can not find a single flaw . I read that some units experienced sound issues , not on my unit . My upgrade did not go flawlessly how ever, I am using this phone on consumer cellular and what I thought would be a easy upgrade was not . !st issue was that my old phone used a micro sim , this phone uses a nano sim , so I had to order a new sim which cost me nothing but the time it took to arrive in the mail. So be advised You will need a nano sim. The second issue was sending pictures with text messages , I could not do so because that phone was not configured . But a call to my provider and having them email Me the setting to enter in fixed that issue ( hardly the phones fault ) What I have noticed is more bars on the mobile side using this phone . The call quality has went up . My camera picture quality has vastly improved and for the price is very good . I have no real complaints here and no buyers remorse . I did consider getting the 3GB ram version but IMO the higher end model will be worth it especially when they release the newest android version latter on , better to have and not need , then to need and not have . Battery life is ok , I am not joined to the hip with my phone so I am not constantly using it but I can get 4 days of standby and lite use per charge .",2.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

Battery lasts me two days, camera is adequate, can't complain about the screen, and performance is about what I'd expect for the price. There does seem to be a slight lack of signal strength vs an iPhone but that's a phone that costs 5x as much so it's hard to fault the Motorola too much. The chop-for-flashlight and twist-for-camera gestures seemed gimmicky at first but now I feel dirty inside any time I use a phone that doesn't have them and find myself using them 2 to 3 times per day.

Then, my screen started flickering and then arbitrarily the phone would turn off by itself even with a full battery charge. I obviously got a bad phone, so I was not necessarily jaded on the Moto line of phones in general. As far as features, the only really drawback was the battery life. I decided to try the Moto G7 Power. While the G7 has a 3000 mAh battery, the G7 Power has a 5000 mAh battery! In my opinion, this one feature makes the G7 Power the only phone in the Motorola ""affordable"" line of cell phones to get. I returned the G7 to Amazon and so far I am extremely pleased with the G7 Power. Also, there is no reason to purchase the higher storage capcity Moto G7.

18350,B07C2VFMN2,Buck Wheat,5,4-Apr-19,True,100% Better Then The LG G-5 It Replaced,"My wife and I both had the LG G5, I replaced my LG first with a Moto X Pure and couldn't have been happier, I then purchased this Z3 Play for my wife for her Birthday and its 100% better then the LG Junk she had before, that constantly dropped calls because of the poor antenna design of the LG. Anyways she loves the Finger print feature that lets her unlock the phone with just the swipe of her thumb, Also the camera takes nice pictures, plus the free Moto Mod Power pack that's now included keeps the phone charged up for two days if she doesn't use it a lot. We have both of our phones on ""Total Wireless"" and set up was a breeze using Totals web site, All I needed to do was sign into my account, Then I clicked on the bring your own phone, and then I entered the new Phones Serial # and then the new SIMs card number which was simple because this phone uses the smaller Nano card that came as a pair with the bigger SIM card that I had to use in the old LG, There was no waiting for the new phone to activate, it was up and running as soon as I entered the new SIM's number. I would like to add one thing here, I have read reports that some people who purchased this phone are unhappy with the Battery life, even when it has the Moto Mod Power Pack installed, I then read on Motorola's Owner's Forums that you need to completely discharge the phone with power pack installed, then charge both up to 100%, after you do this 4 or 5 times (Condition The Batteries) the phone with power pack installed will hold a charge longer and increase your talk time, I know Lithium-Ion Batteries are not suppose to develop what we use to refer to as a memory, but for some reason the Power that comes with the Z3-Play does or will, which is why you need to condition it. I will check back here in a couple of weeks with and up date on how things are going, but so far she loves the Z3 Play. (UP DATE 06/06/19) I'm happy to report that my Wife's Z3 is still working great and she couldn't be happier, Like I mentioned above we both had the LG G5 before we switched to Motorola's and the difference in reception using the same carries is like Night & Day, The LG's with their small garbage internal Antennas we were lucky to get 2 bars here where we live, but with the Motorola's we are both getting full bars 4G lite, plus no dropped calls like before.",3.0,Motorola,Motorola Z3 Play & Moto Power Pack - Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) - 64GB - Deep Indigo (US Warranty) - PA9S0000US,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z3-Play-Power-Pack/dp/B07C2VFMN2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N-Axwzz1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07C2VFMN2,84,229.99,499.99

5309,B00OZTSY6Y,Edward Geiger,4,31-Oct-16,True,It was great while it lasted. Now it's a great mp3 player on steroids.,"First off, I just wanna say this best device since the Motorola Moto G which was one of my favorites during its time. I ordered a Ballistic Nylon, but I got a smooth-backed one? I'm not complaining, because it turned out that Ballistic Nylon ones are harder to fit into cases. - The power! This Droid Turbo is incredible. I don't know how Motorola managed to squeeze a 2.7Ghz quad-core processor into this thing, but it's fast. I can swap from Facebook to NOVA 3 (an amazing fps game) without having to restart either application. - The battery! Now, when I first got the device, I was a bit skeptical about the battery life. Upon first usage of the device, I got about 3 hours out of the battery, BUT after a few battery-life-cycles, I can go about 3 days on light usage (text, talk, music, etc..). If I wanna play some games, browse through the Web, and check social media's, I will get about a day and half out of the battery. That's actually amazing for such a high clocked CPU. This phone does feature a wireless charging capability which works flawlessly. -The Display: Super AMOLED... SPECTACULAR. Enough said. -The camera: This wasn't very impressive, but still great. While the camera is stunning, it dies take a moment to focus... About 3 seconds, actually. There's also about 1 second delay upon snapping a picture and the phone actually snapping the picture. At least it's crazy quality, but this is horrible when trying to take pictures of 2 hyper cats. The video is amazing, capturing 4K HD like a boss. The front camera is great. It is actually very clear for a front camera. - overall, this is a beast of a device. I wouldn't trade it for the latest iPhone or Windows phone, because when it comes to Android, Droid does. I only wish there was a bigger selection of cases. Specifically, an aluminum alloy case with built-in tempered glass like the one I had for my Galaxy S4. Buy, Ghostek did nicely of this case I'm using now. Update: After about 4 months, the handset microphone stopped working. This means, no one I called from the device could hear me, though I could hear them clearly. Upon activating speakerphone, they could hear me slightly, but not clearly.

22505,B07N91S9MW,Dustin,4,31-May-19,True,"A feature phone without the feature phone price, with ONE caveat: no NFC.","My old phone, the Moto X Pure Edition (or Style), began to have ghost touches about 4 weeks ago. It gradually became severe, to the point the phone was unusable. However, I was impressed with the build quality of the phone and because I am rather hard on my devices, attributed the problem to abuse on my end, probably some micro damage to the screen or hardware itself from being dropped. As I began looking at devices that offered high value for the money, the Moto G7 came up repeatedly. The Memorial Day Sale here on Amazon was in place and I was fed up with the ghost touches, so I gave in and bought a Moto G7. When I first took it for a spin, I was impressed. The fingerprint reader is awesome and incredibly convenient. I took the picture for facial recognition in what I thought was less than favorable lighting, yet it works very well also, unlocking my phone before I even enter one number of my pin. The screen is large and easy on the eyes, with rich color and sharp detail. The camera? Also a thing of beauty. It may not be a $999 dollar feature phone, however this phone comes the closest of any I've owned to truly capturing what I see. It's fast, fast, fast, and feels like it's worth a lot more than what I paid. This is a feature phone, and is priced very attractively. I am glad I didn't spill hundreds of dollars more and settled on the Moto G7, and will be upgrading my wife to one against her will in the future (She also has a Moto X Pure that she is very happy with). The ONLY problem I have is, it does not have NFC. This is a big problem to me. The wireless payment option that this allows is incredibly convenient.

It will run less than 3 hours on a full charge if doing anything other than sitting still on a desk. Phone calls, internet use, forget about taking video or pictures - all these uses burn up the battery very very quickly. It has also developed a really annoying habit of shutting down when the battery says it still has 30-40% charge left. I can't even count up how many times the poor battery life has ruined events where I am trying to record video. Also, the hasselblad mod no longer seems to want to work. It constantly shuts down the camera app stating there has been an error. I can only assume this is a fault within the phone as the mod has been babied and used very infrequently.

5297,B00OZTSY6Y,Sarah K. Nearhood,1,31-May-16,False,BUYER BEWARE - MAJOR DEFECT - MOTOROLA INSISTS IT ISN'T,"I will make it very simple - DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! It has known issues. Known by Motorola, known by Verizon. Neither is interested in standing behind it and making it right for the MANY of us who are being affected by this defect. SO what is the defect? Well i have a bright green vertical pixel lines that goes from top to bottom of my entire screen. Google ""Motorola Turbo2 green line"" and see for yourself, or go to their own forums to look at all the threads about people like me having an issue. Mine started off as a line 1 pixel wide, its steadily creeping wider and wider. Now i cant read entire words on it. I had the phone less than 3 months before it appeared. Have taken good care of it. No bad falls or drops. After reading the forums and how many were already on their 3rd or 4th return, and all developing the line, I had held off hoping Motorola would admit there was an issue or find a fix for it. Nope! they insist the green line is being caused by ppl dropping their phones and abusing them. The Turbo 2 is ""shatterproof, not shockproof"" to quote what they are saying about the issue. This is my third Motorola Droid style phone. I had a Droid before they had snazzy names, a Droid Razr, Droid Max and now the Droid Turbo2. The 1st 3 phones were rugged, loved them. I swore by Motorola.... up until now. But truth is, their new ""shatterproof phone"" is JUNK. I noticed early on, if i tucked the phone into a jeans pocket and didnt remove it before getting into the car , the slight bit of pressure on the phone getting in and out makes the phone entirely reboot. Before this, other than shift the phone around into a more comfortable spot in my pocket, i would be fine getting in and out a car, riding around with the other 3. This one is extremely sensitive to any pressure whatsoever. There are pressure points in different places around the screen i can press with a finger and it affects the phone. And I am not talking extreme pressure by an means. So now, that its getting difficult to read my emails I am finally returning it. No easy task. They wouldn't even allow me to go through the repair process until I send in a picture of the green lines to prove i was really having the issue. Which i would not have had a problem with if it meant it fell under a defect category and helped me get through their process any quicker. But no, it doesn't. Instead I was told i had to either go without a phone for over a week while i shipped it to them, it with thru procedures etc and then they made a decision what to do (repair or replace), or i could pay a convenience fee to get a replacement and THEN ship my phone to them. Not being able to go without my phone for an entire week (or more) I bit the bullet and paid their convenience fee today. This evening when i viewed my credit card, i got another surprise. Its not just the convenience fee i am being charged, its an estimated repair charge too. Despite the fact the phone is under warranty. How can they do this? Easy, they have they picture they insisted i send them showing a green line. The green line is damage, not a defect. Now i know why they insisted on getting the picture before they would proceed. This will be my last Motorola purchase. And likely an end to me being with Verizon once my contract is over in 2 years. From looking at the forums, Verizon is very aware of this issue also.

5283,B00OZTSY6Y,Rudy,5,31-Mar-15,False,a step in the right direction!,"cell phones, over the last decade or so, have become a necessity, something you have to have all day everyday. My old iphone 4 8gb, was on it's last legs. freezing up and battery wouldn't last more than 3 hours without a charge. i had been eyeing the motorola droid turbo since it came out, and decided to go ahead and upgrade. phone comes in a very nice, sleek box, naturally, there is VERY LITTLE information that comes with the phone. that's why you have to come online to youtube and other sites to figure out how to operate the phone. phone comes with a turbo charger and a very SHORT cord. so plan, on buying a new cord or a extension. the phone can charge to full charge in less than an hour. the phone has a massive 3,900 MH battery. that translates to a lot of use. i have had upwards of 30 hours on a charge and still had 45 percent left! however, your battery life is going to depend on a lot of things, screen brightness, apps and other things running. i have had this phone for about a month, and my battery life has stayed pretty steady. i keep the screen brightness down, and keep the gps on battery saving mode and my results have been great. phone display is a beautiful AMOLED display. i paired mine with a Otterbox Otterbox 77-50191 Droid(tm) Turbo By Motorola(r) Commuter Series(r) Case (scarlet Flash) - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Scarlet Flash and am very happy. I never have a phone without a case. the droid operating system is easy to use, but if your coming from a iphone, there is a learning curve. just be mindful of that if your a former iphone user. im very happy with this phone, if your tired of the slowness of the iphone etc, get a droid turbo today! update 1/17/16** phone performed flawlessly UNTIL the android lollipop update. now battery life is NO WHERE near as good as it was. i love android, but i really do wish phone manufacturers would test the updates more with various phones/models before they push the update to everyone. now i can't even make it through a full day on a charge :( ugh!",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

14669,B072ZWCKP5,Carl,5,31-Jul-18,True,"Great phone, fast, Unlocked, Multimode, robust battery, fingerprint reader","Hey we like these phones a lot. Wife and I had OnePlus One phones for the past 3 years - really great phones and still are. But, unfortunately they are unlocked GSM phones - not unlocked Multimode phones. Had AT&T not changed their signal power such that we could not get voice service inside out house, we would still be using our OnePlus Ones. Verizon is the premier service where I live but our OnePlus Ones don't work with Verizon - Verizon is CDMA based, our phones GSM. So we decided if we have to purchase new phones in order to get Verizon service, we want them to work on any carrier and our main criteria was Unlocked, and Multimode. These Moto E Plus are Multimode and will work with Verizon, AT&T, T-mobile, and Sprint. In addition we don't have to fool with going to a phone store to get signed up - our Unlocked phones allow us to use more flexible companies for service. We are using Red Pocket MVNO for a better Verizon plan that suits our needs. Meeting our needs above, this phone also has a very robust Battery, Fingerprint reader that is nice to have, and the pre-installed Apps are nice and not overly done like I hear about other phones. In addition, you can easily open the back cover - it does not take special skills to break the seal like other phones. This could be important just in case the battery ever gives trouble as there is a video on YouTube showing how to replace the battery with reasonable skill level. Oh yes, removing the back cover allows you to install the SIM card for your carrier, and also install an SDCard. Just installed a 64GB Class 10 Samsung SDCard from Amazon and now have even more storage.",3.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

Obviously it doesn't perform as well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does.

3464,B00HPP3QD6,Hope,4,31-Jul-14,True,Amazing phone except for camera quality,"I bought this about a month ago myself for my first phone and it's great! I'll break down the basic aspects of this phone. Prepaid: It's prepaid which is what I wanted so I wouldn't have to agree to contracts. With using up the money (on data) to make it last longer all I have to do is turn the data off when I finish replying to a message or not checking anything then when I know I should be getting a reply or some kind of other notification I turn the data back on and repeat the process. By doing it this way I spend only about $.01 each time I turn it on then back off again (I have all background data off for my apps which I highly recommend you do). Here is a tip: if you use only prepaid cards texts using the system's default costs $.20 per text sent and received (not worth it); install a free texting app (I use TextNow) and use data on that to get around the $.20 per text sent and received and pay about $.01 ""per text"" when you turn data on and off. Also as a note about redeeming the Verizon Prepaid cards: cards priced $15 (the cheapest card available) to $29.99 expire after 30 days of being applied to your account, cards $30-$74.99 expire after 90 days of being applied to the account, $75-$99.99 expire after 180 days of being applied, and $100 or more expires after one year of being applied to the account. This means any money you have left on your account will just disappear (I suggest you keep track of when you redeem them). But as a note I redeemed a $15 card then before it expired I added another $20 (both good for only 30 days) and it extended the time for the new total balance including my old balance to when the $20 card expires! With Verizon reception it's so-so. At home (in the suburbs) I get usually about 2-3 bars and 3G takes longer than it should. At my little vacation place that's surrounded by farm land and pretty much in the middle of nowhere I usually get about 2-3 bars and when I'm driving around sometimes I get up to 4 or 5 and even with 2-3 bars it connects to 3G much faster than at home (also as a note I have roaming turned off). Camera: I wouldn't even bother mentioning this normally but this is the reason I gave this phone only 4 stars. The quality is beyond words terrible. You have to be in bright natural light to take a front facing picture or the picture will appear blue tinted. If it's not natural light you will appear orange no matter how far you are away from the light (or if you're far enough it'll be a dark shadow). For rear camera photos they're okay in artificial light but they appear so sharply focused and makes pictures look very unattractive (to me anyway). The flash is also very long and blinding but helps the quality a little. Display/Software: The display is amazing on this phone! I didn't think it'd be so great looking that I could compare it with my iPod touch since I only paid $70 for this phone but I believe this display is even better (ignoring the poor camera quality). This phone's brightness is brighter than I'm used to and doesn't really get dark enough for me but it's not bad at all. Listening to music on this phone using the speaker on the back is amazing! It's clear and loud even on a low setting. One thing though, I have heard people complain about the calling quality on this phone and say it's really bad and they have to constantly repeat themselves. Not sure if it really is that bad since I haven't tried calling on it yet but I'll update this review with that information when I do. Now for the software: this phone uses KitKat and as I'm typing up this review the latest update I've gotten (about 1 week ago) was version 4.4.4 (which is the latest). The software is great to use and I like it better than Apple's (I just tried out Android with this phone and I see how it's better). Games are good on this phone since the screen is on the bigger side. This version of the Moto G when you first purchase it (before you download anything) has about 5.5 GB of storage. It doesn't sound like a lot but it's working out alright for me. Love the display and software on this phone! Look & Feel: This phone looks kind of like an iPhone to me (on the front) but longer and thicker. It's kind of clunky since it's so thick but I've gotten used to it. Even though it's a longer and wider phone it fits in the compartments on my backpack and in my back pockets alright. I've come to like the structure of this phone physically. I didn't expect the review to be this long so I'll just summarize it just in case you didn't want to read all of that. Prepaid on this phone is great and there are ways around the expensive charges for texting and calling when you do not have a contract plan and reception with Verizon is so-so, just depends. The camera quality is terrible and is why I gave this phone only 4 stars. The display on this is better than on my iPod touch (which costs more than double of this phone). The latest software on here (KitKat 4.4.4) is great to use and the storage on here is about 5.5 GB of your personal downloads which doesn't sound like a lot but works alright for me. It's a bit of a big, clunky phone but I've come to like how it's built and the structure isn't really a problem. I would recommend this phone to anyone it's just amazing.",10.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

It keeps freezing up and then rebooting. Apparently, this is a known problem. It's not clear what the fix is. I've found about 6 different ""fixes"" on the internet, but none of them explain why it's happening. I keep checking for system updates, and installing them, hoping one will solve this issue. I'm also trying to contact Motorola about this issue. I'm also having difficulty detecting bluetooth devices for pairing. I'll follow up with this review as i learn more. 2/10. Things are better, but not without issues. I've run system updates until current. The spontaneous shutting down seems to have stopped. Bluetooth seems to be working now, although it doesn't seem to want to pair with my devices all the time. Today however another issue came up - the battery dropped from 50% to nothing (dead) in a few hours, while the phone was not in use. I'm not sure what happened. Also, a fully charged phone drops to 80% overnight. That doesn't seem right either. Again this seems to be a known issue with the phone. Could be that it's not calibrated correctly. will try to update with more info when I can.",3.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99
20864,B07HFKWDK7,D. Hill,1,31-Jan-19,True,Too many problems,"I upgraded from a Moto G3 to this Moto G5s plus. On the G3, the back camera is recessed to avoid scratches and such. On the G5splus the camera is raised, don’t know what the designers were thinking. I call that a design flaw. Another problem is the shutter speed when taking pictures of moving objects. I have tried about 30 times and have been unable to take a non-blurry picture of a slowly moving object. I turned off the HDR and Google Lens but it made no difference. I never had this problem with the G3. As others have noted there is some problem with the cell network with this phone and being in the USA; and in my case, Cricket. I've read lots of forums and posts and tried lots of different settings etc. etc. but 95% of the time my phone uses cell network H rather than LTE. I went to one site that suggested that this international model will never do LTE inside US and using Cricket. Would love Motorola to put out a patch to overcome this problem. (in addition to a patch to fix the camera) Anyway, it’s a nice phone, bigger than I wanted. If anyone at Lenovo is reading this, here is your next phone to release and it will sell like hot cakes: Take this phone, replace the ""dual"" cameras on the back with a single camera with a faster shutter speed, recess the camera as in past models, and make the whole phone 20% smaller. Name it the Moto G5s Compact. Update 3/19/2019 - I am now actively looking for a new phone. I was ok with this phone not being LTE but daily it will lose all Internet access whether on wifi or not. During that time it looses all cell usage as well. If I reboot the phone, things start working again. I reboot this phone at least once a day.

1288,B0096QYH80,Verified purchaser,4,31-Jan-13,False,"Good phone, some quirks","It's easy to get bogged down in the critical, so let me start off by saying that this is, overall, a wonderful phone. Jelly Bean is a wonderful OS. The fact that Moto doesn't add much to it is a testament to Google's influence. And that is a good thing, in my book. The major plusses - call quality, talk and data signal strength, the speed with which you can move through screens and apps - it really is a good device. I am coming to this device from an HTC Thunderbolt and a Razr Maxx HD (that fell victim to a horrible accident). When they say that this phone is the most compact Android device with a 4.3-inch screen, that's not just PR hype. This is a very thin, light (though well-constructed), phone. Coming from the above devices, I found myself thinking the phone was TOO thin and TOO light. I have big hands and I kept feeling like the phone was going to shoot out of my hands, but after putting a case on it, I no longer have any problems. I only have three negatives (other than the above about the size and heft of the device - and I think that's personal preference). The first is the LED. I am used to it glowing when it's plugged in, and according to the manual, it's supposed to do so. Mine doesn't. In fact, the only time the LED flashes is when I get a text or email, and it wasn't even doing that at first. Aftermarket LED apps didn't do any good, either. I assume it's just my device being wonky, but I have read where others have had different issues. Second, and I think is an issue across the board with Jelly Bean, is the difficulty in making an MP3 your ringtone or notification sound. Used to be able to do this simply through your default media player. Now you have to download an app to make this happen (and there are apps that make this a very simple process). It just shouldn't be that hard. I think this should be a built-in function. Last - I'm having a hell of a time keeping the phone connected to my computer when I attempt to transfer media to the phone. Whenever I drag and drop files over, it's hit or miss as to whether they'll actually copy. Often I get an error saying something along the lines of ""the device has stopped working."" This happens whether or not I'm attempting to transfer to the SD card or internal memory, whether or not I'm connected as an Media Device or ""camera,"" regarless of what iteration of USB port I'm connected to (1.0, 2.0 or 3.0), and on various versions of Windown (Vista, 7 and 8). I'm sure there's a simple something I'm not doing or some bug that needs to be found. I just haven't yet found it. Overall, though, this is a great phone, and the fact that I was able to get it for a penny on contract was too good a deal to pass up.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

Now, I never did purchase an iPhone, because I refuse to spend that kind of money when I feel that Android phones are perfectly adequate, but my daughters and friends have them. They are nice. But, I do like the Motorola DROID RAZR M 4G better than anything I have experienced. That includes the Samsung Galazy SIII and Note2. The processor is adequate, because I don't use my phone for business. The SMALLER size is perfect and the HD screen is good for videos, especially Netflix. My daughter is jealous at the airport as we wait & I finish my film or documentary while she is flat bored. The screen on her Blackberry is inadequate, but she refuses to venture outside of the RIM device world. I love the Android Jellybean, too. Then, the other day, my Google Search application updated. Now, all I have to do is ask for the weather and there it is! I know, iPhone people may yawn, but I usually don't think of using...perks. But best of all, the battery life is AMAZING! This is my first Android phone that doesn't need to be recharged twice a day. Sometimes, I will charge it every other day. I love it.

26394,B07WSJYDXX,dune58,4,31-Dec-18,True,This phone is almost perfect,"I upgraded to the G6 play from the G4, which was a truly awesome phone in most every way. The G6 play has one particular problem that I am trying to hash out now. The fingerprint reader (located on the back) just does not like my fingerprint! It doesn't read it the first time, often doesn't read it after 3 tries, and then I have to swipe up and trace my security pattern. Happens most of the time. I am trying to sort out the problem with Motorola and if they can help me fix it, I will come back here and update my review. One other issue is that with T-Mobile as my carrier, if I set Wifi calling to wifi preferred, I can't seem to send text messages. I think that's a t-mobile issue and will try to get that sorted out as well. Other than that, the phone is awesome! Battery life is fantastic and for a budget phone, the sound and call quality are pretty much perfect. Edit: Motorola offered to replace the phone because of the fingerprint sensor problem. As well, Amazon was willing to take it back (it's only been a month). So I removed the SIM card to swap it back into my old Moto G4, but then realized that I had punched out the SIM to the ""micro"" size and could no longer use it in the G4. With the intention of getting a new SIM from my provider, I put it back into the G6, powered it up, and suddenly the fingerprint sensor is working flawlessly. I have no idea if there is any correlation, but I'll take it, at least for now. It's been about 18 hours - I'll give it a few days and see how it goes. Edit 2: The fingerprint sensor was back to its old tricks after 24 hours, so I am returning it to Amazon and buying the G6 (not G6 Play) - hoping that one does not have the same issue.

18805,B07CHWMYHP,FoxSquirrel,5,31-Aug-18,True,Great phone all around,"So, I've been using this phone for a few days now and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed with it. Honestly, I came from using an iPhone X to using this so to say that is quite the compliment. Restoring Backed-up SMS/MMS: So i restored 80,000 SMS/MMS from my iPhone X (Messages I've been accumulating since 2014 from different phones) to this phone in about an hour which is excellent considering. I used the app mobiletrans which seemed to work pretty well with this phone. Performance: Works incredibly well, no noticeable lag really and I have a tonne of apps installed. I do often end apps using the app manager though because I don't like to have too many apps running in the background, it's nothing to do with the phone, just a personal choice. I used to do the same thing on my iPhone. Camera: I initially wasn't really that impressed with the camera, BUT an update came in for the camera app that made it incredibly better. I mean the camera isn't as good as a flagship but it really is decent for the price. It works great in daylight, and decently in low-light situations. Design: I love the design of this phone, it honestly does seem like a premium device when you look at it. Only thing is I wish the screen stretched the whole length of the device such as on flagships, however despite this I do really like the design. I do have the plastic cover on it that came in the original box though to protect the back of the phone from scratches. Gestures: This is my first Motorola phone, but I figured I would get it because the phone had excellent reviews for being a budget phone. I really like Motorola's chop and twist gestures to turn the flashlight on or access the camera, makes it super convenient. I also turned on the One-button nav so I could get rid of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen so I could have more screen real estate. Coming from an iPhone the bottom nav bar seemed kind of 'outdated' and I find the one-button nav fairly easy to use. OS: It is almost stock android which is good, none loaded with all this extra junk that I would never use. Samsung is notorious from putting junk on their phones, so Motorola seems to excel at keeping it a clean experience. This phone comes with 8.0 Oreo, which is a good OS. Oreo seems to be a good stable OS, haven't experienced any app crashing so far and its loaded with a lot of useful features. Works in North America: This phone works fine with my Canadian provider. Doesn't have any trouble connecting to my Band 4 LTE, so I'm guessing the frequencies written for the version XT-1926-7 are correct and that they do have the North American LTE bands active. You have to be careful though purchasing it, I know some providers such as AT&T (USA) will disable the LTE connection on 'International Phones' even though the phone would technically work fine on their network. Bottom Line: I'd definitely recommend this product, however Motorola is a manufactures known for having slow updates so they do really need to work on that.

When I travel into the countryside or forests of the Western United States the availability of T-Mobile's network drops off quickly. Verizon seems much more reliable in distant locations so I wanted a verizon phone that I could use when traveling and vacationing. For $45/mo I can activate service month to month. The Moto G on prepaid no commitment subsidy is a great deal. Lacks the screen size and storage of my nexus 5 but works almost as well. With the moto g as soon as you turn it on it wants to call verizon hq and activate. You can do this without giving verizon a credit card and use it as a wifi device. You could also go buy a prepaid service card at a store. Pay cash and leave no trace back to you. Great for international spies, or folks who don't use credit cards. Activation gives the phone a phone number. I assume it also starts the clock on the verizon unlocking policy. After 6 months the phone can be used on any verizon plan. And after 12 months you can request an unlock code and use it on any carrier that has a CDMA network. ie sprint or virtual carriers like boost, page plus, tracfone, net10 or straight talk. The unlocking policy currently says nothing about the phone being used for calls, just ''activated'' for 6 and 12 months. For me I probably will just use verizon prepaid service since the cost is competitive currently and it is access to the verizon network I'm after. I've not tested it, but supposedly the phone can be used to make 911 calls without a current plan in place so it could be a handy item for emergencies. Again with the good rural coverage. The battery does not pop out for quick swaps but it is a simple matter to replace it with a screwdriver. As many have said, the moto g is about as sturdy as a smart phone can be. People have even soaked them in water for half an hour with no serious damage! Try that with your $800 flagship phone. For people who want to explore the moto g to greater degrees I've read that there is an online service that will unlock the bootloader for $25. If you don't know what that is, never mind. According to the page plus community the same phone for Boost mobile (sprint) has less locking of its bootloader. Not an expert so I'll stop there. So many great reasons to own the moto g. Enjoy.

8464,B01DZJFWWS,Pants,2,30-Oct-17,True,Sharp decline in quality,"I loved my old Moto G. If the power button hadn't failed after a few years, I'd probably still be using it now. It wasn't exciting, but it was sturdy, dependable, and nearly indestructible. I had high hopes for this generation, but it was not to be. If the Moto G was a gruff, no-nonsense warrior king, the Moto G4 is what you get from royalty after several generations of unchecked inbreeding. Physically, the phone feels fairly well constructed, if noticeably lighter. The light plastic back has a habit of popping off occasionally, but it's not too bad. I seriously hate that it's too big to easily hold in one hand, but I guess that's what phones are doing these days. The integrated ads weren't annoying at all. The camera is better than I'm used to. My real problem is with the tendency to ""jitter"" whenever it gets a little warm. It happens when the phone has been in my pocket, or near anything like direct sunlight, or charging, or thinking too hard. The screen bounces, apps open and close, icons slide around...on a few occasions it made Facebook updates. That was weird. It got very frustrating when it happened while I was in the car trying to navigate, or when I was locked out of my house fighting to open the app that controls my Bluetooth-enabled lock, or doing really anything while it was plugged in to charge. And after a year, the battery life has dropped noticeably, so it spends a lot of time charging. And thus we come to the end of my complaints: the micro USB port is pretty much shot. I'm writing this on my phone right now, on what is probably its final charge. Goodnight, sweet prince. You were a disappointing successor.

Like; Sound is awesome, both earpiece and speaker. Speakers are as good as an HTC One M8. No kidding. Radios are top notch. Gets excellent signal, and good signal where others get none at all Controls are very easy to use and plain to the touch. SoC is fast. Really fast. The phone is responsive and stutter-free. So-so Display is good. Not super great, but good. Brightness is fine, but cannot dim down far enough. Sharp enough, but compared to something like a G3, the difference is notable. Everyone says you can't see the difference in sharpness on the new QHD displays. Baloney. Yeah you can. Body is solid and feels OK in the hand, but benefits from a thin case. Not as comfortable as the 2013 model. Battery is OK. Not great but not awful. Idle time is forever, but when you start making the phone work it drops faster than it ought. Bad; Too big. I know, Motorola did market research and blah blah blah. It's too damn big. The new dialer sucks. I mean it's awful. Replacing that. Insufficient memory. Don't buy a 16Gig phone. Go to Moto Maker and spring for 32gig. It might be OK if Verizon didn't just HAVE to crap all over it with their useless stuff you can't remove, but they did and you're screwed there. So far I'm reasonably happy with the phone. I suspect the Turbo is in my future though. More battery and more storage, and a QHD display. EDIT - Increased my rating by a star. I returned the phone and went to Moto Maker for a 32Gig version. Also added a leather back just because. I went back temporarily to the 2013 version and, well, I like the bigger version now. While the smaller one is better to carry, the bigger one is better to use. Also the 2014 SOUNDS a lot better than the 2013 version. A *LOT* better. So I retired the 2013 version completely and believe it or not went back to a Razr MaxxHD (the old standby - awesome phone!) until the new one is delivered. I could wish battery was better, but overall the new X is pretty good aside from the crapware. Performance is good and screen is also.

1360,B0096QYH80,Jarodee,4,30-Oct-12,False,A Great Device!,"This is my first personal smartphone, but I've used all of my friends' phones (iPhone's, Android's, Windows Mobile's) and none of theirs can even come close to the speed or compactness of this phone. The 1.5 GHz dual core packs a serious punch in every application I've run (including open-world ""The Amazing Spiderman"" and the beautiful, intensive ""Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation""; the latter could barely function on my friend's fourth generation iPod Touch, while my phone is able to run it at least 60 FPS and add some beauty [such as increased smoke, improved anti-aliasing, etc.]) and the gig of RAM lets me switch between the chaotic 12-man battles of Fallen Nation and text messaging my buddies without a single hiccup. Because of the limited storage on the phone (I was able to use something like 4 gigabytes for my own content)I also purchased a SanDisk MicroSD 10X Ultimate 64 gigabyte memory card, which has worked flawlessly with the phone (note: small apps and apps that are installers for large apps (e.g. Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation) will download the installer to the phone memory, and then all app content will be saved to the SD card, keeping only a couple of megabytes on the phone). 1. No storage switching Unlike most Android phones, downloaded apps cannot be downloaded straight to the memory card. This excluded feature makes downloading large apps like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" nearly impossible as 1.35GB must be available on the internal memory (I have about 1 free) 2. Only ""okay"" battery life The battery will get you through the day no problem if mobile data is disabled, but if it is enabled then you won't go very far. I have spent a four-hour roadtrip listening to a combination of Spotify, SoundCloud, and Google Play and lost half the battery life. During this trip, the screen was kept off most of the time, and the Spotify playlist was pre-downloaded and SoundCloud keeps a media cache on the SD card; no battery was used due to intensive streaming, just the mobile data. The screen alone is pretty draining, but nothing that can't be drastically improved by disabling automatic brightness and turning the brightness down to the lowest setting. Overall, if you're looking for a powerful, lightweight phone with a large screen (however, one that can get your thumb from one corner to the other) and don't have to worry about the availability of charging time, then definitely pick one of these up!",5.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

5287,B00OZTSY6Y,Frank H.,5,30-Nov-14,False,"Excellent choice for performance, battery life, and overall quality and support","Pros: Excellent Battery Life - This is the first phone I've owned that easily lasts a day. Charges quickly using the included Turbo charger, charges normally on standard microUSB chargers. Fast and Responsive - No lag, apps install in a split second. Voice Activation - The phone has a dedicated speech recognition chip which works quite well for voice commands. It automatically detects when driving in vehicle and offers to read text messages out loud, a very convenient feature. Excellent Display - The extreme high resolution of this display is overkill, if anything. Solid Build Quality - Very solid frame with no flex. My past experience with Motorola devices is that they've been very well built and durable, no reason to believe this one will be an exception. Good Product Support - Motorola offers one free, no-deductable screen replacement and has a reputation for good support. Cons: No simultaneous voice and data - Currently the cellular internet cuts out completely whenever a voice call is in progress. This would have been a dealbeaker for me, but supposedly be fixed by the end of the year once Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is enabled by Verizon. No root - Not applicable for most users, but for those who want full control of their phone, there is currently no ability to ""root"" this device and it's questionable whether it will be possible. Form factor - The size and weight doesn't bother me, but if you're looking for the thinnest, sleekest smartphone, this is definitely not it. Other: Voice quality is on par with every other recent Verizon smartphone I've used. Camera quality is fine for my purposes as a casual user, although there are probably better ones out there. Background: I've had the phone for three weeks, owned about six Android phones, including three other Motorolas, an HTC, and a Samsung. The Droid Turbo replaced a Galaxy S4 which developed an internal screen crack after 6 months. It turns out this is a common defect which Samsung refuses to acknowledge (prefer to blame customer), and despite repeated attempts they absolutely refused to honor the warranty for the device. I would have considered a Galaxy Note or S5 but will never buy another Samsung product again after experiencing their extremely poor customer support. I cross shopped against the LG G3 and preferred the feel of the Turbo and the Motorola software.

24503,B07QP7WZ1T,Bryan Kollar,5,30-May-19,True,"3 day batter life? You bet! Well, nearly!","I was sick and tired of my Samsung Galaxy S5 Active phone simply because of the battery life. I had to carry around a minimum of 2 spare batteries because they drained so quickly. So when I found this phone, with 5000 mAH battery, at the incredible price of $200, I couldn't pass it up. I am glad I didn't. It's beautiful! I received the phone on a Sunday afternoon (not that it matters) and had 62% battery life. I had to reinstall nearly every single app, quite a few and too embarrassing to say how many (hence the battery drain, I guess). At the end of Sunday I was down to 25% from extensive usage. So - overnight I charged it. Up at 8 am on Monday. From regular use, I was able to go all the way through Monday, AND Tuesday, AND Wednesday around 3 pm I had to put it on charge because it was down to 9%. AMAZING. By 8:00 it was back at full charge. The phone has a great facial recognition so I just look at it and it unlocks. Or I can use the bio-metric fingerprint reader. Its quick and responsive. Couldn't ask for anything better, except maybe a simple LED light and the Bluetooth headset battery indicator being accurate. It said 62% left, but my headset died within 30 minutes. I fully charged my headset and it STILL reads 60%. I always update my review if something changes, so if this hasn't been changed, then it's still an awesome phone. 8/10/2019 Update - OK, its been months since I had my phone. My rating? Still incredibly awesome. Yes, this is a 4-day battery life phone - if you don't use it constantly. I will say one day I had to charge it only after 16 hours because I was on the phone most of the day. But - other than that, I see no problems with the phone. For example, it's been 41 hours since I've had it on charge and I'm still at 67%. Incredible, and extremely reasonable priced. Buy this phone!! I like the ""turn the phone over for do not disturb mode."" I never have to switch it manually.

The phone they supplied is a Indonesian version and not USA version. Because of this the warranty does not work in USA. When phone stopped working properly due to manufacturer's defect, Motorola said it is not covered under US Warranty and so they refused to replace and Synergy refused also to replace. Fortunately, Amazon has agreed to take it back. But in the process I lost lot of money on this phone and I have sell my Moto Modules on eBay for lesser amount within 4 months. The Synergy claimed ""US Warranty"" when they sold this phone. They are claiming even now with this phone. But it is not covered in USA as they supplied phone meant for Indonesian market without US Warranty. In other words ""Synergy"" has ""cheated me"" clearly with a clear lie. So DO NOT BUY phones from this company. When you get any real problem with your instrument, that is the time you understand. You are stuck with-out US Warranty even if Synergy says it has US Warranty. Do NOT trust this supplier. Feedback on phone: Phone looks great and MODs are very attractive. I am using for last 4 months. My review: Pros: 1. Very thin without Mod 2. Excellent reception Cons: 1. Has two SIM slots and one of them can be used as MicroSD. This is a major draw back because you can use either microSD or second SIM. I felt it as very bad feature and major drawback of phone. Especially when you are travelling outside country or try to use one SIM for personal and another for office. They have left SIM slot position in the adapter but not used it. 2. Battery is very very weak. Moto claims 24 hour but if you use screen (like browsing, viewing any video etc.,) it doesn't last more than 1 1/2 hours. When use I use it browsing, i can see battery constantly draining... 3. No headphones slot. Same slot for headphones and power connector. Even though they included a adopter (wire), it is very inconvenient. You have to carry that adopter always. 4. BLUETOOTH: MAJOR, MAJOR drawback.... I recommend NOT TO BUY this phone. After it upgraded to Adroid 8.0 version, Bluetooth stopped working. Their customer service is really, really bad.. Instead solving the problem, their CS agent says, it is not covered under US Warranty whereas the seller and Amazon said it has US Warranty. Now I can't use it as it is not recognizing any BT Device... I found out from blogs, numerous people have this problem with MOTO Z. AGAIN, with last point and Motorola has pathetic customer service.

Business clients would call and I would not receive the call / text / notification or voicemail! People claimed they could no hear me in calls and since everyone else had me in their phones as being on an iPhone - when the text came thru they were greatly delayed (half apple issue half droid) Problem with droids is they don't get updated for poop after they have been out a few months because there are so many variations that need developed. So besides the software being extremely buggy - the QI charging did not work. The waterproof or resistance factor did not hold up. I got sprayed with a hose and they were in my shorts - DONE! The phone died and I sent it to Motorola thinking it was something else. Since it was advertised as being water resistant - Bull SHHH! They told me it was water damaged and Tough SHHH. I had the original droid and absolutely loved it. THIS is a $600 that I'd of rather burnt. Battery charged fast which was a pro but the battery also died like in no time! Especially now that Motorola had just been sold - no one would back it up. F the carriers for selling such trash! I wouldn't expect this poor of quality from the lowest prepaid phone providers.

22622,B07N91S9MW,Richard A Makepeace,2,3-Oct-19,False,Moto G7 Does Not Make Calls,"Do not buy the Moto G7 if you intend to make and receive calls. I bought my Moto G7 last June from Amazon. Last month, when the phone was three months old, it stopped making phone calls. I was so disappointed that I would have returned it to Amazon but it was by then beyond the Amazon return date. The problem came on suddenly. You initiate a call, listen to silence for an extended period of time, and finally hear a little beep as the call times out. I did this at various times from various locations with the same result. The final straw was when I noticed a voice mail that was just minutes old from a dear friend. I had the phone on me and a check of the call log showed no incoming call...but I could still listen to the voice mail. To be clear, I did my due diligence. I checked the internet for all the information I could find regarding the problem I was experiencing. And to my surprise, a large number of people were reporting the same problem. I did not find a single source with a recommended fix. I did all the usual things recommended: make sure it was not in airplane mode, do not disturb on, reboot phone, but like others were reporting, that did nothing to fix the call problem. It was most perplexing that all my searching found no solution, only more people with the same problem with their Moto G7. I have been a Moto G phone user for years and relied on CNET reviews of the phone which was always their favorite of the budget phones. I owned a Moto G4 initially and loved it so much I upgraded to a Moto G5 when it came out. Right now I am so glad that I kept that Moto G5 because I have put the SIM card back in it and that is my lifeline while I see what will have to be one with my newer G7. The Moto G5 is making calls and working just fine. For anyone interested, I will update this review once I have dealt with Motorola Customer Support. One thing I learned, just getting a replacement phone may not necessarily solve my problem. As I write this review, Motorola is selling the Moto G7 for $50 off the list price of $300. Are they trying to unload these phones before more people learn about this problem? I hope not.

O'Dea,4,3-Oct-12,False,Good phone...not a great phone...but a good phone,"What I like: - ICS (Android 4.0.4) much more intuitive than GB (2.3.4) - Build quality is outstanding - speed of software is FAST! - Notification LED (so many other newer phones no longer have this) - ability to disable most of the bloatware - battery life is very good What I DON'T like: - 4G connectivity (or lack thereof), bar for bar, is less than some other 4G's - power button too close to the volume rocker All things considered, I still think it's the phone I'll be keeping (for 2 years) until the next upgrade. Coming from a Moto DX, this is a HUGE improvement. Cheers q{_}*{_}p ------------------ UPDATE-1: 1 H-U-G-E problem SOLVED: ""- power button too close to the volume rocker"" I purchased the High Gloss Silicone Cover from Verizon Wireless [...]...more on that later...the BEST part is that there's recess for the power button and raised area for the volume rocker, which virtually eliminates the inadvertent (and annoying) power off and/or screen blanks I was experiencing. FYI, the cover is definitely HIGH GLOSS, fits very well, and feels just like a TPU case rather than silicone. As I constantly slide my phone in and out of my front pocket, I need something that slides easy and doesn't collect lint. As case selections are pretty limited now, this is the best option I've found. The case comes in 4 colors, and, if you log in with your VZW ID, you may find a $5.00 discount on this (like I did). I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars just because of this.

The cracks are only visible if I turn the brightness all the way up on my phone and then it just looks like a thin black line. Anyhow, it don't even make sense.

Saturday, it rained all day. I was out visiting and dropped my phone next to my van in a little puddle for 30 minutes before I realized that it was missing and it was raining on it the entire time! I was afraid to even look at it and kept expecting it to just stop working from the water damage for hours. It worked all day Sunday with no issues. And then, I am not kidding you, my son was in the bath and I had to go to work. I leaned over to kiss him and my phone fell out of my hoodie pocket and into the bathtub. I kept wiping at it and shaking it all the way to work, Held it under one of those super max hand dryers for a few minutes and it never even turned off.

3471,B00HPP3QD6,Eric James,5,3-Mar-15,True,It's one of the best phones I've ever gotten,"It's one of the best phones I've ever gotten. I've had extremely expensive phones and very cheap phones. None of them let me do the basic things I wanted to do. I just need to call, text, use social media, occasionally play a game and take the ever popular selfie. It let's me do all of it pretty easily. I like the button that lists all the programs open and lets you close them immediately. The phone has a flash which many non-contract phones don't have. The camera is decent. Unfortunately, there's no option for adding a memory card. But I've had no problem with that so far. I just make sure to delete my pictures every few weeks just in case. I have dozens of programs I like to use (Aviary, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, Flashlight, Lookout, Tango, Wikipedia, Instagram, Facebook, YouMail, FM Radio, Gin Rummy, PicCollage, TouchTunes, Night Light, Pandora, NDRoads, Dubsmash, Timehop, Craigslist, Mixology, Socrative, a few dating/hookup apps (don't judge me) and dozens of pictures and videos and I still have almost half my memory left on storage.

3422,B00HPP3QD6,TGon9505,5,3-Mar-14,True,Please Read!!! Amazing Phone...Wish I couldve used it!!!,"I really did my research on this phone and was very excited about the purchase I made from Amazon! Unfortunately, the very next day when I received my phone, thats when the nightmare started. The phone looked brand new and sealed in the packaging just like you would purchase from the store. For example, I literally had to use scissors to cut the packing to even get to the provided books and then had to cut through a complete different package to even touch the phone. I went through the proper procedures of activating the phone and purchasing a bundle plan for use. Once the phone was completely done programming the customer service rep tells me to make a call and an error message stated the ""PHONE CAN NOT BE AUTHENTICATED"" This happened on February 27th and today is March 3, 2014 AND I JUST LEARNED I HAVE TO RETURN THE PHONE TO AMAZON!! Tthis review is just for ""Customer Beware"" purposes only!! Both Amazon and Verizon Wireless had excellent customer service and tried very hard to fix all issues. HERES THE CRAZY PART!!! I LEARNED TONIGHT THAT THE PHONE I PURCHASED HAD ACTUALLY BEEN HACKED INTO AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE!! Granted, I was upset after almost a week of late nights with verizon reps..it was getting old trying a million things repeatedly to try and fix the phone...but tonight the verizon rep told me straight up ""Maam you need to return this phone, somebody has hacked this phone and resold on whatever site you bought it from""! I was shocked, I told him exactly how the packaging was and literally argued with him because I thought he was nuts. But he was just telling me the truth and even promised a full bundle will be applied to the new phone when I get it. When I contacted Amazon they were just as amazing! They refunded my money and sent me a shipping label for an easy return!!

4849,B00NO2WXM4,Method2Madness,5,3-Jun-15,False,Easily one of the best deals in wireless today.,"First, lets get this out of the way: I'm not tied to any particular brand and have pretty much had all cell phone flavors over the years. My intense praise for this phone stems from it simply being a great phone, not because I'm a Moto fanboy. That being said....with the exception of the mediocre camera and slipperyness of the phone itself (a case remedies this), I have a very difficult time finding anything about this phone I don't like. And I tried. A lot. First off, the Moto X is drop dead gorgeous. I have the white/bamboo and strongly believe this to be the best looking combination. That's not to say the other 10 million combinations are bad looking, they're not. I just think the white/bamboo looks the most elegant. But this is a bit of a moot point, as you're definitely going to want to put it in a case. It's big. And slippery. And apparently doesn't appreciate being dropped onto it's face. I use the ""ElBolt 2 in 1 Motorola Moto X (2nd Generation 2014) Silicon Dual Layer Armor Protective Case "" and am very happy with the fit and finish. Now onto the meat and potatoes.... The 2nd Gen Moto X is simply a great performer that impresses me each and every day. The OLED screen is stunning with PLENTY of resolution. I don't care what anyone says, you don't need a QHD screen in a cell phone. I've compared numerous 1080 HD screens with QHD screens and there is VERY LITTLE difference. But there IS a difference in battery life and price. Which reminds me....battery life. This phone consistently gets a bad rap for it's battery life. But I literally have no complaints whatsoever. I routinely get 12+ hours of use each day with 4+ hours of screen on time and wifi constantly blazing. What more do you want? Just plug the freaking thing in every night. Mine is running Lollipop 5.0 and is lightning fast. No matter what I do, I cannot bog this phone down. I'm sure it can be done, but I've yet to do it and I'm a heavy user. Multasking goes off without a hitch. Signal reception is very good with this phone, as well. I live in a low signal coverage area and in my house, I routinely get 1-2 bars, but have yet to have any calls missed or dropped and even with the low signal get 8Mbps+ of LTE. Although I always use wifi. Call quality is on par with other phones in this range, meaning clear and loud. A side note for all you audio heads, this phone has a great audio amp in it. With a good set of headphones and a good app (powerAMP or Neutron), this thing really sounds great. The included moto suite (moto display, moto voice, etc) are actually USEFUL unlike other bundled apps...(Here's looking at you Verizon.) I use hand wave feature about 600 times a day and am finding more and more uses for the moto voice. Now for the not-so-great: The camera. This is one area where I have to agree with the detractors. It's mediocre. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible and the 4K videos look pretty darn good, but there's a lot of room for improvement. Especially in low light conditions. If you're an extreme photog and absolutely must have the very best camera available in a phone, I would suggest looking elsewhere. But for the rest of us, this camera does fine. In conclusion, you will have a VERY difficult time finding a better phone for the money anywhere. Verizon is currently offering it for 99 cents with a 2 year contract, which is outrageous for this level of features and performance. I'm very happy with this purchase.",4.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X - 2nd Generation, Black Resin 16GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00NO2WXM4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UpiOZp47L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00NO2WXM4,124,0.0,0.0

3325,B00HPP3QD6,Missy,5,3-Jul-15,True,Best Android Phone for the Budget-Conscious,"My Thoughts: On the list to be updated to Android's latest OS Lollipop, you won't find a more up-to-date phone at this price! Pictures and videos are clear and crisp with the Moto G's 720p resolution. The 5mp camera may seem a bit low-end, but it's sufficient for my amateur photography skills. It has 8 GB total internal storage with about 5+ GB available to the user. With no slot for external storage, this may be an issue for some. But again, I personally don't feel the need for more than that. I have never experienced an issue with lagging during gameplay, and streamed video plays smoothly.

Before buying this, I read the reviews and 4 out of 5 people were praising this product. I decided to buy this for my husband for Christmas since he needed a new phone. My plan on my phone was about to expire at the time so we decided we would just rely on this phone. BIG MISTAKE! The phone came in on time. Looked nice and everything came with it as promised. When we went to buy a monthly prepaid plan for it, the phone wouldn't recognize that the phone had a sim in it. That was over $50 down the toilet. The company we were trying to use sent us another SIM card and it didn't work either; phone still wouldn't recognize it. Desperate and in extreme need for a working phone since we have a 2 year old in the house, we took our rent money and bought a prepaid Verizon plan. Unfortunately that didn't work either. As a result we are sending the phone back for a refund. I just hate that it took us 3 sim cards and over $100 spent to realize this is a faulty product. I can't imagine how the seller didn't know this! We finally did what we should have done and just bought another plan for my phone but I just hate that my husband has to go without a phone again. He's a delivery driver and was really relying on this phone. Now we have to wait until tax season to get another. This time of the year, most people are in a financially bind. I usually don't do reviews on here but felt the need to on this one to warn people. Don't buy this product!!! Shop elsewhere; this is truely a waste of money.

3869,B00JS73V2U,J. Miller,1,3-Jan-15,False,Motorola fails at updates. Phone is basically junk,"Basic problems: bad updates, camera fails, screen cracks when cold, nonresponsive. This phone has been nothing but trouble. From day one it has been buggy. First there were random reboots and freeze ups. There only solution (that didnt work) was to do a factory reset. 6 months later an update was pushed out that fixed about 75% of the reboots and freezes. This new update created loads of new problems. Apps would close randomly and the phone would ask for your Google password every 2-3 seconds. Unless your password was 1 or 2 characters long it was impossible to type it and hit submit before it asked again. The only fix was to factory reset phone(didnt work). New update fixed this but with new problems. Now the camera doesnt work. The only way to get the camera working again is to buy a expensive camera app off the store that uses its own drivers (or do a factory reset that doesnt work). Also it started dropping 50% of my calls. Call quality went to crap even with 4 out of 5 4G signal bars. Finally the phone froze up when it got to 32 deg F and wouldnt reboot. I was able to crack the LCD but not the glass when I was pushing the power button to get it to reboot or shut off. Im a big guy but I shouldnt be able to crack the screen with the power button. Although the new iphone bends very easy so what do I know. Im still waiting for fixes for my older Motorola phones. T720, droid 2, droid razr, droid razr maxx and now droid maxx. I keep getting good deals (or free) on these phones but in the end its never worth it.

1367,B0096QYH80,SciGuy,5,3-Jan-13,False,One of the best phones I've ever tested,"Got this phone for my girlfriend for $49 and we have both been nothing but impressed by it. She wanted a small Android phone, but didn't want to sacrifice screen size, features or power. We evaluated what was on the market and went for the Razr M. This phone has definitely made her happy. iPhone's have become the phone most people want when they don't want a massive smartphone in their pocket. The Razr M brings a viable Android back into this space: Size Comparison to iPhone: Razr M Dimensions: 60.9mm(x) 122.5mm(y) 8.3mm (z) iPhone 4S Dimentions: 58.6mm(x) 115.2mm(y) 9.3mm (z) iPhone 5 Dimentions: 58.6mm(x) 123.8mm(y) 7.6mm (z) Screen Size: Razr M: 4.3"" iPhone 4S: 3.5"" iPhone 5: 4.0"" Weight: Razr M: 126g iPhone 4S: 140g iPhone 5: 112g Software: Android 4.1: It was ready for a Jelly Bean update out of the box. Smart Actions: She'll never use them, but I would and I think it's a great addition by Motorola. Circle Widget: Attractive way to display data. She loves it. I have to admit, it looks pretty good. Hardware: Screen: I was worried about the screen based on the technology used, but it looks gorgeous. Radio: I've sat next to her in crap locations while my phone (S3) was on 1X and her phone was on 3G. NFC: NFC makes me happy. Is great for transmitting small bits of data (phones back to back or NFC stickers) and setting up triggered tasks based on device placement (NFC Stickers). Stick an NFC sticker to your GPS dock and have the phone automatically go into navigation mode. To me, NFC alone makes this better than any phone without it. iPhones, I'm looking at you. Verizon's blocking of Google Wallet however, limits the full potential of NFC for now and makes me sad. Camera: The rear-facing camera isn't bad by any means, but it that impressive either if you've used recent phones. I'm pretty sure it uses the same chipset I've seen in phones with better cameras though, so it might get better with an update. The front-facing camera steps things down a notch to the .3 megapixels that I had hoped we'd all gotten past. Don't expect to be taking great self portraits without a mirror. Battery: The 2000 mAh Li Ion is incredible. It keeps this device powered long after most phones (that aren't the Razr Maxx) will die. The Jelly Bean update does lower battery life a bit, probably because of Google Now more than anything, but it still has better battery life than almost any other device. Overall: The phone is a great compact size with a nice crisp 4.3"" display. You're not getting a ""retina"" display, but the only thing you'll probably ever feel like they skimped on is the front-facing camera. I highly recommend this phone and at times am slightly jealous of my gf.

The camera quality is great in daylight, but leaves much to be desired in low light (don't get me wrong though, it's far from being bad). I love the 1080p @ 60fps video recording. The fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate. It has a single front facing speaker, but it's loud and clear. Battery life is good for me, I consistently get over 4hrs SOT. This device charges extremely fast, 0-100% in a little over an hour. I must say that I really love the mod ability concept (one of the main reasons I got this device). The only two mods I will be getting at the moment, however, are the JBL soundboost speaker mod and TUMI battery pack. One major con though is that this device hasn't received a single OS security update since launch (still running July 1st security patch), not to mention the Android 7.0 Nougat update which the Droid versions and other country retail versions users have been enjoying for months now. I had to install it manually, which I shouldn't have to do, however, I will still give this device a 5 star review.

Before I purchased the Moto X 2nd Generation phone, I read all the reviews. They all were quite positive in regards to the software. However, one comment came up over and over again. Everyone seems to warn you that your screen is going to crack on the first drop. I figured I would just get a great protective case, which I did, and that would solve the issue. It did not. On the 16th day of owning my Moto X 2nd Gen phone it fell out of my pocket while I sat in a chair...a drop of what, 2 ½ feet? Even with the protective case the screen cracked! I have had Samsung phones for 6 years, dropped them, kicked them, threw them, never had a cracked screen. On the first drop of this phone, cracked screen! All the reviews will warn you “Your Screen Will Crack On The First Drop”...it took 16 days for this to come true for me. It will cost you $125 plus shipping to get this issue solved. If it happened in the first 16 days from a gentle fall, I’m quite sure it will happen again. Motorola will admit the 2nd Generation phone is “fragile”. The 1st Gen was built like a tank...not the 2nd Gen. Make sure you are reading reviews for the 2nd Gen Moto X as it is different. I’m telling you here, don’t buy this phone. Your screen is going to crack on the first fall. They claim this is “Gorilla Glass”. All this means is it is tough to “scratch”. But crack, just do an Internet search on “Moto X Cracked Screen” and read all the comments. I ignored the warnings in the reviews. I thought a strong case would protect my phone. It didn’t, and now it is $125 or buy a new phone. I’m opting for a new phone and not a Motorola. Honestly, your screen is going to crack. Do the research, read the reviews, don’t buy the 2nd Gen Moto X. This was a simple 2 ½ foot fall out of my pocket...not thrown, not tossed, and it cracked. I guess I’m hoping some folks will actually read this and take the advice I didn’t take. It is now costing me $$$. Oh, I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Motorola.

22246,B07MN8QTK1,Catpsyche,5,29-Sep-19,True,Excellent Phone for an Excellent Price!,"Hey! Wanted to write a semi-quick review of my recent Moto experience with you, but first I'll start by saying, Motorola was my first cell phone purchase back in 1995. And, ""Spoiler Alert,"" I loved Motorola then and I still love them!... I decided to go with the Moto G7 Play (2019) this time around for around $140. My phone before that was a Moto G4 (2016), I spent around $250 for that. It just started acting funny lately, so instead of messing around with it, I just opted for a newer and cheaper version. I'm really glad I did! Three year old smartphones are old by today's standards, and mine had been showing it's wear, and not responding like it used to. So, when I got this Moto G7 Play, I was thrilled to see how quickly it responded, even once ALL my apps were completely transferred over from the old. I had 64GB storage with 4GB memory on my old, and only 32GB storage with 2GB memory on my new, and my new wins out very easily! It does everything I need it to do with no hesitation. Obviously, this is relative to me, but to give you a little more details that maybe relative to you. Here goes!... I have about 55 total apps on my phone currently, and I deleted several apps that were stock on my phone that I knew I would never use. I needed my phone to be Unlocked because I have a Government Sim Card, which mine is AT&T, and it had to work in this phone like it did in my last Unlocked Moto Smartphone. I do grab WiFi Hotspots and do Not keep a paid WiFi provider, so it's important for me while I'm out to cruise the internet, even stream music or stream movies. This phone does all that and more. So, if you want/ need an inexpensive phone that can do anything that the Premium Phones at $800 and up can do --- THIS IS THAT PHONE!!! This is a WONDERFUL SMARTPHONE for people like me... Also, just need to add, that mine was an ""Unlocked International Model"". I did have a slight setup and/ or unboxing issue. When setting up, there was an Update that it wanted to do, but it was all in Portuguese/ Spanish. I already set my phone up for English, and I was troubled at first because I didn't want to have to go through all of this every time I needed to do an update. Called and talked to Amazon, because I'm a Prime member and automatically have a 90 day Product Support with purchase, and they hooked me up with Moto's Support or Buyer that walked me through how to check on these updates. Which is through Lenovo, who makes the phones or softwares. There In the Lenovo/ Moto community pages are constant discussions about all things Motorola and Android. And that update that I couldn't read was an Android, per the sequence of numbers pertaining to the message. This matter was resolved within minutes thanks to Amazon Customer Service & Motorola.

I'm so glad I did. I didn't get mine here on Amazon, but as part of switching from AT&T to Google Fi. Total cost to me was $199. The G7 is a perfectly serviceable smartphone. I'm a software engineer and gadget fiend by nature, but I've never been ""into"" smartphones. I use a handful of apps, take pics of my kids when they're doing something cute, listen to music, and talk and text. The G7 does all of that very well. It is faster than my old S7, runs every app I've installed on it (Maps, Spotify, a banking app, one game just to see how it ran), and the new Android interface is much nicer than the older version T&T was letting me run. The only cons I have with it are that the face unlock doesn't seem to work well (might have something to do with my Google security settings) and the phones single speaker doesn't provide good sound quality. I'm not really that worried about either of those things. In fact, I prefer this phone quite a bit to the S7 Edge, which annoyed me in several ways. The G7 has a better on-screen keyboard and it lets me turn the volume up without a warning.

1271,B0096QYH80,K. Cuthbertson,1,29-Nov-15,False,"Don't walk, run...away from this model.","UPDATE (May 2016): When I finally switched to an iPhone last month -- after the THIRD Motorola DROID RAZR M died in a two-year period (basically every 7 1/2 - 8 months, like clockwork), the Verizon tech who was helping me said this model comes back ALL. THE. TIME. Buyer beware.....(End update) I have loved my Motorola Droid phones -- they are the only smartphone I have ever had, even though others have tried to lure me over to the iPhone, but this is ridiculous. I got my first Razr M in April of 2014, as an update when it was time to renew my contract. I liked that it was thinner than the phone I was replacing (a Droid 4), and it seemed to be a great phone overall. Fast forward to January 2015 -- right at eight months -- and it would not even turn off, but neither would it turn ON. I had been having to reboot it multiple times per day, as it kept freezing. One night during a reboot, it got stuck on the start-up screen with the red glowing symbol...and it stayed there until the battery died. If I recharged it, the same thing would happen. So since it was (thankfully) still under warranty, Verizon replaced it. That was January 2015. By early July 2015, I was once again rebooting my phone multiple times a day. Text messages were not always being delivered, the phone did not vibrate for incoming calls when it was on vibrate (so I missed a lot of important calls), and it was generally undependable. I took it in to Verizon and they examined it, telling me to remove a few particular apps and do a factory reset. Ibdid, and within a week, I was back because that had not fixed anything. So in late July 2015, the phone was replaced AGAIN. It is now the end of November -- just four months later -- and this third Razr M is driving me bananas. It reboots itself randomly (sometimes several times a day), I have people telling me they get the same text from me more than once , I find others have sent me texts I never receive, it once again does not vibrate on incoming calls when I have set it to vibrate....I am just DONE. I can understand a phone here and there having problems, but three models of the same phone in less than two years that cannot make it more than eight months before dying?

22633,B07N9LN3RC,S. F.,5,29-May-19,False,I wasn't prepared to love this phone. Totally WRONG!!,"When my much-loved Samsung S7 was damaged and ""died"" I had to get a new phone. I’ve had Samsung phones for years but at the time I couldn't afford a new Samsung S9 much less the S10. I ""settled"" for this phone because the price was right (under $200.00 for the unlocked version). I've only had it for a couple weeks and have not regretted the purchase for a moment. The antenna is superior - my old phone would only work in certain places in my home; now I get a good signal everywhere. Other than a few seldom-used Samsung apps - like Samsung Pay - the phone does everything I want it to do. The picture quality seems great though I haven't printed any so can't compare to other printed photos. The battery life appears to be amazing - much better than I could ask for. I love that you can not only tell the time but how much battery you have left plus the date when you just pick up the phone. The sound quality using the speaker is OK for calls. I only listen to music with ear buds or bluetooth speaker. Maybe ""stereo"" speakers (which it doesn't have) might make a difference but hey, it's a cell phone not a Bose music system!

22524,B07N91S9MW,R. Ploude,5,29-Jun-19,True,The Moto g7 turned out to be a better phone than I had expected for the price.,"There are a considerable number of questions regarding this cell phone's WIFI Calling ability. Without a phone tower anywhere nearby, this was the one 'must have' features for me. The phone's description did say that wifi calling works with the TMobile network. Consumer Cellular was very helpful and offered to switch me to a TMobile sim chip if necessary. Consumer Cellular uses either the AT&T or the Tmobile networks for their customers. CC is a reseller of those networks. Fortunately for me, wifi calling worked with the AT&T network chip that I transferred from my iPhone 7 to my new Moto g7. Now, how about the rest of the phone's features. The battery life is fantastic! Not running any battery eating background apps for extended periods, I get two days on a full charge. Most of my cell phone usage is digital as I make or receive very few calls now that I'm retired. Online news apps, exercise tracking apps linked to my smartwatch, texts, emails, music, and online research are my primary uses. If you spend a great deal of time on the phone, you may experience a slightly lesser battery life, although, you'll get at least a full day out of it, something my iPhone 7 couldn't give me. A feature that I didn't think much of when I read about it is the ability to turn the flashlight on and off with just a chopping motion while holding the Moto g7 in your hand. It certainly proved handy recently when I needed a light to unlock my entry door at night. You can similarly turn on the camera with just a twisting motion of your wrist. Again, a convenience in that it saves me having to unlock the screen and punch the camera app when the need arises to take a quick picture during my morning nature walk.

3468,B00HPP3QD6,Al,5,29-Jul-15,True,Moto G vs Lumia 635 Comparison,"Just got the Moto G from Amazon. It's a fantastic phone. My first impression was it is a lot heavier and sturdier than my mostly plastic Lumia 635. Both phones are equally zippy without hiccups. Due to the slippery back cover of 635 I dropped it a couple of times, the phone immediately became pretty dinged up after the couple very light drops. The SD card reader quickly stopped working and I had to get it fixed. That's not the case in my experience with Moto phones. My Atrix 4G was dropped about a thousand times during the 4 year period of ownership. Never had a problem, barely a scratch. Moto G seems to be even sturdier than my Atrix. Call quality wise Lumia is much better. One of the best call quality I've seen on any smart phones. This coming from Apple, Moto, Samsung and Blackberry usage over the years, says a lot. Skype calls come through nice and clear as well. That's a big plus. Moto G has decent call quality, nothing to complain about, but if you wanna use Hangouts to make calls that's nearly impossible. I placed about 4 Hangout calls, people on the other side all reported horribly garbled voice quality, to the point they could not make out most of the words I said. Skype calls do seem to perform okay on the Moto G though. Camera wise Nokia's beautiful technology holds true here. Lumia 635 takes vibrant pictures as a 5mp shooter without a flash or front-facing camera. All my Lumia pictures are a joy to look at. Moto G pales in comparison despite the fact that it has a flash and a front-facing camera. Pictures taken with Moto G look washed out and out of focus. Battery life wise both perform pretty much the same. Lumia has a replaceable battery but it's really expensive to get the original ones, currently they cost about 20 bucks, half the price of a new phone. I'm hoping to upgrade my Moto G to Android L soon, hopefully the battery performance gets even better. Prepaid options are many for both phones. I use Lumia 635 on AT&T's MVNO and Moto G on Verizon's MVNO. Both get pretty wonderful reception. If you have strong Sprint coverage in your area, TextNow just released a Sprint CDMA Moto G and the price is wonderful. If I didn't have to travel I'd go for that one for sure. Expandable storage wise Lumia 635 takes up to 128gb SD card. That's a lot of media and it might also slow down the system. Moto G has a built in 8gb memory, no expandable SD card slot. I don't use it as a media player so that's plenty for me. All in all, I feel like Lumia 635 is probably not gonna last 4 years like my Moto phone did due to the build quality. It's a shame because all my Nokia phones last well over 5 years. Moto G seems to maintain the standard Moto quality which is wonderful to see.",1.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

Several websites tell you to take off the back of the phone to put on the grip shell. Do NOTdo it! Both Best Buy and Verizon said it would invalidate the warranty if you take off the back.

4846,B00NO2WXM4,Matt Turner,4,29-Dec-14,False,Best User Experience and Software Anywhere - But a Mid-Grade Camera,"There is no such thing as ""the"" perfect smartphone since each individual uses them differently and will have different requirements or preferences. So before I get to the details, I'll let you know my own. I've used iPhones for most of my life, but recently got bored with iOS and went on a long, expensive, chronically and unreasonably dissatisfied hunt for more interesting phones in the Android world. I value a well-balanced phone with: 1) Clean, quick, uncluttered software with a pleasing user interface 2) A camera that can stand-alone as my one-and-only camera (low grain, great exposure, decent color reproduction, decent HD video) 3) Premium build quality that can please an Apple-seduced ex-iPhoner (feel-in-hand is especially important to me) 4) A bright, colorful, and sharp screen 5) Full day battery life I also care about durability, prompt software updating, and accessory availability. I use the Sony Xperia Z3 as my go-to phone, and have also recently owned the iPhone 5s, LG G2, Google Nexus 5, HTC One M8, and Sony Xperia Z2. My wife uses the Samsung S5. I bought the Motorola Moto X pure, unlocked version through the Motorola moto-builder site. As a disclaimer got a Bamboo back and Blue trim, so be warned that while I've felt the leather in stores I had a very slightly different experience. I've used the phone for two weeks. Okay, on to the review! 1) Software: 100/100. I've never awarded a 100% to any phone for any feature. Until now. Motorola and Google absolutely nailed it. First, you'll get the phone at Android 4.4 KitKat, but 5.0 Lollipop is already out for the Moto X and the phone can (and should) be updated immediately. Stock Android Lollipop is gorgeous, colorful, and adds many small changes that, when they come together, makes the software almost perfect. Props to Motorola for keeping the phone stock. The few features that Motorola has added (all found in one app) are genuinely useful. The Moto X has excellent voice-activated commands with a customizable command phrase that actually works consistently. It also knows where you are and adapts accordingly; whether you're driving, sleeping, in a meeting, or having family time, you can customize how the phone notifies you and interacts with you given your current activity. You get nice and customizable lock-screen notifications as well. This is the smartest smartphone I've ever used, by far. Also, Google Now is omnipresent and is a decently useful (if creepily predictive) feature. If you care about software above all, look no further. The Moto X is the phone for you. 2) Camera: 83/100. Like the rest of the phone's software, the camera app is smart, pretty, and quick. You can flick your wrist twice to open the app, an experience that is quick, pleasing, and works consistently if you can remember that it exists. Though not actually Google's camera app, the camera software resembles it in its minimalism and de-cluttered UI, which I really like. Also, shutter speed is one of the fastest I've seen, rivaling the iPhone. So it's not all bad. And while I'd read poor reviews about the camera, I was willing to give it a chance. And note that my standards are very high. Unfortunately, though, the images I got were just not consistently solid. In bright outdoor light you'll get nice, colorful, decently sharp images. In any other light, however, images are often blurred, sort of grainy, and discolored. The phone lacks Optical Image Stabilization, and it shows. Though the camera is 13 MP, the images were much less sharp than on the 4 MP HTC One or 8 MP iPhones. If you compose the photo, you'll get a decent image half the time. If you don't, it's more like 1 in 4. And try as you might, you'll have to fight hard to get a really, really good image that you'll want to print. The flash (which, by the way, is not a ring but is just two LEDs) is bright but doesn't solve the camera's low light issues, producing red-eye and off-tone colors. Video is better, but not amazing. I'm honestly sad about this, but it was a dealbreaker for me personally. If you're no shutterfly and just need the occasional quick snap of pets or kids, the camera will do the job. If you're at all picky about images though, you'll be chronically dissatisfied. Sad, but it's the one-and-only true weak point on the phone. 3) Build Quality: 96/100. This is a gorgeous phone. And the range of customization options (Soft leather? Warm wood? Either, please.) is nothing short of brilliant and will turn more heads more than any iPhone. The curved back feels great in the hand. The Gorilla Glass is smoothly rounded around the edges. The metal rim is eye candy and feels awesome, if a tad slick. The aluminum speaker and camera trim is nice, whether stock or colorfully customized on Motorola's site. Look, it's just a stunner of a phone, at least on par with the HTC One and Sony Xperia line with much more personality. 4) Screen: 90/100. OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screens are interesting. Instead of a backlight, each pixel produces it's own light, giving the screen a unique, warm, saturated feel. Coming from the ultra-bright Sony Z3's LCD panel, the Moto X was quite a change. Colors are bolder and more saturated, and much warmer. Browns and colors look great. And since OLED screens produce black by simple turning the pixels off, blacks are inky-dark and contrasting colors just pop beautifully. It's a nice screen, and the resolution at 1080p is as sharp as I could ever care about. My only real complaint is that the screen is dim, at about half the brightness of its competitors in nits produced (whatever a ""nit"" is, don't ask me). You get used to it fast and it saves battery, but coming from the brightest phone on the market it was a little underwhelming. I could get used to the rich OLED colors very fast though, and the deep black will certainly be missed. 5) Battery life: 85/100. It's fine, but nothing to write home about. Android Lollipop saves battery well, as does the dimmer screen and well-done notifications. I'm a heavy smartphone user (ahem...addict), so I never get more than one day with any phone. This phone will get you through a workday, but if you're like me then you'll need a quick charge in the evening to get you through bedtime. Note: Invest in a Qualcomm Quick-Charge 2.0 charger, supported by the Moto X. Just do it. It blew me away! You get 35% battery added in just 15 minutes. Plug it in during your after-work shower and you'll have juice to make it through Friday night, no problem. Summary: If you're somehow still reading this, here's the final verdict. If you don't care too much about camera performance, or prefer a stand-alone camera, just stop and buy this phone. It's fantastic in every single other way and costs less than rivals. Personally, I'd go through the Moto Maker website for free customization if you can stand to wait a week for delivery. If software and UI matter most to you, you'll be smitten by the scrappy Moto X. And if Motorola can come up with a better camera, I'll buy future versions of this phone in a heartbeat.",49.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X - 2nd Generation, Black Resin 16GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00NO2WXM4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UpiOZp47L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00NO2WXM4,124,0.0,0.0

I have never been more disappointed in an electronic device in my life. The first one I bought displayed the dreaded green line that has been decided to be a defect of manufacture. So after many calls and arrangements made, I returned that first phone to Motorola. They charged me $25. for shipping and put a $300 hold on my credit card until the defective phone was returned to them. Then, even before the first hold was taken off my card, the replacement phone (which was probably a refurbished) had more problems than the original. It changed the time of day, the voice services went off, email stopped sending and I could not communicate with my home security system which sends messages to my smart phone. So, I returned the second phone. Another $25 and a SECOND hold of $300 against my credit card. I'm talking $600 hold on my card now!

The camera is decent but if you care about picture quality that much just go buy a standalone camera. The battery life is good enough but thanks to quick charging it is never an issue.

I do have a problem with ""Ghosting"" occasionally. I suspect the phone was returned under some warranty and then resold. For those that don't know the term ""Ghosting"" is when the phone starts to activate apps or the screen jitters in a quick and endless loop as if a ghost were tapping the screen. I did some online research and found it's a flaw in some of the Motorola phones and has something to do with the phone getting too warm inside...not outside the phone.

7262,B0192XJ0P6,Soundtallica,3,28-Sep-16,False,"Solid, but meh","There's nothing wrong with this phone, but it's just uninspiring. Yes, its screen is shatterproof, its performance is very reliable, and Motorola's software skin is great. It works as it's supposed to, and that's always a good thing. But the Turbo 2 is chock full of minor niggles that aren't deal breakers, but when added together drag my enjoyment of the phone down. It doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. It won't receive many updates because Verizon. The camera is decent in good light, but in low light it falls apart and it doesn't have manual controls or OIS to alleviate the problem either. The vibrate motor on my phone failed after 8 months (luckily Verizon was good about getting me a replacement). It's full of bloatware that can't be uninstalled but can be disabled and hidden. It's great on battery when it's on standby, but the screen hits the battery hard. And the value on this phone for resale drops like a stone probably because Motorola isn't as big as Samsung and Apple and because it's a Verizon exclusive. Overall, the Turbo 2 is a good phone, but not a great one. It's like a Toyota Camry: utterly reliable and dependable, but ultimately boring. It'll get the job done, but doesn't go the extra mile.

I am not one to buy a new phone just becuz the new version is out. Apple did not break any new ground with their updated phones so I stayed with the 3gs. After time android caught up and surpassed iOS in my opinion. I was tired of iOS but android was also an unknown. After considerable research in best bang for buck and my 3gs refused to recognize all the charging cords I had for it I pulled the trigger on the Razr M shortly after it was released. Amazon had it for $50 and that was a hell of a deal to me. Amazon has it for .01 cents now. Wow!!! In short its a great awesome phone and I love it. Get it. Its a breathe of fresh air compared to iOS. It's small and sleek, has a great screen, and hasn't dropped a call yet. Read on for the negatives. There is a learning curve. If you are remotely tech savy its easy and refreshing. If not, than stick with iOS. I don't mean that as a knock on iOS. Apple products are just easier. Rudimentary but easy. Anyways, I had big problems dealing with SD cards. Major hassle. I sent 2 phones back to Amazon becuz of issues. Let me explain. The 1st phone I received from Amazon had fingerprints and gunk on it. WTH? I called them and asked them if they sent me a refurbed phone. They said they dont do that but they would replace the one I had via the 30 day return policy. I never even turned it on. I just put it back in the box, printed the return label, sealed it, and sent it back. The 2nd phone arrived. It came in a cushioned envelope... not an Amazon box. Odd i thought, but it was still in the Motorola box and was at least clean. I turned it on and I was happy. Until...... I had it for about 2 days and loved playing with my new phone. Then I decided to get a micro SD card for it. 16gb class 10 for about $20 at Fry's. I put the SD card in. Everything was ok until I decided to take a picture and set the default to save to the external SD card. Bad news kid. Phone crashed and locked up. The phone hated the SD card. I exchanged the micro SD card at Fry's thinking it was messing up my phone. No dice on the new card. Phone kept locking up. Bought a new Sandisk SD card from Office Depot thinking the off brand was the culprit. Phone locked up again and kept doing so. In desperation I reformatted the phone. I got the hang of doing so everytime it crashed. Which was every time I tried to access the external memory. I was pissed. So..... Called Amazon and complained thinking maybe I got a bum phone. What luck huh? Begrudgingly they agreed to send a 3rd one. Kudos to Amazon I suppose. 3rd phone arrived. In preparation I researched online about my problem. It was a 2-3 week old phone so not much was out there about it. I read a little about micro SD cards and came across a thread about the SD card and how the phone was tested using a class 4 SD card. I bought one at Office depot for about $16. 16gb, class 4 micro SD card, and waited for my phone to arrive. Crossing fingers and trying to get my 3gs to charge. Phone came. New Amazon box, new Motorola box, clean phone. So far so good. Popped the 16gb class 4 micro SD card in and fired the phone up. Took a picture with the default set to save to the external SD card and crossed my fingers............ Its been a little over 2 months now and I love this phone. The lesser classed SD card did the trick. It takes pics fine and saves to the SD card fine and fast. With the class 10 SD card the phone would lock up every time an app would try to access it. Now with the class 4 SD card, everything is fine and this phone is awesome and I mean that in a tech way. Its sleek, sturdy, and high tech. I even bought the Motorola car dock and use the Smart Actions. I learned how to use Smart actions and vehicle mode. I updated to Jelly Bean. This phone amazes like watching your dog behave in public. Jelly Bean and Smart Actions make this phone do tricks you wouldn't expect. Sometimes u have to setup some stuff up but doing so helps it learn you faster. I love the android Navigation and Jelly Bean voice. I find ways to use the Navigation. The android voice gives directions as if I had my own personal Cortana! Sorry for the long review but I hope this rant helps some who might have had problems with the SD card thing as well. Get a class 4 or similiar card and be happy with this phone.

It seems that these international phones have problems with LTE connections. Tried to find solutions via Google to no avail.

22196,B07MF3JM4T,Bill L.,5,28-Jun-19,False,Best Motorola in this price range!,"Bought this phone from Amazon UK for around $230 USD because we live abroad and I wanted it to have a warranty in Europe (instead of no warranty). Did lots of research and all the Moto One models (not the Chinese P30 Play) have the same LTE bands. Definitely didn't want to pay $399 from Motorola or Best Buy for the US model when there's much better phones in that price range. I previously had a Moto G6 from Google Fi that was great, but very sluggish at times. Even though the Snapdragon 625 used in this was used in the previous Moto G5 Plus, it's much faster than the Snapdragon 450 in everyday use of the Moto G6. Apps load faster, no slowdowns in multitasking, etc. But I'm pretty sure the camera on the Moto G6 is better. But the shutter speed is much faster on this device. So all the professional reviews talk about the 720p display being a con, but I have to say that it's barely noticeable that it's not a 1080p display. It's a very nice panel. Colors are good. You have to look very closely to even see a difference in text. I also own a Google Pixel XL with a 2160p display and I actually prefer this device. Yes the other is slightly more crisp, but the 19:9 ratio is much easier to hold and colors are easier on the eyes. Watching videos, 1080p movies etc, still look great! Performance is great with the 4gb memory. Don't see any difference in app launching and multitasking between this and the Snapdragon 821 in my Pixel. Of course this is not a phone for hardcore gamers, but as a useful dual SIM reliable all-around phone, I highly recommend it! Oh and if you love Motorola, go with either this or the Moto X4 because Android One is the way to go. Motorola will only give one full OS update to even their flagship devices now unless they're Android One. Overall it's very comfortable to hold, performs well for people who don't want to buy a $800+ phone with tons of features they don't use. I'm living in Central Africa using it on the two networks that are available here, AirTel and Tigo. Gets great reception on both, clear calling. Also used it on Google Fi (T-Mobile) while in Paris. Added a 400gb SanDisk micro SD even though it says it only supports up to 256gb. Works great and stores most of my Google Play movies and music. Get this phone! You won't be disappointed!

Mine's black, and I bought an optional blue back to make it easier to find. After 13 years, I've been able to walk away from Verizon Wireless, and their cartel-ish rates and policies. I don't necessarily need a new phone every 2 years, and if I don't, I don't want my payments to go on forever, after the phone has been paid for. I also love the freedom to be able to change carriers if I find I want to. The ~$200 Moto G unlocked phone made this possible. Also, and this is hardly trivial, the reviewers are right. This is a terrific smartphone by any standard. It feels good in my hand, is small enough to be used one-handed, has a bright, sharp display that I can read, and seems to have none of the bad habits or slow reactions that used to corrupt Android phones. The hardware is powerful The LTE works great. The micro-sd card gives me +32mB more storage for about $16. I connected mine through Cricket. I went to the Verizon store, paid up my bill, and told them to expect my customer relationship to end. They were very friendly and professional. I then took the Moto G to the Cricket store, where they signed me up for a month-to-month relationship, transferred my old telno, and downloaded my contacts from the Verizon phone to the Moto G. They installed the SIM card, and tested everything out. I would be paying $50 a month for my Cricket service (unlimited text and talk, up to 2.5GB of data per month), but I save $5 off that because I gave them an auto-pay with my credit card. If I used Verizon, that would cost about twice that amount. They have cheaper and more expensive plans. Cricket runs on the AT&T network, and seems to be everywhere I go. At home, I can't even get voice service with T-Mobile or Sprint, so those service providers are o-u-t.

18825,B07CHWMYHP,Sean Bova,5,28-Jul-18,True,Fantastic phone at a great price,"I upgraded to this G6+ from a G5 I've had a little over a year. I want the dual-sim option, as it makes things easier when I travel to Europe just to pick up a local sim at the airport to save my wallet (and make it easier/cheaper for my EU friends to reach me when I visit). While the overall size difference from the G5 to the G6+ isn't huge, the fact that the bezel on the G6+ is much smaller, it makes the viewable screen quite noticeably larger. The design changes are a huge improvement for me over the G5 models. The glass back gives it the look & feel of other higher end flagship phones, yet still in the budget-mid price range. Takes awesome pictures (for a phone) and there are a lot of cool features/effects with the camera that I'm still on the learning curve of figuring out. The 2.2G processor, combined with the upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo makes a HUGE difference in how fast and smooth apps load and run compared to the older G5. The battery capacity might not be as huge as some others, but I haven't found it to be a problem yet. With moderate use of phone calls, texting and running apps, I get a full day use out of a full charge, and by the time I plug it in at night, I usually still have somewhere around 20% left, which I feel is a nice cushion for times when I need to use it more. The only drawback for me (but not enough to knock an entire star off) is that it doesn't carry an IP rating for dust/water resistance... I would have liked to seen an actual IPxx rating rather than ""p2i coating"" that doesn't carry ANY rating. Obviously this isn't a phone that can/should be submerged - but without an actual rating, there's no indication of just what type of exposure is or isn't safe. That said, there are several cases available for this phone that are capable of full submersion, so if I ever get the urge to go snorkeling, I'll just get one of those.",11.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 Plus - 64GB - 5.9"" FHD+, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1926-7 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Plus-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHWMYHP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511i4Qx+e2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHWMYHP,185,174.94,184.99

9821,B01LEL8ABY,Amanda,2,28-Jul-17,True,Well built phone with poor support and bad battery,"I've had this phone since December. Over my time of owning the phone my opinions have changed drastically. At the moment, unless you want to have a battery mod on the phone 24/7, I do not recommend this phone. [Screen]: The screen on this phone is definitely one of the highlights of the phone. Its a nice size (5.5"") and has good viewing angles. Its a 1440p AMOLED screen and looks fantastic on the vibrant setting. Colors pop and text is very sharp. It does get pretty bright, but could still stand to be brighter as it is hard to see in direct sunlight. It also doesn't get very dim, so using it at night can be blinding. [Build and Design]: This is a well build phone, most Moto phones are. Although this is the thinnest smartphone ever, it feels rock solid. Probably the best built phone I've owned beside my old HTC One m7. The design, however, is where things fall short. Its a fine looking phone, but has some problems. First, the big one, no headphone jack. This is a trend that needs to stop. The headphone jack is not some old, out of date port. Its a headphone jack. No point removing it at all, not a single reason. Although having 2.5d glass looks and feels nice, it does expose more of the glass to damage when dropped. It also means that tempered glass screen protectors will have to be smaller than the screen. Although I love having a super thin phone, I don't think it is worth it which I'll explain later. Another problem is the screen to body ratio is not very good, this phone has huge chins. There's also a MOTO logo right on the front of the phone, which looks pretty tacky. The back metal is a pretty big fingerprint magnet. [Camera]: Its OK. Motorola is not known for not having great cameras, and this continues the trend. Pictures look good when in good lighting and after a bit of tweaking, but in any other light its pretty below average. It uses a pretty old sensor, the Sony IMX214, which was actually used in the Nexus 6 and OnePlus One. Video quality is pretty good though, especially the 4k HDR recording. Overall its enough to point and shoot type stuff, but if you really like using your phone for taking pictures, you'd be much better off with something else. [Connectivity]: I'm using this on AT&T and have also used it abroad too. Abroad it worked great, I was able to easily connect and switch networks and maintained LTE coverage the whole time. Back in the US, however, its a different story. Up until June everything worked fine. Since then, things have been different. Now, it is very rare that I will connect to LTE. Instead, it seems to default to H. Switching APNs, changing preferred network type, factory resetting, and updating the phone have not fixed this issue. Now I'm stuck on H. [Sound]: I love having a speaker on the front of the phone. Not as nice as having dual front speakers, but better than bottom speakers. The sound quality from the speaker is pretty good, but it doesn't get that loud. As for headphone output, its good and bad. It is nice and loud, which is nice as I've used some devices that are very quiet. The sound quality, unfortunately, isn't the best, probably because of not having a headphone jack. Audio through the USB C port is scaled down to 16bit quality instead of the standard 24bit audio. Audio is still pretty clear, but bass is lacking, even with EQ. About that EQ, the EQ is very limited. Its just a measly 5 band equalizer that you cant even customize, there's just a few presets you can choose. Once again, overall its just alright. [UI and Software]: The UI is fantastic. Moto has the best skin out there. Its pretty much stock android with a few great tweaks like moto approach, gestures, and customizing your OK Google phrase to anything you want. Because of all this this phone flies through the UI. Software updates is yet another blemish on this phone. They are very few and far between, with the model, the US unlocked variant, being to last to receive all updates for the most part. Moto has said that they will not be committing to the security updates, and that is one promise they have kept. I have only gotten 2 updates since I've had the phone, one for 7.0 and one for a security update. And, seeing how moto has treated some of their other phones, I wouldn't expect too many more updates for this phone. [Performance]: This is a very good performing phone. I believe it is the fastest SD820 phone there is. However, ever since the nougat update, I get a lot of stuttering sometimes and a few app frees and crashes, mainly settings and camera. Overall though, its still a great performing phone. It does get very hot. Even with light use (I don't really do any heavy use since I don't play games on my phone), it tends to warm up a lot, sometimes enough to even be uncomfortable to hold. [Battery]: Finally, we arrive at the battery. When I bought this phone, I didn't expect it have the best battery. I mean, it has a 2600mah battery. That's pretty laughable for any size phone nowadays. This is the thinnest smartphone ever made, so there has to be some tradeoff. Well, when I got the phone, I was actually amazed. I was easily making it through the whole day without needing to charge and was consistently getting over 6 hours of screen on time(SOT). This was way better than any phone I'd had before. I had a battery mod, but rarely needed to use it, mainly put it on when I was traveling or when I knew I would be away from a charger for longer than a day or so. This continued for a few months. Those were some good months. Then, I received the update to Android Nougat. From there, I immediately noticed a drop in battery (and yes, I did a clean install). I went from averaging 6+ hours SOT to about 5 hours SOT. Standby drain also increased. Not a huge decrease, but was still disappointing. Over the next few months, it has only gotten worse. Now, I average about 3 hours SOT and have a standby drain of almost 4% per hour. The phone also gets hot more often and according to AccuBattery, I only have 81% of my original 2600mah battery left, making it effectively a 2000mah battery, smaller than my HTC One m7 I had years ago. I haven't made it through the day without needing to charge in weeks. Its extremely frustrating and disappointing. The battery mod is required now, and I don't like that. The battery mod should be something that you use when you need to extra juice, not to make your phone usable . Just based on this alone, I would stay away from this phone. [Moto Mods]: Moto mods are a really cool idea, and definitely the best implementation of modular smartphone technology. The execution is not quite as great. There isn't anything wrong with the mods really, except for the camera which actually has a worse sensor than the built in camera, its more the price. The style shells are priced fine, they're pretty cheap. The speaker mods are a bit expensive and a standalone Bluetooth speaker will definitely sound better but they are very convenient. The battery mods also shine with their convenience and ease of use compared to a standalone backup battery, but you do lose out on charge speed and capacity( you can get a 30000+mah backup battery for the price as the battery mod, which is 2220mah). I do think it is a good buy though if you can get one on sale or from ebay. Like I said above, the camera mod is way too expensive and worse than the stock camera except for the zoom. The projector is also really nice, but yet again you trade quality for convenience, soft of. I don't mean the build quality is bad, but for the same price you can get a much much better projector that works with all your devices instead of just your phone. I also say you get more convenience because while it is more convenient as its attaches to your phone and just shows what's on the screen, you cant project a movie or anything and use your phone for something else. Overall, if the mods were all cheaper they'd be a great buy, and they still are, but you have to be really committed to the Moto ecosystem to justify the price of some of them. If you are looking for a Z series phone, this probably isn't for you. Go with the z play or the z2 play, they are just better phones.",36.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

The ability to expand memory with a Micro SD card along with a headphone jack are always great additions. The phone is a beautiful design, in my opinion. The glass back gives it a nice heft, but it is glass- mine has a hairline fracture on it. The camera is fine; though there are much better ones out there. The 3 gigs of memory is *just* enough, but it does chug a bit if there are a bunch of apps open. Personally, I'd upgrade to the 4 gig model for a few extra bucks. One very cool feature is the fact it works on nearly cell network globally. I use Verizon in the US and travel fairly frequently- any SIM I pop in (in New Zealand, Canada and the Caribbean) has worked without a hassle.

4832,B00NO2WXM4,The_Blacked_IPs,1,28-Jan-15,False,"This is gonna be a hating rant, rant lovers dig in!","What in the world did I just buy for $550!?!? Is this really what Motorola calls their ""Flagship"" model? This phone is truly pathetic in so many ways Im about to start a rant rather than a review. Short version: Don't get this phone if you think the voice commands is what you're gonna use. Don't get this phone if you think you are gonna watch videos you take on the phone with you on PC or larger screens. Don't get this phone if you use phone as a mass storage device. Don't get this phone if you think Motorola's 24/7 Live Chat knows this phone at all. Don't get this phone if you think because you are paying a lot you are getting a lot. Don't get this phone because it is a flagship model its gonna be good. Don't get this phone if you think those 2 metal strips are BOTH stereo front facing speakers that sound good. Don't get this phone if you got convinced by Motorola that they installed minimal bloatware as possible. Don't get this phone if you think Wood and Metal is a good material to have on a phone. Don't get this phone if you think the camera is gonna be any good. The rant: Well I was really hyped I saved up for an expensive phone to have one of them Flagship models in the market. Lot's of good reviews here and there coming up. The more I read the specs the more I loved this phone without even having it! Kept reading each and every spec of the phone, on paper this is an IDEAL phone but this is the real world and it seems the engineers at Motorola they got a memo where it says ""Cut every corner you can, make this phone worth less than a brick"" because simply thats what you get for a phone at this price, a brick! The marriage- I walked in my phone service store, I was extremely excited about getting this phone. Wish I knew this was a gold-digger! As the salesman was activating my phone through the system I was in admiration and attempting every feature I knew about the phone. I tried the flick of the wrist to activate the camera, no it didn't work. I tried voice commands OK Google, Hello Moto X, Hello Android... nothing. At least Motorola's described minimalist was in the Lockscreen there, the lockscreen didn't load wallpaper or anything just the Time and Lock logo everything else was a black screen. I was ok with that although I prefer an easy shortcut directly to Phone or Contacts. As he is putting in my SIM card, I give him my microSD card and he says it doesn't have any. He then asks didn't you read it in the specs? Heck I read the specs so many times it hurt my head but 1 thing is reading ""MicroSD is not supported"" in a spec sheet and another was my case where Motorola maliciously had the storage expandability HIDDEN so we don't see the truth behind it. It looks better in a spec sheet no mention whatsoever of a microSD/expandability than a row of microSD: Not Supported, N/A, zip, nada, nuthing in the spec sheet doesn't it? But I said well I got myself a 16 GB phone what would I possibly care about capacity!! All I need is 14GB so I did math I could eliminate 1 or 2 camera videos I shot and I would have 2 or 3 GB for my apps and multi media messages, right !? WRONG !! DEAD WRONG !! When I came home, connected it to Wi-Fi it started downloading upgrades, I went into the storage to set the USB options and DUM DUM DUM!! I couldn't find it. Where are the USB options? And as I am looking through every menu in the Settings App I notice the available Storage... brand new phone nothing in it and it is 8 GB available ONLY!! On a 16GB brand new phone all the user gets is 8GB. This is downright false advertising, Motorola can say all they want that Android and pre-installed apps take space all they want but truth is this is the FIRST phone I have that doesn't give me the space advertised. Even my cheap Coolpad Quattro II said 4GB and I have available 3.93 GB now THAT's truthful advertising. On this 16GB phone that you pay more for, you get half, that's right, 8 GB for you. Well 8 GB doesn't sound so bad does it? Cant be that bad right? right!? Oh wait, there is NO expandability, no USB options and no microSD that means those 8GB get shared with all your contacts, multi media messages including sent videos and images through texts, anything that comes in through your bluetooth, preinstalled app updates (yes even those will continue murdering your storage) , cache and config settings, and THEN you get your space to put your things in like your own apps, your own videos, your documents, your pictures. All this is having a knife fight in your phone's storage and guess what... there's no rules! You always end up losing no matter what the phone always wins. Pre-installed apps take priority! The phone will make it so that space is NOT yours. Motorola claims they minimized the bloatware so the phone runs like your phone, not a turtle, yet there's Mx Games app, Hangouts, Google+, 2 different music apps, 2 different image apps, 2 different mail apps, 2 different internet browsers, what part of having 2 of each is actually ""MINIMAL"" Motorola!? Lets start getting things in shall we? Plug in USB you get 2 options, as Media Device or as Camera. This phone will not connect as a Mass Storage Device. So if you plan on simply drag and drop a selection of files from your phone into your PC's playlist to view in a large screen this is your first and last warning YOU CANT. You have to double click, this will forcefully make a copy in a temp folder on your PC of THAT file you wanted to open into your PC. Yes it will fill up your PC's temp folder by simply trying to watch stuff from your phone on the PC. I was surprised that all the sudden everytime I ran the cleaner on my Antivirus the utility would clean up 6GB, heck once it got up to 21 GB and all this was the damn phone copying into a Windows temp folder everything I ever played on my PC from the phone. If you are ok with the phone doing this sort of thing and having to constantly wipe with a software that wipes temp folders then go ahead get this phone. How about creating playlists? Want them to play one after the other in a playlist? Nope! It has to first copy the file into the computer and then it adds 1 file at a time to the playlist. This is a ""Media Device"" remember? There's no creating playlist or direct watching here, this is the first smartphone I have that has ever done that. Even my LG Spyder II as old as that thing was, knew that you should be able to play directly from the phone. Motorola thought of something new, wood and metal on a phone, gee on paper sounds so good having trust-worthy quality materials to protect your phone. This thing slips and slides and both the wood and the metal add the weight for the phone to just have a hard on for that floor. Every night of every day the phone is just aching to fall to the floor. It hasn't happened yet, each time that slips is a constant reminder to place it exactly in the middle of any surface, but thats not enough! Even a tiny thud on a table will send it sliding to the edge. This phone was meant to fall. A 15 minute call will strangely tire my wrist too. What do you think of Motorola's idea of having wood and metal on a phone now? Let's play some media on the phone, it being a ""Media Device"" and all, it must sound pretty good with those 2 sweet speakers on the front. I wasn't surprised cause I read the spec sheet was 1 speaker, so even if you see 2 Stereo speakers in the front you are actually getting one. Is it loud? Well loud enough. Is it clear? Hell no. The camera, lets try that now. Did it shoot? Yea, it actually did good after configuring the Moto Actions to work with the camera and it took OK pictures just not spectacular but I didnt buy an expensive phone for the camera now did I? Its the phone's key features to Assist you, like it will auto-dim the screen when you are not looking at it. Doesn't that sound so cool! It works to a mediocre degree and once it dims it doesnt brighten back when you focus again on it, it dims even if you are looking at it so I went to configure that in Moto app and it has a very neat app there which shows a face when the phone knows you are looking at it. So I tested it and failed more times than it worked. The face wasn't showing when I was looking at it most of the time. Couple's counseling -Now I called up on support so they would tell me what I need to do to get USB working as mass storage device, to clear up space and get a apps menu white background glitch solved. I was surprised they had 24/7 live chat support, but believe they arent any good in any sort of way if they dont know about the phone. I talked about USB mass storage device, I got a generic macro reply linking me to Motorola Device Manager so while it was installing I left that one at that and continued chatting about the other issues. Clearing up space, I got a generic reply linking on how to free up space which was clearing MY files off the phone basicly. Yes Motorola's genius solution to making space is get your movies, pictures and music OFF your phone. Not the useless games pre-installed that I will never use or the redundant apps I got 2 of or the built-in Hindi Korean and Philip language packs support or the talk back accessibility, no, those have to stay... to eat your space and be useless. The break-up - I got this phone because the key selling point is its completely hands free Voice Commands. On paper its completely hands-free, you can just say the pass phrase then the command and its arguments and it will do as you say. One gigantic problem though, the mic sucks. You have to be no more than 3 inches away from the mic in a dead silent environment for it to recognize your commands. What's weird is the phone will recognize humming so even if you don't SAY the pass phrase but hum the right way it will wait for input. How about in a busy environment you may ask? Don't expect it to work, ever. Funny thing is IF I plug in my Klipsch headphones which do have a better mic the voice commands work without problems so there is no denying that Motorola's key feature was completely blown away by the mere fact that the mic is so cheap and sub-standard that a generic mic from a in-line remote on a headphone is better than the mic of a $550+ smart phone. People tell me I sound different through calls. Now tell me, if the KEY selling point of this phone is supposed to be the seamless Google voice integration with completely hands free voice commands would any of the smart people at Motorola bother to think they should invest an extra dollar on the bloody microphone? I guess there aren't any smart people over at Motorola, they couldn't even invest on the key selling point of a flagship model.",10.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X - 2nd Generation, Black Resin 16GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00NO2WXM4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UpiOZp47L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00NO2WXM4,124,0.0,0.0
14913,B074VFRKZG,Mirakurun,5,28-Feb-19,True,My precious,"So, I haven't owned a cell phone in almost ten years. I think I owned the very first generation of android. Why? Mostly because I work from home at my computer all day long, and I've just paid for the ""bundled"" phone+internet that entire time. So as a complete noob when it comes to modern cell phones, I'd have to say I'm extremely please with this phone. It holds your hand through setup-the Republic Wireless sim card was easy to install-I was able to get it fully updated and connected with my cell service in less than an hour. The body of the phone is beautiful, metal and glass, which I immediately covered in a case and screen protector. I'm very pleased with how you can sync up everything to the different google services so easily, like for example, the photos you take can automatically sync up with google photo for storage. I'm sure most of you have been taking advantage of such convenience for years, but for me it was pretty amazing. The camera is totally decent-I like how you can activate the camera by twisting your hand twice-so you actually have a chance to capture some photo or video quickly. I bought this phone over the new moto g7 which just came out because it was $100 less, still has a very fast processor, and has that upper middle class of phone build quality. The fit and finish on these phones is just impressive. I've always liked the way that Motorola streamlines its software.

14671,B072ZWCKP5,Kirk-RS,5,28-Feb-18,True,"Best deal in smartphones, bar none!","Although nearly too large for my favourite belt bag, this has proven to be a very capable CDMA smartphone running on Verizon Wireless towers via the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) reseller PagePlus brand of America Movil. Since bringing it online at the beginning of Nov. 2017, it has performed close to flawlessly. Best features: sometimes sold unlocked so that it can be used on either GSM or CDMA networks; simply enormous run-time due to it being the largest lithium polymer battery (5000 mAh) currently available in mobile phones; fingerprint security access; windowed screen (2 apps running simultaneously) under Android Nougat; 32GB internal storage with sdcard port for up to 256GB additional storage for personal files. The large battery makes the phone a bit bottom-heavy and slightly difficult to handle one-handed, especially if your hand is small like mine! That makes a protective case and screen cover just about mandatory. These accessories will set you back another USD $30-$40, but they more than make up for the cost by protecting your investment in the phone. While this phone is a real bargain -- currently ranging from USD $160-$250 new; some carriers like Boost offering it locked to their system for as low as USD $80) -- particularly when compared to the Samsung and Google brand phones costing hundreds more, it still isn't exactly cheap. Protection plans may make sense, but they come close to costing as much as the hardware in this instance. I prefer protecting myself in other ways. One great option is to round up an older Sprint or ATT phone and set it up on FreedomPop.com. For $8 a month, I get 200 minutes talk, 500 texts, and 500MB of mobile data -- unused data even rolls over up to a total of 4GB. With my old LG G3 CDMA on FreedomPop, any issues with my Moto (mechanical or service related) can be dealt with or endured with some creative forwarding of voice and text while I keep going with my backup phone. So I'm clearly a big fan of this phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles (no NFC if you're into swiping your phone like a credit card to pay for things; no 3D rendering for fancy virtual reality apps), but if you want a rock solid device that does the basics and quite a bit more, and want it to run literally for DAYS with a bit of frugal power management, then look no farther! EDIT 2018-03-01 -- Amazon no longer sells this phone directly. What a pity! I guess it reflects the crazy instability in the mobile phone market. Yet I find no ready replacement or successor for it on Amazon, even setting aside the matter of price. The big battery is simply not found in any model intended for the USA market, which I hope still matters to Amazon! Heaven knows whether the phones coming from China + India are truly reliable. (It's true Motorola is just a brand for Lenovo of China, but at least the company is well adapted to selling in the USA market.)

8459,B01DZJFWWS,Josh Parker,1,28-Feb-17,True,Why did I do this to myself again?!?!,"Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I just came from a horrible run with the G4 Play, I went through 4 of them, all with defective GPS. After less than 2 months I gave up on replacing it over and over and got my money back. So what did I do? I bought the regular Moto G4, which has functional GPS. Having GPS that actually works was nice. After a couple days the random waking started. Usually while it was charging, but not always. Face up or face down. The phone would just wake itself up for no apparent reason. There would be no notifications, no movement near it, it just decided that it wanted to be on. This wouldn't have been so bad, but it would never go back to sleep on its own either, even after many hours. The 3rd time I caught it doing this it had happened overnight while sitting unplugged on a table and was down to 3% battery. On the 12th day (today) the ghost touches started. I was walking along and it started spamming the home button. I have ""show touches"" enabled (a habit I formed after dealing with the ghost touch issue of the OnePlus One), so it was very obvious what was happening. I had my other phone on me and took a video of it. It stopped after I put it to sleep and unlocked it again, but it started to do it again 10-15 minutes later. A quick Google search when I got home and this issue is likely bigger/more common than the defective GPS on the Play. Nope, nope, nope. I'm not even going to try a replacement this time, or 3, or even waste my time again with Moto support (zero response from them on any of the defective G4 Plays), and just return it to Amazon for refund. I really wanted the G4 play to workout. It is the only phone I had found that has a very completely set of supported LTE bands across the main 3 carriers and wasn't $700+. Unfortunately it seems that each edition of the G4 series has their own major defect(s). I don't know what happened to Moto. My Moto X Pure was pretty good (sans overheating and weak battery life issues). I think I'm done with Moto phones for good now, they clearly can't seem to make a device that doesn't have massive issues with the basic functionality. TL;DR: In a sample size of 5 phones in 2 months, the G4 and G4 Play (and likely the Plus) series has a 100% defect rate.",52.0,Motorola,Moto G (4th Gen.)

22717,B07NP2Y82Q,Buyer,4,28-Apr-19,True,Would buy again (LTE/4G Works),"First off, let me put to rest other reviews that say this phone does not work with LTE (4G). **IT DOES** When I took mine out of the box and put my sim in I was not seeing these speed, though. I did a little reading and found a reviewer that said they had to upgrade the Android OS before seeing LTE speeds. I connected the phone to wifi, did the OS update and it has worked flawlessly ever since. I had it running on AT&T for about a week, and now have just ported over to Mint Mobile (3G/mo $15/mo 12 mo prepay) and it is working very well. I just did a speed test and got 53M up and 23 down. That is more than enough, imo. To upgrade the OS, go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> System Updates. Follow the prompts and restart once it is complete. I am a long time Samsung user (since the Galaxy S2) and was very used to the Samsung interface. One of the things that intrigued me about this phone was that I read it was very close to stock Android. It took me about a week to become agile with it, and I am still not all the way there, but new habits are being formed and I am comfortable with the interface. Everything is laid out logically, so when I go to look for something that I Samsung had customized, I am able to find it- sometimes with just a little more effort (the Settings -> Search function has become a go to tool). The phone is plenty fast. I added a 128GB memory chip and am swimming in space. I added a second sim for a carrier in Latin America where I travel frequently so when I in the airport I can browse over to their website an buy a data plan sufficient for my trip. Then I am able to redirect all data usage through the second sim while allowing the primary sim (Mint Mobile) to receive texts/calls in roaming mode at a per min rate. The screen is beautiful. The audio is really really good. I was very impressed the first time I played audio with the speaker phone… This thing sounds great (I normally use Bluetooth speakers or headset). The fingerprint reader is quick and functions well. It is somewhat awkwardly placed in the rear of the phone as other reviewers have mentioned. I find myself pressing the camera lens sometimes in an effort to unlock the phone. It is a pretty good way to get the camera lens dirty. The camera works well and although I am not terribly interested in much more than point and shoot photography… I am thinking about diving in and experimenting/learning all of the available features- I understand that this camera is very capable and I have admired the photos I have taken thus far. All in all, if I had it to do over (at the same price point) I would buy this phone again. I can’t think of a better review than that, folks.

This phone randomly will not ring for incoming calls. Very common problem with new Motorola phones if you search online. No fix I can find. Seems like a firmware problem. Restart is only a temporary fix. UPDATE 1: The voice network problems I had was my own fault (user error). This phone has slots for two SIM cards. I put my SIM card in the number two position instead of the number one position. I started having voice access issues again, so I looked at the instructions. All the instructions that came with this phone are in Spanish only... but the pictures were enough to help me. Works fine now. Original Review: My family plan is on Cricket and I've had my eye on this phone for a while. I really like the idea of Android One, which is a slimmed down, basic Android operating system that doesn't have all the bloatware that comes from manufacturers. I did have some difficulty activating voice calls on Cricket. I had to call Cricket support, but after I ran all the system updates, everything worked eventually. I advise that you run all the system updates before you try to activate the phone. So far, I'm quite happy with the phone.

14966,B074VFRKZG,AR,2,27-Sep-18,True,Not worthy of the X name,"Since T-Mobile upgraded it's towers/service, my Moto X 2nd gen from 2014 could no longer receive texts/calls reliably. Forced upgrades suck big time. I had already been pseudo shopping for a new phone, but what was available didn't seem as good or not much of an improvement over my old Moto X. I wanted another Moto because I like the gestures and generally feel that Moto does a good job of keeping the bloatware to a minimum. I also did not want some YUGE device which seems to be the going trend, so the Moto X4 seemed like one of the few viable choices. Despite the general underwhelming reviews, I decided to try it out. After using it 2-3 days, this thing is no Moto X. It's a Moto G or a lower model in disguise. Pros: -Flash/Flashlight is brighter -Camera seems better, more features, manual control, etc. -Somewhat better battery life Cons: -Call quality is worse -Screen is the same size as the Moto X, only with yuge top/bottom bezels (!?) so the phone is bigger, and that makes the screen feel small -The screen doesn't seem as vibrant -Android 8.1 seems more cluttered than 6.0, and by no means performs any faster -If using a different wallpaper, and swiping up to unlock (instead of fingerprint sensor), the stock wallpaper still shows (?) abiet briefly -Glass construction is a dumb idea -Huge camera lens on the back of the phone that protrudes from the body -Available cases are mostly ugly or stupid looking Sorry Moto, but you peaked with the older Moto X.",24.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X4 Factory Unlocked Phone - 32GB - 5.2"" - Super Black - PA8S0006US",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B074VFRKZG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159JihtggL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074VFRKZG,184,261.84,0.0

1386,B0096QYH80,cubsfan,5,27-Sep-12,False,Only thing that could make it better will be the JB update!,"I've had this phone for 3 days now and love it! My previous phone was a Droid X, which was a great phone, but the new Razr M has the same screen size, way faster, is smaller overall, and lighter. I was looking at the other Razr phones and the Samsung S3, but they where all too big for my taste. When I saw the M I knew this was what I was looking for. Big screen in a small light package that fits in your pocket with ease. For reference it is the same physical size as the new iPhone 5, but with a touch bigger screen and much smaller price tag. I think the screen is crisp, bright, and clear, despite what I have read in other reviews, and I don't see any pixelation. Battery life has been amazing. I'm currently at 47 hrs since recharge and still at 35%. This is with heavy use still setting up apps, ringtones, etc, and about 1 hour of talk time. I'm thinking 3 days will be possible once I get to more normal usage and less playing with my new gadget. Super fast. Dual core 1.5GHz snapdragon CPU with 1 gig RAM means it will run apps with ease. I am amazed at how quick it is compared to my old phone which wasn't exactly a slouch. If your used to ICS OS then this phone will feel very familiar to you. Coming from GB OS on my X was a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to the new Jelly Bean OS that is supposed to be available shortly. I had to give up my unlimited data plan (or pay full retail price to keep it), but I don't think this will be a problem. I'm using less network data than my old phone thanks to the ""Smart Actions"" that can be set up. It automatically switches to Wifi when GPS tells the phone that I am at home or office. Nice! About the only negative that I think of is the location of the power button. It's just above the volume up button and I have already hit it twice while trying to turn up the volume. I'll get used to it in time.

1355,B0096QYH80,Jan,5,27-Oct-12,False,Flawless,"Coming from another Smartphone that was very buggy, I just wanted a solid performer. Something reliable that works. I've had the RAZR M for a little over a month now and couldn't be more pleased. All the major functions work without a hitch, the phone stays on (yeah, well, the old one didn't), the telephony seems to be great, and the service through Verizon is much better than what I had with ATT. GPS locks very quickly, even indoors. Snappy processor... without drama (no overheating, shutdowns, etc) Very good battery life... go about two days with bluetooth, wifi and GPS on and about 2 hours air time Apps run smoothly Voice quality very good with handheld or speaker phone and folk on the other end like it too Reception/coverage area very good Android 4.0 implementation is excellent Build/feel/hardware is great (solid, smooth and minimal but not too slick, great size Screen is great 4G is lightning fast (equivalent to cable modem at home), and 3G is pretty good too. If there are any areas that this phone is not as good as it's predecessor that would be in the camera and the voice recognition. Both of these functions work, and I would not call them flawed, but they are the two areas where I don't see marked improvement over my 2 year old now retired dinosaur. The camera seems to lack an anti-shake feature, and produces images that are noticeably inferior to my other phone. On the other hand, I am a photo guy, and it is likely that for most folk the differences are immaterial. It does have the dual camera feature, though I haven't tried it yet myself, and video is reasonable for a phone. The camera software is much improved and very intuitive. I have read that you can buy a camera app that improves the performance and may look into that. The voice recognition works, but for some reason I seem to have speak louder than my normal speaking voice. I don't think this is hardware, because for phone calls on speaker phone people hear me fine. Probably something in the Android version/implementation. All in all, I would have to say the RAZR M fires on all cylinders right out of the box, and is a joy to own.

22602,B07N91S9MW,ActionXPotential,5,27-Nov-19,True,Much better than iPhone 5,"I bought this phone to escape the tyranny of Apple, as a replacement for an iPhone 5 that has recently been forcibly outdated. Keep in mind, my frame of reference is based on 5-year old tech, however that old phone continued to serve its purpose until recent updates. Pro's and Con's of this Moto G7 are as follows Pro's: 1) Fast and responsive 2) Sensitive fingerprint reader 3) Up-gradable storage with Micro SD made it easy to transfer all my backed up iPhone files (including music). 4) Android operating system is a major upgrade compared to iOS 5) It seems to function and perform comparable to my fiance's Iphone 11 in most respects, better in some ways, worse in others. however the camera function pails in comparison. 6) Battery charges so dang fast Cons: 1) Its very large compared to iPhone 5. Looks funny in my pockets 2) Feels fragile, had to get a good case 3) Battery life is mediocre. Turning off unused programs/services and functions like Bluetooth dramatically increased battery longevity. I am not a huge phone user, so seeing the battery get around 35% by bed time was a bit concerning. My iPhone 5 battery still lasted longer after 5 years of use. (This may just be how phones are today owing to the increased resolution/pixel density, GPU's and processing power, clearly im not a good judge). 4) Despite the rear camera's 12 megapixel capacity (same as iPhone 11), the true function is a bit sketch. As others have warned, it does not take good pictures in medium-to-low light. In good lighting the pictures look great, however shadows can stick out quite pathologically. Overall I am very satisfied with the product, keeping in mind that the weaknesses mentioned above are an acceptable sacrifice in quality for the cost of the phone. If you are trying to take near-professional quality images with a phone, this is not the product for you. Other than image acquisition and a mediocre (but acceptable) battery life, you likely wont notice any performance differences from higher-end phones.",1.0,Motorola,"Moto G7 – Unlocked – 64 GB – Ceramic Black (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, & Metro",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-G7-Unlocked-Warranty-T-Mobile/dp/B07N91S9MW,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Vobb06FVL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N91S9MW,361,179.99,299.99

1369,B0096QYH80,Tarcas,5,27-Nov-12,False,Excellent,"I upgraded to the Droid Razr M from the Droid yesterday, and so far I'm very happy. Much faster than my old phone, and the battery seems to last far longer too (not that I had much trouble with my old Droid.) I've replaced the stock launcher with Launcher Pro, which I had been using on my old phone. The Plus upgrade transferred over easily also. Since I replaced the stock launcher, the interface is almost identical to what I am used to. The main differences are listed below: The power button was moved from the top right to the right top. Not a big difference, but I've already found that some of my habits don't work anymore, like picking it up in such a way as to turn it on simultaneously. It's also a little harder to find with my finger, but I'm still sure I'll get used to it. The charging port was moved from the left top to the left bottom, and rotated backward. When I'm in my car, I plug in the phone and place it vertically in the cup holder where I can see it without moving much more than my eyes. Fortunately I have a cut-out on the side of the cupholder in my car. If I didn't this would definitely cause a problem. If you have a similar habit, check whether this will still work for you. The port is only about an inch from the bottom of the phone. The menu button doesn't always display. This is actually a good thing, because some apps don't use that button, and this way you can tell if there's actually a menu. The search button has been replaced with a recently used apps button. I'm not seeing this being more useful, but truthfully, I don't think I used the search button very often, and there is now a Google Search widget. Not necessary on the old phone because of the button, but I guess they decided that this would be better. The ring tones aren't very good. Of course, this is just my opinion, but none really sound to me like ""my"" phone. Or even ""a phone"" for that matter. I guess I'll go find an app for that later, but in the mean time I'm using my old ringtone. The notifications are better, but I haven't found a way to set one for gmail separately; it just uses the default. Settings are easier to navigate. Or at least prettier, with a smaller font so more fit on the screen. Anyway, I think this is better. I like the Smart Actions app. I do like that it lets me change settings on things like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mobile data, screen brightness, volume, etc based on a trigger like connecting to my home Wi-Fi network, being (or not being) plugged in, time of day, battery level, and/or not moving for a while. Still working on making it work right for me. My biggest complaint so far is that there seems to be no way to detect ""in the car"" besides connecting to your car's bluetooth (which I don't have.) My wish is that it could check speed, or disconnecting from Wi-Fi. Speaking of which, for some reason it wasn't able to use my location because it couldn't determine an address... even though it could place me correctly on the map. Not sure why it needs an address to tell if I'm within a certain distance of a given location. So, Smart Actions has its pros and cons. If you don't like it, don't use it. If you do, you can make basic actions like turning the volume and brightness down at night, and then back up in the morning. You can also make more complex ones using numerous triggers (e.g. being plugged in and connected to wi-fi and in a certain location.) Having ordered mine from Amazon, it came with several Amazon apps preinstalled, and a few other shopping apps that I'm not familiar with (my wife said one sold shoes... whatever.) Take this as you will. For a $99 price difference between Amazon and Verizon, I'll accept a few extra unremovable apps for the next 2 years. Edit: I've now had this phone for about a month and a half. As expected, some of the changes I've learned to deal with, like the power button placement, however I still prefer the top placement, as the volume buttons are harder to find accurately this way. As for the charging port, the change of orientation no longer bothers me as much, but I still wish it had a light to indicate that it was actually charging. I really like the recently-used Apps button now. It helps the phone act as a multitasking system. Think of it like a version of the task bar on a Windows computer, that shows all your running apps... only it's not just the ones currently running; it also shows the ones you've recently started and exited (so if you really like a certain app, you can quit and instead of finding it on a desktop, you can quickly find it there.) I've also gotten to love the Google Now features. These include cards that tell such things as how long it will take you to get home or to work, what the weather forecast is, the details of your upcoming flights, and what events are coming up in your area. There is also a search bar in the cards view, so it's a quick and easy way to do a google search. I've turned on a setting so that I just have to drag the home icon up to activate it, so I no longer miss the search button being always on the screen. This is just as convenient. Still loving Smart Actions. Still frustrated that there's no good way for it to tell that I'm in the car. The phone is still fast and smooth. Unfortunately the 8 GB preinstalled only has 4 GB usable for apps, and you can't install apps to the SD card. I'm at about 1 GB of the 4 GB app limit. I can't yet predict whether I'll hit the limit before I'm done with the phone. I'm irritated that the limit is so low because I like my technology to be future-resistant. It's definitely enough for now, but over time, requirements tend to grow and I expect that for many, possibly including myself, they will outgrow the capabilities of this phone. I see this 4 GB limit as the bottleneck.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

At the end of the day, it usually has 20-30% left (I've only had it for a few days, so I'll have a better idea in a few weeks). My only complaint is the screen. It's a pentile, which makes edges between objects rough. It's kind of hard to explain. I think my old Droid X had a better screen in this regard.

22497,B07N91S9MW,Debashish Mitra,2,27-May-19,True,Disappointing,"This phone was disappointing - I have used Moto G, Moto G2, Moto G5 Plus earlier in the Moto G series and also OnePlus, Samsung Galaxy Note, Huwaei devices, LG flagships,, Sony Ericcson flagships and a host of other midrange and budget phones. I was currently using Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 and so that phone is my reference for this review. The Asus cost me about 190 USD in 2018 including tax (i.e about 140 USD less than the G7 including tax) and it was an amazing value for the money - a 6.2 "" bright, accurate crisp display, decent camera, amazing battery life (5000 MAh battery - 2 day battery life), fantastic premium feeling build (smooth sleek metal body, well built). I bought it while I was in India - the budget smartphone market in India is extremely competitive and you get amazing devices at unbelievable prices compared to the US market. The only reason I had to look for a new phone was because the Asus was not fully compatible with US carrier bands. I chose the Moto G7 based on my previous satisfactory experience with Moto G phones and the reviews which said it was one of the best budget smartphones in US market. I was thoroughly disappointed - not only comparing the G7 to the Asus but even to the previous Moto G phones. Here are my impressions of the Moto G7 after using it for about 1 month as my only and main phone. Display - Washed out, lacking in brightness and saturation. The Asus was way better in terms of brightness, color, accuracy, sharpness. Sound - Bad. The speaker is too loud and harsh for itself. At full volume the sound cracks. No wonder there are so many complaints of the speakers going out after a few days of use - did Motorola even test them thoroughly ? Does not seem so. Even putting the volume to max during navigation would hurt your ears due to the high pitch cracked sound. Even the Moto G5 Plus has a much better well rounded sound (at least does not crack at full volume) Build Quality - Not too bad but the Asus is way better with its premium metal feel. Fingerprint reader - Not bad. Was decently responsive Feel and Handling - The glass back is too slippery and the phone gives a feeling that it will slip off from the hand any time. I am extremely careful with handling and have hardly ever dropped a phone ever (unbelievable but true) - and I rarely use protective casing or screen guard because I feel they take away from the beauty of a phone - but even I felt extremely nervous using this phone. I was forced to get a protective cover without which this phone seemed unusable. I have seen reviews where this phone cracks easily on drops so that is even worse. By the way - the cover I bought was very good and totally changed the handling experience to one of assurance and satisfaction w.r.t the grip and sense of security. Camera - Decent. Took good photos outdoors with adequate light. Battery Life - Now this was the real deal breaker. Battery life on the Moto G7 was terrible. I am an extremely light to moderate user and expect my phone battery to last at least till evening. I use my phone only for occasional calls (very infrequent), text messages (very infrequent), zero social networking except very light WhatsApp (max 4 times a day for a few minutes), web browsing and news (light to moderate), YouTube (light to moderate). The Asus last me around 2 days on a full charge. The Moto G6 Plus last me a full day. This phone - the Moto G7 lasted half a day at most ! This was totally unacceptable given my light usage. I had to carry the charger everywhere I went for the first time in my life ! I can attribute this low quality issues to cost cutting because clearly even the Moto G5 Plus was a much better built and better quality phone and there are way way better budget handsets in other more competitive markets like in Asia. I really really wanted to like and keep the Moto G7 but I had to return it because of it's bad battery and unsatisfactory overall experience.

14679,B072ZWCKP5,Aikya Shah,5,27-May-18,True,Using since January 2018: Great Battery life and works fine with ATT Sim,"When I moved to the US this January, I did not know that my phone would be incompatible with US carrier bands. I had to look for a phone that offers a lot of battery life, has a fast enough processor so that it does not hand and has sufficient memory and a decent camera. Moto E Plus offered exactly that. I wanted 64 GB but my budget was limited. I chose an unlocked phone (since I might switch my network in future) and put an AT&T Sim, which is working as expected. The battery almost never dies, I charge my phone like once in 5 days or so. My phone does hang, but very rarely, probably twice since I bought.

4479,B00MWI4HW0,Techie,2,27-May-15,True,A not too bad budget phone,"I bought this phone in mid December and after using it for about 6 month, im writing this review hopefuly it will help the new buyer to either make the purchase or not. First i would rate the hardware as 4 since this is the best phone for 179 $ you can get as of right now, this phone has a beautiful design, and with it's 5 inch 720p screen you cant go wrong. Browsing and reading web pages looks sharp, and the videos looks sharp as well. The rear camera is good and taking pictures is fun with this phone but do not expect something close to high end smarthphone. The front camera quality is not as good and i wouldn't recommended it for selfies, it is only useful for video chatting when needed. The speakers are good qnd loud enough to listen to music or talk in speaker phone mode. Multitasking is not smooth specialy when using this phone with the extremely buggy lolipop 5.0.2 and only 1 giga of ram, and it can be really frustrating when opening apps, and the phone start lagging and freezing if you dont reboot your phone once a day. The processor is fast enought to open webpages, play regular games, opening apps. Thia my rating to every part of the phone Screen 4 stars Speakers. 4 stars Front camera. 2 stars Rear camera. 3 stars Processor. 4 stars Design. 4 stars Operating system ( lolipop 5.0.2) 2 StarsStars I hope that this review is helpful to everyone.

26199,B07WSJYDXX,Tracy,4,27-Mar-19,True,"overall, a keeper - but longggg charge times, some cumbersome typing. A+ sharp video","I want to upfront say something about WiFi calling and this amazing device: I had a SIM form a company that uses AT& T towers, which unbeknownst to me were frequently down in my area. I was able to make calls and use internet, text and did not notice anything amiss for the first couple of days after activating Moto - until 2 nights in a row I had 0 bars, no cellular service, at my home. I then noticed no LTE emblem either, just 2-3 bars when it was functioning. After much ado and online chats and a trip to Target for a new SIM, it was discovered the culprit was AT&T and the fix was to switch me to T-Mobile. But - Moto had AUTOMATICALLY gone into WiFi calling, I did nothing - and I am lame in technology so unsure who or what they used for this WiFi service, but I was all over town able to apparently make WiFi calls - not just at my home base. So I thought that was outstanding, that my SIM was not functioning as it should yet I had plenty of service, for a good deal of the time without doing a darn thing to initiate that. The audio volume, speakers on mine are perfect. I didn't buy a stereo and I also did not buy a camera....that said, video provides clear sharp images that are nice and bright. I did have to do a lot of updates at first - but Moto was VERY polite and patient. They let me choose when to begin each update, and warned me of not being able to use the phone at times. It also did each update in 2 phases - the download and the install, each time asking me before it continued. So I could download one, then wait and do some calls and come back to install that one. It took about 2 hours all together but I was doing things in between the updates as I saw fit - unlike Windows updates on my laptop, I was not locked out of my phone, nor forced to let it sit and update endlessly with out a clue as to what is happening. I really appreciated that. Moto has given some really nice features that make a cheap Galaxy phone look prehistoric. I use many, to many to think of right here but I certainly like to use the chop flashlight, the 2 shakes camera on, the fingerprint on and off. The face recognition didn't work for me; it says the light is bad no matter what I do. But some things do bug me, some more annoying than others. I hope some of these things can be learned by me as I keep looking for answers, in the meantime, it is not a bad phone at all and I do not regret buying it, not one bit. I happen to believe that no one is perfect and so to expect something to be 100% perfect is asking too much. (A) Motorola says in the bullet points ""get hours of power in just minutes of charging"" yet it takes 2 hours for my battery to get a full charge even when the battery is drained; I thought it was supposed to be super quick to charge when drained but I guess they think 2 hours is ""minutes?"" (B) Photos are cumbersome to manage - I cannot seem to find an easy way to archive - which function, screen is it? It is like playing a game of clue trying to find the right combination of options to manage photos: store, put into albums, archive, etc. There is the main photo view and there is the separate Google view, but to much of it is NOT obvious or easy (for me) to figure out, and the onscreen help leaves a lot to be desired. (C) When I press the right side square button to show all ""prior apps accessed"" and want to clear them all, I have to click-close each one, one at a time - then on the very last one it finally gives me the Clear All option!!! Why does it make me close 10 windows then on the final 11th let me clear all?? (D) Another similar Clear All issue affects the pull down notifications screen. The Clear All option is hidden (I guess) because I can't find it until I open gmail, or whatever, to get rid of some of them so that the Clear All option is visible - so all these notifications build up without seeing the Clear All option, only a small annoyance but I think the Clear All options should be there even when and especially when the screen is crowded. (E) Keyboard is a bit cumbersome, could be a lot more user-friendly: 1. the comma is right up next to the animated emoji and I do not have pencil thin fingers so I too often have to cancel the jumping flashy emojis to try to get a comma in. 2. I must keep pressing the shift up key to make caps - it should press twice to put caps lock on but it does not seem to have a caps lock feature. 3. It does not give us an easy way to type email by way of @ and .com buttons on the main keyboard. 4. I wish it had a gmail button instead of having to type it out each time. 5. I don't like having to toggle to 2nd keyboard to type a number, because the keys across the top won't let me access the numbers without pressing some other special function key each time.",6.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

3445,B00HPP3QD6,Keith H.,3,27-Mar-14,False,Outstanding Android. Mediocre voice quality.,"My thirty days are up and I am sending it back. Sadly so. Incredible android performance at this price point. No freezing, glitches, slowdowns or problems of any kind. Day and a half battery life with modest use. This is a very solid device that is fun to use. I am not going to nit pick it to death since that would not be fair. If you buy one you get A-LOT for your $100.00. My only real issue is the voice quality of my sample. My ten dollar Samsung Gusto prepaid flip phone blows the Moto G away in voice quality. Words have a slight buzz on them at the earpiece and a very slight buzz attached to them going out from the mouth mic pickup. I like it enough that I may explore some blue tooth options to see if it is possible to get around the call quality issue. I may also try another one just to make sure it was not my sample. Call quality can fluctuate quite a bit throughout the day on the Verizon network in my area. The time of day, my device, the tower, other peoples devices and carrier, it all adds up to a lot of potential variables. When the stars line up and everything is perfect, the call quality of this device is just barely good with most of my calls falling into the mediocre to poor range. Other callers say that I sound OK, but on my end I have to keep asking people to repeat themselves. It can become really frustrating and makes talking and driving more dangerous than it already is. I will not answer this phone while driving. Any android device I use must excel at being a phone first. This one does not. All of my comments about voice quality are specific to my sample of the Verizon Moto G prepaid device on the Verizon 3G prepaid network. In general there seems to be an overall decline in the voice quality of the Verizon network. Even in Consumer Reports magazine I see their phones are not scoring like they used to for voice quality. I don't know if it's a network issue or the way they spec out their devices. In the 90's to mid 2000's I could always count on Verizon devices for top notch voice quality. Today it's getting harder and harder to find one of their phones that sounds really good. I hope they can find a way to reverse this trend since it's one of the fundamentals they built their business on. If voice and photo quality are not important to you and you don't mind the limited storage capacity then it's highly recommended. The Moto G is a very pleasurable android experience. UPDATE: 6-4-14. Bought another one just to make sure it was not an issue with the first sample. Call quality on my end is still OK to poor. Calls are not usually very clear but they are usually understandable. The Moto G is an absolute delight to use as long as I don't need to make any phone calls with it. My only other issues has been that the screen is hard to see in bright daylight. In direct sun it is totally unusable.",45.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

When I first got this phone I was switching from an Apple phone. Over all this phone tops my iPhone. I can download tons more content and get access to music without having to pay out the butt. It is far from fancy like the newer samsung devices, but you are able to use it for more than just a phone. The camera is pretty great. I have not yet filled up my storage and I have downloaded tons of songs and I have loads of pictures and apps. It has great sound. There are tons of updates that have bettered this phone since it first came out and since it is setup with google it continues to update. If there is something missing there is always an app that can fill the void. I also find that this little sucker is pretty durable. I have dropped/thrown/tossed this device and have yet to do anything but scuff the corner. I have kept it in an otter box 80% of the time, but it has still been extreemly trusty like all other Moto phones. All in all Motorola is a fantastic brand of phone.

I can't tell if its Verizon bloatware or Motorola's ""skin"" over top of Android, but the wi-fi randomly drops signal, sometimes constantly. Now, after three weeks of use, some program is running the battery down during phone idle. I think it is one of Motorola's programs, but it's annoying to put your phone down at 95% battery and then pick it up an hour later and your at 60% battery and your phone is burning hot. Also, a general comment on Android 4.1, i'm not a fan, there are not enough detailed options to control your phone and choose settings, only general setting are available. I might have to root it... Update - Still using an absurd amount of battery life while idle. I have screen on lowest setting, wi-fi off, make only a few calls,texts, or emails, surf the web for less than 10 min, and it uses 25% of battery life in less than three hours. Every day.

9719,B01LEL8ABY,SF Danner,5,27-Jul-17,True,Slick! Add a huge SD card with the savings you get buying at this price point.,"Best.Moto.phone.yet! If the luscious detail and color pop of the display doesn't grab you, the speed of operation may well do the trick! For example: this thing flies through updates. As an indicator; a 22M update for Google Docs will take approximately four to six seconds to perform. On the Moto X2 I upgraded from, the same install process for that single update would have lasted well over 20 seconds. To me this is a huge step forward in processing power. It takes AT&T LTE longer to download the updates than it takes the Moto Z to install them. The fingerprint detection is fantastic, once you go through the set up process. I chose to bind the phone's detection system with a finger from each of my hands, which is very helpful. The reader is really nimble, virtually instant, and the reader square is easy to find with one's fingertip in the dark. Like I said, the fingerprint reader is super responsive; more so than my recent vintage laptop's fingerprint reader. I think the verbal interface is beginning to shine, and gets most of my speech right. Commands spoken to the phone, initiated by a key phrase (default is ""Google Now"" to 'wake up' its ears, Example: ""Google Now set timer 8 minutes"". The phone will reply: ""okay, starting timer 8 minutes."" I think the default wake-up is cheesy. I changed my wake-up phrase to something uniquely my own. For adventures in the power of this phone's features, run an Internet search for ""15 first things every Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid owner should do"" and read through what phandroid put together. The tenth point: 'Activate Google’s secret menu and speed up your device' is one such gem. I would have never come across it otherwise. Speaking of update downloads. This is about when I first brought up the phone (after I took it to AT&T store to get the sim changed. Note: while I had the sim tray open I added the SanDisk Extreme 128GB microSDXC card I brought along from another Amazon purchase I made when ordering the phone. 192GB of storage with a fast quad core CPU - yes!! I reconfigured the camera app to use this storage instead of the phone's onboard.) The nitty gritty of first set up: there was a verrry long, drawn out series of mammoth updates to the initial build of the phone as shipped. First the screen prompted me to okay a system upgrade to version 7. (Android Nougat). Sure; why not. 1.5GB of download and one or more reboots later... then several rounds of Motorola's updates, totaling over 200M... and more reboots. Then Google joined the party to announce it had ANOTHER 250MB+ of updates, for apps. Well, better to have all this done up front than sometime later. I should add that you will also need a Wi-Fi connection for the phone during this procedure - because some of these updates won't run over the carrier, and the phone will tell you when you must connect to Wi-Fi in order to continue. Come to think of it, after all this updating I began to get a battery low indicator even though I had it connected to the charger. I found that by unplugging the cord and turning it over (USB-C is a symmetrically shaped plug) the phone suddenly woke up to 'charger connected'. Call me superstitious, but I put a sharpie marker dot on the top side of the plug so I would always plug it in that way, if it was a problem? Maybe I didn't have it pushed all the way in tight. That's just as possible. The metal plug should completely disappear into the phone port or it isn't securely connected. The charger I received with this Moto Z is considerably different than the charger that came with the Moto X2. For one, its now ""turbo"" (15-watt) which speeds up charging to three times faster than the Moto X. You can get a 40% charge in 25 minutes, or from 0-100% in about 80 minutes. The AC plug end of the charging cable is now quite large (2""H x 1.75""W x .875""D) and it is permanently attached to the cord. That means if you want/need a way to cable-connect your Moto Z to another computer you will need to purchase a separate cable: a USB type A to type C male-male. There's only one quirk (con?) I can think to point out about this phone. Perhaps it's related to or has something to do with the security posture? Security I enabled by activating its fingerprint reader, which also prompted me to establish an access pattern from an array of dots arranged on the screen like a touchtone phone key pad. (In fact, those dots ARE numbers on a touchtone key pad. Memorize what the number string associated with your saved access pattern equates to. I have read that there are certain instances where people have found themselves stranded facing a password prompt they didn't know they had input. However, they did - as a pattern! which is numerical under the hood.) Anyway, to the point of my gripe: when I power on the phone after shut down, it boots up with a spiel of graphics, then screen prompts me for the access pattern I set the phone to, and then it boots all over again! Some research indicates that this is because the first time is to access Android and the 2nd time is to access the desktop. However, it seems to me this process could be streamlined not to look like two complete boot ups. I have gotten over the much-lamented lack of a 3.5mm audio plug - for which the phone comes packaged with an 5"" long adapter/dongle which converts the phone's type C USB port into a 3.5mm stereo audio jack for wired headphones or speakers.",3.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

14909,B074VFRKZG,Dude w/Van,5,27-Jan-19,True,Nice upgrade from a Moto X2,"Upon receiving it and before installing a SIM I took the time to install all the updates and upgrade to Pie. The process took several hours and was easily accomplished in an evening while watching TV. Doing this first prevents having any complications that some reported after a Pie upgrade on a phone with third-party apps installed. I'm not all that big on using the Google Play apps for Syncing data to Google's cloud storage. I'm perfectly capable of saving my data locally on a computer. I prefer to avoid providing data about my life for Google to resell in the form of demographic information. That said, I love how the later versions of Android OS let me fine tune the apps to allow more privacy, and more battery life as well. I'll use about 33% of battery a day with my use scenario, which is light use, now that I've restricted Google Play Services permissions from gathering constant data about my activities and selections all the time. Google Play Services will nag incessantly with an error popup, but I just smile, clear it and keep looking for a method to disable these notifications from Google about their displeasure of being unable to data-mine me. ha ha The fingerprint reader is fabulous, and works much better than the one on a Lenovo laptop I have. The added functionality that eliminates the Back, Recent, and Home buttons from the display is handy too. The phone is beautiful and a bit slippery, so I ordered a case with the phone after reading reviews about this. There are many to choose from and I picked one that is low-profile to make it easier to slip into a pant's pocket. It meeting the IP68 standard for water resistance is beneficial for me as an outdoorsy type. Getting caught in a shower, or an errant spray from the hose won't be an issue. All the Moto features make up for my crippling Google Play Services as I can still use voice commands to open apps and other basic functionality built into the phone that don't require sharing every moment of my life with Google. I haven't used the Alexa app, and am unlikely to do so, but it is there should I change my mind. As a whole this is a perfect phone for me, with a lot of upgraded features and functionality over the Moto X2 it replaced. The fact that it can be had for under $200 (including the accessory case) makes it a fantastic value.",26.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X4 Factory Unlocked Phone - 32GB - 5.2"" - Super Black - PA8S0006US",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B074VFRKZG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159JihtggL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074VFRKZG,184,261.84,0.0

5279,B00OZTSY6Y,a long way from home,5,27-Jan-15,False,"Brains, Brawn and Beauty.... what more can you ask for in a phone.","this is without a doubt a great phone. I was upgrading from the droid razr maxx hd and ordered this from Amazon way back when but it wasn't in stock. I waited and waited and waited and finally, with my old phone misbehaving and taking forever to complete the simplest tasks, I couldn't wait any longer so I unfortunately had to purchase it from verizon. I far far far prefer getting my cell phones from Amazon... they have a much more lenient exchange policy. I just trust them to do the right thing. Not always the case with certain verizon stores. And, though the following statement has nothing to do with this phone and really needn't be in this review, I just have to say that when I purchased this phone from a local verizon kiosk I had the single worst cell phone buying experience ever. Too Bad. Now on to the positives about the phone.... - this thing is very responsive. You touch an app and it opens. It doesn't take its sweet time thinking about whether or not it wants to open. Everything is snappy. - flick your wrist twice to start the camera.... this is brilliant. Now when you see a photo you want to take you don't have to fumble for the camera app. Just flick your phone twice and the camera is on. Kind of like dorothy clicking her heals to get back home - Battery life. Maybe, just maybe it doesn't get a full 48 hours on one charge, but this thing IS a monster. It goes on and on and on and on and on. Really impressive battery life - quick charge.... using the rapid charger really does make a difference and is IS rapid - wireless charging capability. You've got to love being able to induction charge your phone. When I am at work I just lay it on the QI charger and don't think about it - beautiful. this shouldn't matter, but somehow it does. This thing in red is just spectacular - easy user interface. - moto voice commands work incredibly well. I was startled the first time I was in the car alone and a voice boomed out telling me I had a text and moto voice was asking if I wanted it to be read to me. Then it asked me if I wanted to respond to my texter. And it got everything right. Much more advanced voice recognition than my last phone. I had a ten minute texting dialog with a friend while driving and never once did I remove the phone from my pocket. I never looked at it at all. I am very anti texting and driving so the ability to do it without touching the phone is pretty amazing to me. - the screen is gorgeous. Photos and videos just pop. I was afraid I would find this too large to hold but it's okay. It is pretty much the outer limit of the size I want my phone to be but it is manageable with one hand most of the time. And now for my quibbles.... - no micro sd card slot - the stock email app does not have a ""select all"" option in order to batch delete older emails. You can't even batch delete from the trash. I installed a third party email app (Blue Mail, which is fantastic) - as far as I can tell, the camera does not have an exposure compensation setting. I hate using flash but I will have to if they don't do a software update for this. - as of this the writing of this review I am not sure they have done a software update so that you can use voice and data at the same time. When I am on the phone and try to schedule an appointment, I always receive the message that data isn't available while on the phone. I thought they were supposed to have this fixed by the end of 2014? This is fairly basic technology these days. Despite a few minor enough quibbles this phone is an absolute pleasure. I am sure when I am nearing the end of my contract in a couple of years I will find it maddening. For now I would go out on a limb and say it is one of the best phones on the market today, if not THE best. But that's just my humble opinion. You may disagree.

Reviews said the G6 Play didn't have the crisp screen like the G6, but I can't tell a difference. It's very crisp. The only issue I had was that I had trouble connecting to LTE when I first got it, which seems to be a common problem. I did a factory reset and that solved the problem, but it was after I had already downloaded all the apps and set up my accounts, so that was a pain to do twice. If you make sure it connects to LTE right away, you shouldn't have issues. The speaker is not as loud as other phones I have had, but it does its job. I love how much space it has and that I don't have to delete apps to make room for others. The screen lights up briefly any time any movement or vibration is sensed, which is great if I happen to glance at it when the time is lit up. It's hypersensitive that way, so I wonder if it affects my battery. Speaking of battery, I use this pretty often and only have to charge every 48 hours or so.

If you wait for promos, you can get this at (or under) $200. Some nuances I'd like to point out, which are very specific for my case coming from the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3, and thus are not mentioned on many reviews: 1. I really appreciated Alcatel's additional SMS handling options, specifically the ""Mark as unread"" feature. I had assumed this was an Android feature. But, it doesn't look like Oreo, or Motorola g6, has it. 2. Similarly, I liked Alcatel's ""Pin to top"" feature for certain contacts, when inside my messages list. I can't find this feature with the G6. 3. I wish that the flashlight could be a toggle-able feature that did not require enabling the Moto gestures. If there were simply a button I could press (rather than have to do the chop), I'd rather do that. 4. Probably the biggest one of all: Apparently, the front tiny LED cannot be used to indicate when a message/email/notification has arrived!

1278,B0096QYH80,thsp,5,27-Dec-12,False,1 Week so far so good,"A week ago, I switched a white Samsung Galaxy III for the white Razr M when TMobile let us out of our contract. Don't get me wrong, the SIII is a great phone but it was just too big for me. The M is the perfect size for me. The 1 thing I do not like about the M is the location of the power button....so far I haven't actually turned off the phone when I was on a call but what I usually do is turn up the volume when I mean to put the phone to sleep...just a bit of a pain but I am getting used to it and am sure the phone will have me trained within another week. Whoops...I guess there is 1 more thing I don't like but it's a Verizon thing...the phone comes with a lot of bloatware...not the phone's fault but I wish Verizon would let me uninstall the ones that are useless to me and save memory. What I like about this phone: the Circles Widget, love the look and the simple usefulness of it. It did not work the first day so I removed it from the home screen and installed other temp/time widgets but never found one I liked the look of...tried Circles again on the 2nd day and since then it has worked perfectly. Voice Texting, so far works great! Way better than the SIII's. Buttons, I like the location of the buttons and ease of use. Smart Actions, love this app! I programmed it to only ring in the middle of the night if it's someone important. Text reminders from my calendar will not wake me up at 5am any more. Plus there are all sorts of cool things SmartActions can do. WiFi, works great...that may be a Verizon thing too as wifi with Tmobile was within 20 feet of the router & was almost useless.

I have not watched a movie or tv episode yet. Call quality has been fine...no dropped calls...give props to Verizon for that.

22521,B07N91S9MW,Amazon Customer,2,27-Aug-19,True,"Seems like a good phone, but it's impossible to root","I specifically avoided the Amazon Alexa version of this phone because I knew that would mean a locked bootloader without any way around it. Upon getting it and going through the unlock process I found out from Motorola that even the non-Amazon version of the phone can't be unlocked if it comes from Amazon. On top of that, the price dropped by $40 less than a week after I bought it and Amazon won't match it unless I return this phone and re-purchase it at the lower price. The phone seems fine other than being locked. I suppose it's my fault for assuming that because ""unlocked"" means that no carriers have messed with it, I should be able to root the thing.

I also love the Motorola gestures and the pretty blue color. The battery holds up pretty good on a full charge (one QUICK full charge a day -- tho a gamer I am not). I have not dropped it (yet).

5233,B00OZTSY6Y,P. Michel,1,26-Oct-16,True,Motorola -- shame on you for deprecating phone through forced software update!,"This WAS a great phone -- right up until Motorola pushed a forced system update that completely disabled the phone's ability to both talk on the phone and use the Internet simultaneously. I went to Verizon Wireless store to get it fixed and they said it was irreversible on their end, and that the update was rolled out by Motorola. They knew exactly what happened, acknowledged that it wasn't cool, and I've been stuck with a phone that I can't talk + surf or use apps at the same time ever since. That was about 5-6 months ago. I can't even use my Waze GPS app while talking on the phone anymore! Nor can I send or receive texts if I'm on the phone. This is ridiculous. Motorola should be sued for making these original DROID Turbo's defunct to force you to buy a DROID 2 with no apparent way to reverse the update. I was 100% happy with this phone until Motorola forced this update. Well, to heck with them. I'm not buying another Motorola product ever again as I can't trust that they won't do something like this to a future phone to ruin a major portion of its functionality to force me to upgrade again. Mind you, I'm on a Verizon Wireless prepaid plan. This may play a role in this, but it shouldn't. I pay $45 per month for unlimited talk and text and should have every ability to use my phone just like contracted VZW customers. Anyway, shame on you Motorola.

I got it when it said that it was going to be back in stock at a later sate bbut then the shipping was bumped up to the same week so don't be afraid of the in stock later date. The phone is amazing. Depending on your internet speed, it will take a while for the four updates to take places; it goes from Kitkat, to the latest Lollipop and Marshmallow is expected soon. Apart from that, everything is great from the screen (super bright and vibrant) to the performance (which is impeccable for the price - I got 44000 on Antutu after downloading some apps. It got 30 - 50 FPS in the game region which is great. The phone is just really fast and can compete with the big flagship phones) to the gameplay (which is very fluid with no lag issues on arcade games, haven't tried frame intensive games) to the camera (absolutely amazing especially in apps like Instagram and Snapchat) to the microphones (I could talk to it from a good few feet away in the ideal conditions). The only thing is no SD card slot but everything else is great. Not to mention the cool Moto features and NFC support. 3 days update The phone is still holding beautifully. It better than ever with around 5GB left in storage (after downloading a lot of games and social media apps). Just monitor your storage so you don't use it up all at once. But as it is, the phone is functioning beautifully and it working like a charm. It still doesn't lag and functions beautifully and the more graphic intensive games like FIFA 15 and easily handles games like Crossy Road with ease. Day to day tasks are even smoother with no stuttering, just fluid actions from opening apps to using them for long periods of time to jumping from one to another; the RAM is holding up spectacularly. I would highly recommend getting a quick charger with it so you can keep it charged. You'll need it if you use your phone alot. All the Moto Actions still work and as time passes, the phone gets to know you better so it appears to work better over time (just make sure all the apps are up to date). Just a really great phone overall.

22826,B07NPRQYP1,Yuleika,4,26-May-19,True,Automatic screen light changes and the phone is made in China,"My experience with this phone is that the delivery was made on time, when I started reading the manual I noticed something curious and it is that the manual is in Spanish which is perfect for me because my native language is Spanish, reading the manual at the end I could read that this phone was made in China and the charger says the same. When I started using it, I was worried because the battery did not last long, and the light on the screen changed constantly and bothered me. After investigating a little more about this phone I could realize that the battery does not last long because of the inactivity mode image that makes the phone screen turn on in constant periods of time, which I managed to deactivate in phone configuration. On the other hand the change of lights that the phone's screen has while you use it is due to a sensor that has to make the light of the phone's screen adjust automatically, it can be deactivated in the Motorola application that brings it installed on the telephone. To finish I want to say that the phone works perfectly, it is fast, the service I am using is T-Mobile, the quality of the camera is good for the price.

3330,B00HPP3QD6,Aaron P.,3,26-May-15,True,"Amazing in every way, but missing something extremely important to most people.","I would love to give this phone 5 stars. Excellent speed, quad core processor, it's got a GPU in it, not much of one but hey, for the price of the phone, it's good. I really don't have a complaint about this phone other than one thing. And it's a pretty big thing, enough to warrant 3 stars when I want to give it 5. There is no SD slot, and it doesn't say there isn't one. It's 2015, SD card is pretty much standard, I mean crap, my DROID X that came out in 2010 has an SD card slot, my stupid non-smart-prepaid phone has an SD card slot and yet this doesn't? Now many people would see this as not a big deal since it has 8 GB of internal memory. Those people fail to understand that's the TRUE memory, take away the room for the operating system and updating the apps that CANNOT be removed unless you root your phone, and you're down to about 5 GB of room. And even still, people would say that that's still a lot of room, which in reality, depends on your needs/wants. You like to take a lot of photos? That memory is going to go down fast. Like to download a lot of good quality (Hearthstone, Cytus, Plants vs. Zombies, etc) that's going to go down even faster. Like to have a lot of music? 4 albums is an average of 350 MB depending on the quality (more compression = worse quality). And I have a good 6 GB of music on my SD card as is. And I like to take photos, listen to music and download apps, but I can't really do too much of that without an SD card. It really sucks because I love everything about this phone but the lack of SD card slot (which I will say after investigating, there is a spot for it, they were going to add it but saved it for the second gen of it which is just a way of getting more people to spend their money on it, which sounds like an Apple move to me) is a big thing to not have, TL;DR. Amazing phone, no SD card slot, can't do too much extra stuff (apps, music, photos) without an SD card.",1.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

5351,B00OZTSY6Y,Colin G.,4,26-Mar-15,False,I'd like to give the community some insight in return for ...,"I've had the Droid Turbo for a little over two weeks now, and while I didn't purchase it through Amazon, I'd like to give the community some insight in return for all of their assistance. My usage ranges from light to moderate and includes fairly heavy texting, several phone calls, browsing the web, utilizing Google Maps on occasion, banking applications and somewhat heavy use in the app iFunny. DISPLAY The colors are fantastic, and don't appear washed out or over-saturated. Pictures are sharp and crisp looking. Touch reception is accurate and consistent, despite my screen protector. Outside viewing is acceptable as well as viewing angles. The screen itself can get plenty bright, but doesn't dim very well; even on its lowest setting, it still casts quite a glow and can be annoying at times in complete darkness. I recommend keeping the display on 'auto', then fine tuning to your specific needs as the day progresses. Overall though, that is very minor and I have otherwise been very impressed. 5/5 DESIGN The uni-body design gives this phone a very premium and sturdy feel. It's heavier than most smartphones, but I find pleasure in that rather than distaste. Makes me feel like I'm holding something actually worth the money I put into it. I have extremely small hands for a man, so I do wish it was slightly smaller, but have managed to utilize this device one handed fairly easily. It's a little awkward at times but manageable. The touch buttons are logical and placed well within reach of my thumb. The fact that they are capacitive as opposed to resistive will be a matter of preference; I for one enjoy the buttons as they are. The glass fiber backing is pretty slick, but solid and can take a small beating without a case (speaking from experience). The volume and lock toggles, while textured, are still not very pronounced, especially the volume one. I find myself tapping it several times before I get it to do what I want, but I feel that it will become second nature the more I use the phone. Satisfied overall. 4/5 BATTERY Because my usage is probably lighter than most users my age, my ability to get two days of use easily out this phone should be regarded carefully. I've been charging every other day now for about fifteen days, and I've always had between twenty and thirty percent left. I could probably squeeze another half day or so out of it, but am perfectly satisfied with its performance. I'd wager even under heavy use, a day shouldn't be difficult to achieve. My one complaint is that it is non-removable. No matter how good a battery is, even one such as this, eventually it won't be able to hold a charge at all and an entire new phone is going to be needed. Had to dock a point for that, since I'd much rather swap out a battery then an entire phone, even if I'm sacrificing longevity to do so. But that is a matter of opinion. Get a smart charger for maximizing the battery's life, and avoid overcharging as best you can, since that is the number one killer of Lithium Ion. 4/5 PERFORMANCE Snappy and responsive, plain and simple. Haven't had so much as a hiccup on anything. At idle, CPU averages 3% with 1.5GB of RAM free for use after all my needed apps are installed and running. But I do not game on my phone, nor do I plan to, so except for some intensive banking, I'm not really stressing any of the chips. Why'd I get such a fast quad-core with 3GB of RAM then? I like to think ahead, and if I plan to do something CPU/RAM intense, I like the fact that my phone will be able to stand up to the plate. I want my phone to meet my current needs and any plausible futuristic ones I may have. 5/5 INTERFACE/SOFTWARE The Droid UI is one I am familiar with, having had the Droid Mini a couple years previous. I like the Droid approach to Android, it doesn't have a lot of the 'prettiness' that other interfaces seem to have, such as LG or Samsung. The look and feel is straightforward, plain and practical. And that's what I like; if you prefer a more gussied up look, the Droid interface probably isn't for you. I'd recommend playing with it first before buying. Being a Verizon phone, the typical bloatware is included, but can be easily disabled and removed completely if needed (some phones let you disable but not uninstall; Droid allows both for several apps). Customization is as expected when it comes to any Android phone. I only use one home screen, as my OCD kicks in if I have more than one, and I'm glad Droid allows to me to get rid of the others. 5/5 STORAGE 32GB is plenty for my current needs, however I do wish there was an option for expandable memory. It's 2015, that should be a default option for smartphones nowadays. And while I don't plan on using more than 32GB (~23GB available to user), it would still be nice to have that option. Yes there is cloud storage, but I'm a lil old fashioned and prefer my storage as physical as possible when I can. 3/5 CAMERA It's a phone that takes pictures, that's all I'd ever want out of a camera that's attached to phone. Pictures come out very sharp and clear as does video. That's really all I can say about it; I take pictures of my cat and the occasional family photo, nothing really groundbreaking that would require professional looks, so this fits my need perfectly. The video is also extremely sharp and audio has come out at a respectable volume and clarity. 5/5 CONNECTIVITY Wi-Fi has been stable, strong and consistent. No trouble connecting to other routers. Call quality is acceptable, with me sounding exceptionally clear while others can sometimes be muffled, though I am told this is mainly attributed to Advanced Calling 1.0, which is still pretty buggy since its release. I usually have 3+ bars being in a fairly big city, so overall the experience has been positive. Speaker is a decent volume and clarity. Volume during calls is somewhat low, even when maxed out. I suspect a software patch could be a fix. 4/5 AUDIO Most fault the Turbo for terrible quality, yet I find it very acceptable. It's a phone and not meant for awesome sound so why expect it? That said, I've played Pandora through the speakers and even over the sound of my shower it sounds great. It's clear and even has some thump to it. Granted, it's no where near something like the M8, but for what it is I say it's darn great. Can get a little distorted when on full blast though, but that is minor in my eyes since I don't usually use my phone for music. 5/5 TL;DR The phone is a beast, able to get me through two days easily with light to moderate usage. Phone does get hot with heavy use, however I've been told this is normal and in retrospect, it does cool down quite fast. It's a decent size phone, probably not for really tiny hands but still manageable. Love the feel of it and the Droid UI. Recommend some kind of wrap or slim case for grippage. Really wish the battery was removable and it had the option for additional storage, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I would recommend as long as one is familiar with the Droid UI and has experience in their previous lineup, since it can be a little frustrating fresh-off-the-boat with other brands like LG or Samsung.",8.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

1362,B0096QYH80,damc34,4,26-Mar-13,False,Great phone...if you can ignore app storage space issue,"Bought this phone for my wife this weekend. Our first smart phone and overall we love it. PROS: -Good battery life (especially compared to the Samsung feature phone she had the past 1+yr) -Running Android 4.1 -Speedy at doing everything (apps open up faster than on my nexus 7 tablet) -Great screen = dims enough to use at night and not annoy anyone and very bright during sunny day CONS: -Only 4+GB of available internal storage space -no micro HDMI port -Can't move apps off internal storage to micro SD card!! Some people have complained about the battery life, and yes the battery life sucks if you are a heavy smart phone user... but I have yet to hear from my heavy phone users that their smart phone last more than 24+ hrs after heavy use. We have only had the phone 5 days and have charged it twice. The first charge came after a day and a half because I was installing all my apps and updating others that came pre installed on the phone. I just charged it last night after almost 3 days. Again not amazing battery life but I have yet to hear of any smart phone that last longer than 24 hrs from heavy use. Motorola made some changes to Jelly Bean and that is where my biggest CON for this phone comes from. Motorola, in its infinite wisdom, to prevent rooters from rooting the Razr M, eliminated the option to move apps to micro SD card. 4 gigs is not enough space for apps if you like a tons of apps and you like trying new ones without having to worry about deleting others to make room. Basically, you HAVE to buy a micro SD card for this phone. Period. I have a 32GB card in the phone and I should be able to get my photos, music, and videos on the card and use the internal space solely for apps. I stream most of my big files from 3 cloud services but I like the convenience of having my files on my devices if possible. If I had paid $100 for this phone, instead of $0, I would be even more annoyed by the storage issues.

I'm a heavy user so for a phone to last one day is probably like three for most people. A negative for me is that it only comes with 32 GB memory. Mine filled up in the first two weeks and I've purchased an SD card. This is the only phone I have HAD to purchase an SD card for. It's not enough standard memory.

22244,B07MN8QTK1,Rev. Dr. James,1,26-Jun-19,True,"I""ll Never Buy Motorola Products Again","Some years back I bought two Motorola Charm phones and both of them developed problems with the screens that cost more to fix than the out-of-guarantee phones were worth. So, I bought two Motorola G7 Play phones and just a month after using them, one developed an interesting problem: It became impossible to access the ""Settings"" button, which, of course, means no access to internet or any apps. Then the flashlight and other built-in features worked. Checked the Motorola forums and found there wasn't much there except other people with the same problem. Their smart phones were no longer smart. Since the time to return the phone to Amazon had passed, I contacted Motorola for warranty care. After multiple emails with apparently computer-generated responses, all of which denied me service of any kind, unless they had further information. After complying with all information requests the reply from Motorola is that, ""your phone does not qualify for in-warranty support for the following reason: The retailer of the device is Amazon sold by: Wireless Experts, Inc which is not one of the authorized retailers of Motorola."" So, no sservice from Motorola. I never expected this absolutely impersonal, unhelpful reply from Motorola.

15664,B075SKYZXY,Mike Whitmer,2,26-Jul-19,False,"Good Start, but over time it got worse.","Purchased a Motorola Z2 Force a little over a year ago. While I thought the features (mods, etc.) were pretty cool, I was only looking for an inexpensive smartphone that would let me do my work. At first, it seemed like a pretty good buy, but with time the true nature of the phone emerged. In just a few short weeks, layers of the display began to separate from the glass of the phone. The ""unbreakable"" part (plastic) started to lift off the phone, down near the fingerprint button. Eventually, the plastic began to lift even more and the only thing that made it usable was the screen protector I put on it. But I figured I could 'weather' that problem and kept using it. Just a few weeks ago, I was on a long trip and pulled the phone out of my pocket. To my surprise, it was totally dead. At first I thought it might be out of power, but when I plugged it in, nothing happened (no lights, no buzz, nothing). I tried several other things (there's no way to get inside to try resetting anything) but with no results. I finally determined that the phone was ""bricked"" and began to look for a replacement. But two days after the mishap, I randomly plugged it in to power and this time it started to recharge. I was relieved and hoped it was a one-time glitch. Sadly, it was not!! It has now shutdown several times and will come back after a day or two of rest (maybe it is waiting for retirement like me). I am limping along, right now, hoping to get the phone to give me a few more weeks while I save for another unit (not Motorola). I have spent some time looking at sites discussing this phone and have discovered my issues are not unusual. It seems that a large number of users are having the same (and other) issues. It is sad to see a company that used to have such a good reputation begin to lose their way. I'm very disappointed with the quality of construction of this phone. Motorola used to be a pretty good company, but it seems they have digressed. P.S. My wife has the same phone and, so far, she is only experiencing the ""separation"" on the screen.

3440,B00HPP3QD6,Joshmo,5,26-Jul-14,False,Great Nexus 4 Replacement,"I bought this locally (Amazon was out of stock) about a week ago to replace a mostly dead Nexus 4. The Nexus had one problem after another. the last being a screen that went out. I was looking for something to tide me over until a new phone came out that I like. I didn't want to spend too much, and when I saw this I decided it was worth considering switching to Verizon. When I got the phone, I was impressed with the build quality, and as I checked out more features, I ended up liking it better than the N4. It may lack a few of the N4 features, but none that I care about. Prior to the screen issue with the N4, my biggest gripe was battery life. It seemed that every 7-8 hours (on standby), the battery would need to be recharged, and it would take anywhere from 3-5 hours to charge it. Right now, with moderate data usage, the battery on the Moto G is at 29.5 hours and still has 27% battery life left. I got it for $59, so I am thrilled to have a phone I consider to be on par with, or better than, the N4 for almost $300 less. By the way, I upgraded to KitKat 4.4.4 with no issues. The data plan at Verizon is pretty lame compared to my unlimited data at Straight Talk, but I spend most of my time connected to wifi, so it's not a huge deal. Plus I can buy a block of bridge data if needed, which I might at some point, since I just discovered I am able to use tethering on the Moto G. This is looking like it may be the phone I use for a couple of years, instead of as a ""gap phone"" (assuming I like Verizon's service). More storage would be great, but since I rarely used most of the apps on my N4, I doubt I will run out of room. I can add and remove apps as I need them. I added just enough music to get me through my train commute, and with the apps I have installed, I still have 3GB left. If I need more music, I can use my iPod. I have yet to find anything I don't like about this phone. I even like that it's a tad smaller than the N4.",1.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

20873,B07HFKWDK7,Shaed,3,26-Jan-19,False,Eh for the price.,"First, to start this off, this phone is NOT CDMA compatible. That means it will not work with Verizon or US Cellular. It will only work with TMobile or AT&T, or a carrier that goes through one of them, such as Cricket. The phone itself might be metal, and while the back of it looks really nice and solid, the phone is actually extremely light. The front looks cheap, and the fingerprint sensor sticks up enough above the glass that if you run your fingernail across the screen it will catch on the sensor. As far as performance, I have no complaints. The phone is extremely fast. When it comes out of the box, it will be installed with Android version 7.1.0. There is about 4 hours worth of updates to install, but the phone does eventually install Android version 8.1.0. The phone seems to handle games just fine, and there is no lag when loading apps like some cheaper phones. The phone performs better than my previous phone which was a Motorola E4 Plus. The E4 wins in every single category except performance. It looked better and felt better to hold. If you don't use your phone too much, and just need something for checking Instagram and Snapchat occasionally etc, I would recommend getting the E4 plus. It's battery life is almost double that of the G5s. If you want a phone more for gaming, but don't really have the money for something expensive, then get the G5s plus.

5359,B00OZTSY6Y,L. M Young,5,26-Jan-15,False,Glad I Didn't Get the Galaxy 5!,"I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for ""free"" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention. But I've never been ""in love"" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said.

14649,B072ZWCKP5,Michael,2,26-Feb-18,True,Don't purchase this phone!!!,"Where to begin with what don't like about this phone that I wish I had never purchased. First off, internet is slow, reminds me of the old dial-up days and it doesn't matter whether or not you are on wi-fi or cellular service. Can take minutes for a page to load and sometimes pages just simply won't load at all. Have tried Chrome and Mozilla Firefox with similar results. Secondly, it is virtually impossible to have a phone call without ""cheek dialing"" someone else while on your current call. For example, a week or so ago I was trying to talk to my parents but during a 15 minute phone call I accidentally cheek dialed someone else three different times and had to hang up on them and then re-dial my parents. The slightest movement will cause the screen to light up and then your cheek or ear will push some button. Has happened on almost every single phone call I've made with this frustrating phone. Next is the horrible camera, the main reason I decided to ""upgrade"" from my old dumb phone was for the much better camera. Well that was a mistake as it is very difficult to take a picture that isn't blurry. (Have researched online and found this is a common issue with this phone.) Another extremely frustrating issue with this phone is the fact that you apparently cannot download your own music to this phone and then be able to play it or use it as ringtones. The music files do show up on your device storage but after hours of researching and messing with it I have given up on being able to play music with this phone. My old $50 dumb phone could play music files that I transferred from my computer but not this $200 ""smart phone"". The fingerprint scanner is another issue, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. About the only reason for not giving this phone a one star rating is the battery, it does have a battery that seems to last longer than most any cell phone I have used. In closing, I cannot think of one reason you should spend your hard-earned money on this phone. If you do, don't say you weren't warned.",1.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

3545,B00HPP3QD6,Interrogative,2,26-Feb-14,True,Significant operational issues within first 24 hours of use,"First, I would like to start off by saying that this phone is wonderful for the price you pay ($99 USD). It's got a great, affordable 4x core processor that makes the phone feel like you paid way more than a C-Note for. Apps run very well on this phone and call quality is outstanding! That's about where the shininess ends. Over the past 24 hours I've not been able to stay connected to WiFi. This is a significant issue for those of us with limited data plans. I cannot stay connected to an access point for more than an hour without me having to clear the device's association with any WiFi access points I connect to. I've searched the Moto Forums, Internet forums and Android OS specific forums for troubleshooting and none of these resources have yielded any productive results. The most prescribed method of resolving this issue is to do what I've just mentioned: ""Forget"" wireless network association, reboot phone, re-associate device with access point. I've done everything conceivable from a technical standpoint and have submitted a ticket for support with Motorola regarding this issue. I would have given this device 4 out of 5 stars for it's affordability, usability and screen resolution, but this WiFi issue is killing my appreciation of the device.",6.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0
1319,B0096QYH80,Spinnwisconsin,1,26-Feb-13,False,Good until Major Problems,"This phone started off good but once you find out that Apps can only be stored on the internal 4GB storage you quickly realize this device is a huge mistake. Forget the 32GB SD card, it is very difficult to move photos, music, onto it and impossible to move apps. The 8GB internal storage is cut in half with bloatware. You will need to delete apps so you can add new ones, and you're stuck with crap like slacker radio, IMBD, and Verizon apps that are designed to eat data and increase your bill. I was very excited when I moved to my first 4G phone, but extremely frustrated and disappointed with it now. Verizon support will give you the wrong instructions and when you call back they suggest finding an app to move apps in Google play, but they won't recommend any specific app. And none of the apps (free or paid) will actually move apps to the SD card. Motorola support blames Verizon. And forget about using a secure e-mail client, the security certificate can not be placed on the SD card either. Maybe if this phone was rooted, it would be ok. I don't know, never tried that but unfortunately that might be the only option left unless Verizon recalls these ""broken"" devices. I had to drop this down to 1 star from 2, you will also need to download a volume app, as the volume button only controls 1 volume at a time, and you won't be able to tell which one. You can turn down the ringer, but the phone will not turn the notification to the same level, so you will be in an office and the ringer is on low and then a text or e-mail will come in at full volume, or you open a game and the game tone is still at full volume.

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up concerning two issues with this phone. 1- When I'm on a call via blue tooth, and another call comes in, when I ignore the call my current call goes silent, and i have to push speaker phone, then blue tooth to be able to hear the person I'm talking to again. The phone also gets a little glitchy when you answer an incoming call and try to switch back. 2- One morning after an incoming call my phone went blank, the dreaded black unresponsive screen,right before I'm leaving town, and I NEEDED the GPS and other features on my phone. Long story short, I took it to Verizon, and it turns out this is a common problem with this phone, and all you have to do is reboot it. So to save you a trip to the Verizon store- to reboot, hold down the volume down button and the power button for 10 seconds and you should be good to go.

But, it's an android - it's easy to figure out. So far, despite loving all metal phones - this is much better than the nokia 6.1 it replaced (fingers crossed) - even though specs are similar, this screen seems better, and the Dolby sound mixer is a decent feature. Now about it being ""unlocked"". It is. It's also the model not meant for North America. This may get in the way of things with your carrier, based on your location. For me, with MetroPCS - It wouldn't work without binding the new IMEI number to the SIM card, pretty normal for most carriers, but wait, it gets better! I had MMS and LTE calls after setting up the IMEI, sure... but no data.

13511,B0714DBSNH,Laura S.,5,26-Apr-18,True,This great pre-paid phone can be transferred to contract for a small fee.,"Very nice phone. Very similar to the MotoG5 I already own. I bought this phone as an upgrade to an old phone on our Verizon account. I had to activate this phone first on the pre-paid plan. This cost $30 dollars; the minimum plan amount. Once the phone was activated it could then moved to my contract plan by swapping sim cards. A Verizon rep had to do something in his system to allow the pre-paid IMEI number to be activated with my old SIM card. This is essentially a locked phone. The Verizon representatives were very willing and helpful doing this change. I called 611 to start the activation process; explained that I wanted to move the phone to my contract plan. They told I had to activate pre-paid phone and pay for one month service. After the phone was activated, the rep called me back to start the transfer process. I was then handed off someone on the contract side who unlocked the IMEI and associated it with my old SIM card. I inserted my old SIM card and now this new phone is on my account. This pre-paid phone is subsidized by Verizon. That is why it only $100 or so. They expect you use it as a prepaid phone for some time. So even though it cost me an extra $30, I have a new MOTO E4 Plus.",4.0,Motorola,Verizon Motorola Moto E4 Plus Carrier Locked Prepaid Phone,https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Motorola-Carrier-Locked-Prepaid/dp/B0714DBSNH,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fbn3oN4JL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0714DBSNH,28,129.99,0.0

5323,B00OZTSY6Y,Galka,4,26-Apr-15,True,"If price is no object, then almost the best phone ever","Summary: Nice phone, but why the ballistic nylon, why no SD card, why not totally waterproof, and why oh why so expensive? This is my 10th (or more) phone, having started with a big block of battery and electronics from the mid 90s. It's definitely the best so far, but I always feel dirty after spending many hundreds of dollars on a device that fits in my pocket and lasts just a couple of years. I upgraded from Droid MAXX, which still is a very nice phone. The biggest improvement over the MAXX for me is the camera. The Turbo doesn't feel much faster than the MAXX, and the battery is the same or even a little worse. You should get the wireless charger - it really saves money on USB cables and busted USB ports. - I really hate the fact that the Droids don't have expandable memory. 32GB is not enough on board storage, so I went with this one at 64GB, but then I'm forced to take the ballistic nylon back material. - Ballistic nylon comes unglued from the phone (but it's covered with the case, so it doesn't really matter). It's kind of a nice feel, but I'm never going to use a phone without at least a slim case, so I don't really care what the back looks or feels like. - At this price point, it should really be waterproof, like Samsung and Sony. - I know that this will be too slow in two years due to lack of long-term support from Google for Android - It's true, that pointy lower corner really does dig into your hand. With a case on, I can't feel it + Battery life = AWESOME, but I want MORE. I'd accept another 5mm thickness and 100g weight for more battery. If you ever used a battery like this or the MAXX, then you wonder how you ever got by with less than 24hrs of battery life. + Fast + Decent camera, or at least much better than Droid MAXX + Video is really VERY nice + NICE screen I docked a star for price, ballistic nylon, and lack of SD card",6.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

22601,B07N91S9MW,Gene,4,25-Sep-19,True,A really great phone for a competitive price,"The way I've been describing this phone is to say that if I took it back in time maybe 5 years, it would be the very best phone on the market, really amazing. In today's market, it's still a great phone but maybe doesn't quite match some of the high-end, $1000 phones. Which is fine with me. I've been using this phone for two weeks and am quite happy with it - great screen, fast processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage PLUS a slot for a micro-SD memory card. A fine set of specifications. The one big downside, sad to say, is that it's an Android phone! Yeah, I find Google's business model to be really insidious, almost perverse. But we all try to live with that and, shoot, I love some of their applications. So, for now, I'm using an Android phone and finding it very acceptable. Oh, the one downside - the body of this phone is, I guess, all glass, and it's as slippery as a bar of soap in the bathtub.

14998,B074XF6JCD,ultra55371d,1,25-Sep-18,False,"Loved it, now I HATE it!","I've had this phone for about 2 months now and I really liked it. Previous I had a Samsung S7 Edge but after 2 years the battery was awful and the screen burn was horrible. I liked the idea of adding mods and having a shatterproof screen were 2 of the main reasons I chose it. Also in the past, I really liked the Motorola products that I have had. Their quality was always a step above the others in my opinion. When I started using the phone, I found a bunch of great features that were not published on either the AT&T or Motorola websites. Some of these features were AptX, AptX HD, excellent graphic equalizer, text to speech while driving and the Bluetooth 5 was about 30% louder on all my peripherals and my car stereo. It was faster, thinner and even charged faster than my S7. The screen was also an improvement and I loved the Moto Gestures that are actually very useful. When I received the phone, it had Android 7 installed and everything worked great and at that time I was a proud owner of the Z2 Force Edition! I love my music and it really made my high end car stereo sound unbelievable, my S7 did not have AptX and it really made a huge difference in both how loud I could listen to my music and how great it sounded. My love of the phone only lasted 3 weeks however. After 3 weeks, the phone wanted to update to Android 8 and that's when the problems started. After the update, the phones Bluetooth would disconnect any time I tried playing a music app. Spotify is my main app that I like the most, but I also have Amazon Prime and Google Play. The phone would connect to the stereo and I could take and receive calls without any problems. Waze worked fine as well, but as soon as I opened any music app (even YouTube) the Bluetooth would disconnect. I went to Motorola's forums and saw a thread about the Android 8 Oreo update and many, many other customers were having the same issue. AT&T rolled out the Android 8 update much later than other providers so this has been a known issue happening for many months. After reading the many different comments others were having, me and many others believed that Android 8.1 fixed the issue. In fact, Android released the 8.1 version of their software less than 2 months after 8.0 was released because it was a known issue and they immediately provided a solution to all Android users. Common sense would say to roll out Android 8.1 for a simple fix, but it's now been 9 months now that 8.1 has been released and Motorola will not update the software for the Z2. At first they were blaming the car and stereo manufactures stating they needed to update their firmware. Then they started requesting customers to send them bug reports so they could identify the issue. I and many others have sent in bug reports (which is a very lengthy and difficult process) and nobody has received a response from Motorola stating they received the report. I have tried resetting my network settings and even did a full factory reset hoping my phone would revert to Android 7 but it was all a waste of time. AT&T even sent me a replacement phone because of the issue but the new phone already had Android 8 loaded on it so I just sent it back. Kudos to AT&T for at least trying to help me out and resolve the issue. Motorola / Lenovo prefers to blame the issues on others and they blatantly ignore the defect Android 8 has with thousands of their customers that own the Z2. Now today I looked at the new Z3 from Motorola on Amazon and guess what? It comes with Android 8.1 installed already. Why they won't update the Z2 is frustrating and makes me think a reputable company just doesn't care about their customers. I am sure they would have to pay a licensing fee or something similar to update to 8.1 and they would rather ignore the issue. I did read on the Android website that the Z2 is going to get the Android 9 update so maybe that's why they are not rolling out the 8.1 version. The question is, when will they release Android 9? Pixel users have it and from their comments, it's working great and there are no major issues. The most frustrating thing about this for me personally is that I purchased my phone through AT&T with a 20 month contract. The do have a return policy of 2 weeks and will take back any of the phones they offer if you are not happy with it. My phone was working great during the first 2 weeks, but in the 3rd week when the 8.0 update happened, I could no longer return the phone. I really feel that Motorola should honor their own warranty (which is longer than other companies) and give us the Z3 with 8.1 installed to resolve the issues that thousands of customers are now having with their Z2. In the least, they should offer us one of the available mods for the phone to compensate for the inconvenience. For over a month now, I have been using 2 phones whenever I leave the house. My wife's phone so I can listen to music, use Waze and make / receive calls while in the car and my Z2 which has all my family's events, schedules and reminders on it. My wife is also very unhappy with me taking her phone on a daily basis and it has standard Bluetooth 4 which does not sound nearly as good as 5 with AptX. Motorola was always known in the past to put out a great product and maybe this is due to Lenovo taking ownership of them. So my recommendation is not to buy this phone if you want to use it in your car at least until they release Android 8.1 or 9. At first I loved the phone and its capabilities, now I am just frustrated and upset that Motorola will not back their own products.",4.0,Motorola,Motorola Moto Z2 Force XT1789 64GB ATT only (Super Black),https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Force-XT1789-Super-Black/dp/B074XF6JCD,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b9BtbvjML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF6JCD,20,0.0,0.0

4554,B00MWI4KKE,Dwiggles,4,25-Sep-15,False,Great phone other than a couple exceptions,"General: The Moto X Gen 2 by Motorola is my first ever smart phone. Being in the IT field, it didn’t take me long to adapt to the OS and the basic functionality of the phone. I’ve owned the phone for about four months now. The design of the phone itself is very clean and has rounded edges. The back of the phone is rounded and has a hard plastic back that feels vaguely soft. A micro USB port is located at the bottom and a 3.5 mm headphone jack is located at the top. Overall, the phone’s build quality is best designed for use in a business environment and not a highly active one. Pros: I’ll now go over some pros of the phone. The touch screen size is perfect a perfect fit for a person’s hand. Its resolution is crystal clear, is very precise, and reasonably sensitive. Cell tower reception is superb, it has beaten my older basic phones everywhere I’ve taken it and checked the signal strength (though this may be due to my cell service company). There is a notification setting that shows the app that gave the notification. Swiping up allows you to go directly to the app. This is useful as you don’t have go to the unlock screen which would be bright during the night. Cons: There are, however, a few flaws I found with the phone. First off, not having a micro SD memory card slot is a major shortcoming for an Android phone. If I had wanted to use the phone for taking high quality videos, this would limit my recording time to shorter videos. The curvature on the back of the phone makes it difficult to use while laying on a flat surface. While this can be corrected with a case, it seems a little short sited by Motorola.

More precisely, when I am on the phone nobody can hear me on the other end unless I switch the phone to speaker mode. When I searched on the internet for a solution it seems this is a very common issue with no solution I was able to locate. I then called Motorola for assistance and they were terribly unhelpful. They offered to send me a used phone as a replacement for my new phone that didn't work. In my online search I read several people complained that they received a replacement phone and it had the same issue. After wasting many, many hours setting up the phone and troubleshooting a problem I didn't create I was left with no option but to return the phone to Amazon. Thank you Amazon! The best explanation I found on the internet was that the hardware on the phone is all working, it is the software for the Motorola phone feature that is the problem. This does make sense because the microphone does work just fine for all other uses. How can a company sell a 'smart phone' in which the PHONE doesn't work??

26372,B07WSJYDXX,M. Fawcett,5,25-Oct-18,False,"Winner, Winner!","First- I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS. But this phone, I have to. I think this phone deserves as many starts as it can get. On my old phone, I dealt with a cracked screen for months before I tried to fix it myself. ^-^ (Fail) Besides the screen, it had many other problems. I could never run multiple apps, and the phone would freeze everytime I ran Google maps and forgot I couldn't open another app. BUT, I'm so glad I failed at replacing the screen, otherwise I wouldn't have found this GEM. I bought it with the sole purpose of simply finding a phone with hotspot. ONLY thing I cared about. The box SAID nothing about it having fingerprint, which I was completely upset, but again, willing to sacrifice for the hotspot capability (live in boonies, NO fiber anywhere near me). That being said, being the boonies, and anywhere else you go, different carriers cover different areas. This phone has the capability to SWITCH BETWEEN NETWORK CARRIERS (Global, LTE/CDMA, or LTE/GSM,UMTS) at the press of a button. I've gone from NO SIGNAL, to FULL bars, by simply changing the network carrier. No restart needed! (I don't know if this option is common to phone nowadays, but my old phone was less than 2 years old and didn't have that capability). I love that the fingerprint scan is ON FRONT!!! Everything it has works LIKE IT SHOULD, even after 2 months. Nothing bogs it down. I can run MULTIPLE apps, and Maps gives me NO problems. It has shortcuts galore. I can set it to be unlocked in certain locations (which is probably common for most phones, but my old one had this function and IT NEVER worked). Screen size, Perfection. NOT HUGE, but also not small. Fits everywhere. My old one was too big to fit in my baby stroller, this perfect. One thing I set up, was flashlight handshake. I'm always needing to use the flashlight, and NOW all I do is hold my phone and act like I'm shaking someone's hand and it turns on and off!! LOVE IT!!

4478,B00MWI4HW0,A.I.,5,25-Oct-14,True,From Nexus 4 to the new Moto G (US GSM unlocked),"Ok, I switched from Nexus 4, a pretty good phone, so this review is also a comparison to Nexus 4: 1) screen size - not that much bigger than Nexus' 4.7, but the more I use it, the more I like it. 5 Inches is good for using the phone as a GPS/ watch movies and at the same time it still fits in the pocket. 2) resolution - the colors are vibrant, even though the resolution is not that great. I set it to ""Auto"" and it is good enough to see both in the evening and during daytime. 3) Micro SD card slot - is a beautiful thing, easy to reach on this phone, I bought a Samsung micro SD card here on Amazon, pretty inexpensive. 4) sound - using T-Mobile, I did notice that I have to set the call volume high, but I can still hear the other person clearly. Alarms/music/movies sound good. 5) Internet speeds - On T-Mobile, I mostly get H, and sometimes H+ and 3G, and pages load faster than on Nexus 4. 6) Camera - MUCH better than on Nexus 4, makes good shots even in low light conditions. Images can be a little fuzzy, but the colors are true. 7) Battery - also MUCH better than on Nexus 4, easily lasts a day with moderate/heavy use; takes 1.5 hours to get a full charge. 8) Build quality - very good, does not look/feel cheap. 9) the only thing I noticed is a tiny lag when returning to the home screen, about 1 second that it takes widgets/apps on the home screen to load. Bottom line - for the money, this is a very good unlocked phone and an excellent value. People even mistake it for a Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes, that's how good it looks! Update - December 21 Im still very much impressed with the phone, just wanted to add a couple of things I noticed: 1) It now takes a little longer to charge from 0 to 100% - 2 hours versus 1.5 when new; 2) The battery doesnt last as long, as when I bought it, but still close to a full day with moderate/heavy use; pages load just a bit slower; 3) The camera is really very good. I had a chance to compare it with that of the new Moto X, and Moto G's camera is definitely better, colors are true and vibrant; 4) Motorola's support is great - lately my phone was not always charging, when connected to a charger, and sometimes a call would drop, and when I called Motorola, I was able to arrange for a free replacement, prepaid mailing label and all; I would buy it again...And of course, the fact that the phone is water-resistant is an added bonus!",17.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-2nd-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4HW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OLIW5q0eL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4HW0,3,99.0,0.0

PROS: - Great battery life. You should have at least 50% on normal usage after one day. - 4G LTE - Small form factor, with a big screen - High quality build. The kevlar is great, and the metal siding is also very strong. There is plastic, glossy material on the camera area, but surprisingly after a month, there isn't even a scratch (no case on it too!). - Micro SD Card adds up to 32GB storage - Decent screen. Not HD like the other Razrs, but the vibrancy of the color balances out the slight pixelation you see. - Quick settings menu. A great addition to the standard Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 - Will be upgraded to Jelly Bean 4.2 in less than 2 months. Promised by Google to be upgraded before the year ends. - Speaker is pretty good - Circles widget. Probably my favorite widget all time, and only the new Motorola phones have it - Great home screen. You start with only one page instead of five, which I find much better. I only have two pages on mine. - Google Now coming soon - Fast Snapdragon S4 processor. Same one as the Samsung Galaxy S III's - It's a phone that actually looks different than all the others. I don't know of any other phone that looks like this. - Big screen at 4.3"". Not a huge screen, but its better than the iPhone 5's 4"". - On screen buttons. I found the hardware buttons frustrating since I would hit them by accident. Glad they moved away from them! And these on screen buttons disappear while watching videos/movies. - Great call quality - Smart Actions CONS: - Occasional lag, but it doesn't get in the way of what you're doing - Once in awhile the data won't come on in low connection areas, while they do on other phones - Camera isn't great. In the dark, the pictures come out weird. My original Razr took better pictures than my Razr M.

22512,B07N91S9MW,Amazon Customer,3,25-Nov-19,True,"A few unnecessary and bothersome features, but overall a great phone.","Overall, it does what it's supposed to do. I really can't complain. But for some finer points to be aware of... The bevels are SO small, that it's hard to even hold the phone without unintentionally touching the screen. This is especially apparent when you're trying to actually touch something else, or swipe, and suddenly things are zooming in and out, not responding, or doing all sorts of weird and unexpected things because you're touching in 2 places. Also, the speaker is painfully loud. A good loud speaker is great, but this one is very piercing, even at lower volume levels. And it's so harsh/treble heavy that any depth is the sound is covered up. For using the speakerphone, it's fine, because it's very easy to hear the other person, but for listening to anything else, it's quite unpleasant. And finally... the teardrop. The extra fraction of an inch in screen size gained by having that teardrop for the camera is pretty much useless, since most apps just block off the screen to the right and left of the teardrop. The ones that don't, don't always work great. Because sometimes what you need to click is hiding behind the teardrop. A stupid feature for almost no gains in usable screen real estate. The screen quality is fine, and the battery life, etc. It does a good job doing the things it's supposed to do.

FTR, my other phones have withstood much more abuse with nary a crack to show for it. I figured I'd get some screen protectors and hope they'd prevent the cracks from expanding. Turned out to be false hope. By the time they arrived, I had cracks cascading down the left side of the glass, and increasing day by day, with no further shock to the device required.

22620,B07N91S9MW,carolina.country,2,25-May-19,False,"First one had bluetooth bugs, second one is great - UPDATE: Second one buggy now, too","EDIT: My SECOND G7 is now having Bluetooth audio streaming issues similar to the first one, after three weeks of it working normally. This time, the volume drops about 50% when streaming music to my vehicle, to my headset, and to my bluetooth speaker. The only way to fix it is to make a phone call via Bluetooth. Then the audio volume goes back to normal. This happens as infrequently as daily; all the way up to every 2-3 minutes. I had no issues for the first 3 weeks of owning my second G7... I am updating the review to 2* from 4*. I love the phone but these bugs are getting out of control. I normally don't write reviews on Amazon unless I buy from Amazon, but I have strong feelings about this phone - some good, some not good. First of all, if you want a phone that takes good pictures, has a beautiful screen, is the perfect size, and plenty fast - but don't want to spend $1000 - this is a superb option. This is ALL THE PHONE 90% OF PEOPLE NEED. I, for one, laugh at the people out there who are willing to go into debt just to have the best phone - yet they don't really need it. Anyway, despite the pluses of the G7, I had an awful experience with Motorola support. The first one I got had Bluetooth connectivity issues from the get go - when streaming music to my vehicle, to my bluetooth speaker, or to my headsets, it would just stop streaming randomly (this happened sometimes every few minutes, but some days it wouldn't happen at all). I am relatively tech savvy so I did all the basic troubleshooting with my BT devices first, then turned off battery optimization for the phone's BT and BT-related apps...did a network reset... did multiple factory resets... no luck. Then I contacted Motorola support and told them all I had done and they didn't even ready my message fully and send me basic troubleshooting steps for a different phone model even. I wanted to bang my head against a brick wall. This continued for weeks, so I passed the 14-day return mark for Motorola.com. I ended up selling that phone at a big loss to a friend who didn't care about streaming music, and I bought another one. The second one does not have these issues and I'm very happy with it. The phone is an outstanding option for those seeking value. I am deducting one star for Motorola's awful tech support. That is my only hesitation in recommending any Motorola product.

4616,B00MWI4KKE,M. Thompson,3,25-May-15,False,"Solid Phone, Not Perfect. An answer to some of the nonsense and misinformation going on here.","UPDATE 2-22-2016 Last update. I don't have this phone anymore. It quit charging, as in the port went bad. So all these things taken together, this is worth it if you can get it cheap. It is a very tough phone, the glass does not crack easily. However it didn't last me that long. So I am now happy with a Galaxy 6 Active, which is the stronger version of the S6. So far so good. That is an awesome phone that I would recommend to anybody BTW. UPDATE 9-4-2015 I changed the rating from 4 to 3 stars because the phone is just not that good. I mention the touch issue lower down in this review, and that is worse than ever. The phone or the screen probably, is just not very good with touch. Whether you do it hard or easy, the touch is awful Did I forget to mention that the loading times, booting or startup is also awful? Well it takes forever when it shouldn't. My wife has an S5 that is a much more solid phone all around, has good touch, is quick, and loads fast. I have changed my recommend to not recommended. There are better alternatives, like the S5 or S6, the Nexus 5 and 6, any of the LG phones seem solid as well. Ok the phone is not perfect. But I have not used any phone that is perfect. First I am going to give the positives and next the negatives. Positives 1. Good signal, never drops calls in the correct service area and the data works fine, again, in the correct service area. 2. Screen is bright and looks very detailed, not low quality or low resolution. 3. Camera works great. I really can't understand why everybody is b**ching about this one. It works just fine for taking normal pictures, or the hundreds of pictures I take daily for my job. Frankly, any camera past 8MP is just fine these days. If you are looking for better zoom, there is no phone that is going to have the zoom capability of a digital camera. It is what it is. 4. Fast processing speed and 2GB of Ram. I know that newer phones are going with 3GB of Ram, but this phone is very fast and gets along just fine with what it has. 5. Tough. Okay so maybe it is not that tough without a case and screen protector, but I have accidentally dropped mine numerous times doing my work and it is still good. The screen is not cracked one bit, or the casing messed up at all. I think the phone is quite tough, but you really need a case for any smartphone. If a drop doesn't ruin the screen it will scuff up the exterior pretty good after awhile. Negatives 1. No memory card slot. This is just boneheaded and the one reason I will not keep this phone for the long haul. The memory that came with the phone is not much, even the 32BG version is not much when you can slap in a 128GB MicroSD card easy, and for fairly cheap. I am not sure why they did not put this in the phone, makes no sense. 2. Touch. Frankly the touch stinks on this phone. It is not sensitive enough. It is bad without a screen protector and obviously worse with it. 3. Android OS. I have no idea why they took forever to get upgraded to 5.0.2, or why it still doesn't have 5.1. The reason I say this is because Motorola also makes the Nexus 6 Google device which is just a stretched and enlarged Moto X, albeit with more Ram and a faster processor. It makes no sense that the Nexus 6 gets the Android OS updates instantly while the others wait forever. But frankly, the whole Android update process is broken anyways. With manufacturers not held to any standard to get those update out ASAP. It needs to be fixed by Google. Overall this is only a slight recommend. I like the screen size and clarity, the features of the phone, and the fact that the phone does not come with much bloatware. But the memory limitation is not good and while I did not mention the battery life, it could always be a little better. My wife has an S5 which is slightly better on battery, despite coming out 5 months before the Moto X did. In fact if you are looking for something reasonable the S5 is probably the way to go between these 2 phones. But like I said, it is tough and not a bad unit, just held back by some silly technical choices.",4.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) XT1097 GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4KKE,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HfPVitlfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4KKE,428,0.0,0.0

If you are okay with camera quality from the early 2000s this phone is great otherwise. If you buy the phone just do one test before the return period ends. Zoom in on something and then take that picture and then look at it in your gallery. It will be unacceptably grainy. Under perfect conditions the pic are passible, in all other situations the quality is really worse than it needs to be. The balancing of light also seems primitive compared to the Droid Turbo 2 I last had. Battery and speed seem to be excellent so far.

I want to 'Ok Google' my phone from across the room and have it answer all my questions. * Beautiful hardware, nice screen, etc. Cons: * Battery life is mediocre * Camera completely stinks. Worse than my previous 3 phones (Nexus 5, HTC One, iPhone 5). * Moto Voice implementation: rather than the Nexus 6's 'Ok Google' hot word detection taking you straight to Google Now voice search, Moto X's hot word detection launches Moto Voice. It only goes to Google Now if it can't figure out what you want. It can rarely figure out what you want, so there's a two second delay on every. stinkin'. search. It's essentially useless. * Twist-to-launch camera gesture is handy, but it forces you to use Motorola's inferior camera app rather than the 'pure' google app, which has better bells and whistles. * Motorola customer service experience #1: I was due a discount at the time of purchase and it didn't get applied. It took me a dozen (yes, literally a dozen) calls to various customer service numbers in order to fix this. I spent probably six hours of my life trying to get my $100. * Motorola customer service experience #2: My screen started to fall off. Annoying, these things happen. In order to get a replacement before sending my phone back to them, they did the usual ""we'll put a $500 hold on your credit card until you send the phone back"". That's fine.

The battery lasts 2 days with “normal”use and about 32ish hours with heavy use. I use the phone for work so I can kill a battery this bad boy lasts all day and some. In fact right now it’s at 50% after 18 hours of some idle time and 8hours very heavy use (email, text, phone calls, some web browsing ). The camera is fine, you need to fiddle a bit with the settings. I did add 128 gb sad card. It was hard to tell if the phone could be expanded, it can. Volume is fine for the occasional speaker phone based call. Bluetooth , WiFi, etc works great. I snap a few pictures but strictly point and shoot and I don’t blast music via my cell phone or watch a lot of video. The main purpose is a communication device for me not a toy.

Amazon has stood behind it, and replaced it with a 2nd phone, with exactly the same results, absolutely can not connect to wifi. so for that, this phone is USELESS. sadly.

14673,B072ZWCKP5,Alex Donovan,4,25-Feb-18,True,"For the price, this blows an iPhone away.","I resisted getting a smart phone until now. I got by with a solid, military grade flip phone, and an iPod touch for years. I was almost always by wifi, so my iPod Touch kept me connected and organized, and my phone took care of calls and texts. I was happy with the combo. Don't get the wrong picture; I enjoy technology. I'm typing this review on a custom built gaming PC. I just don't have a love affair with my phone like so many do today. I've been through two iPod Touch devices, and then Apple discontinued it. My last iPod battery reached its end, so I was out of options. It was time to get a smart phone. Ultimately, it came down to this: Apple products are over priced, and built to fail via OS upgrades or the battery. I couldn't replace the battery myself, and even if I did, the constant OS upgrades would render the iPod Touch useless. iPhones are ridiculously expensive, and the deals that they have with major cell phone carriers aren't deals. They just roll the price of the phone into monthly payments, and/or lock you in. No, thanks. So, Android is the way to go for me, and this Moto E Plus has more than everything that I need. I really like the Google Assistant, it's way better than Siri, and at least as good as Alexa. I especially like that I can use this phone with either Sprint or Verizon by just switching the low cost sim card. More options are better. Also, it looks like the battery is easily replaceable; that's a huge plus when you know that all batteries eventually die. Why would I pay big bucks for the battery limitations of an iPhone? The voice quality is good. The camera and screen are good. The touch screen is responsive. I even saw a video on YouTube where it was submerged in water for a minute, and it survived (don't try this at home). This, and a durable case, is all I need. This will get 4 stars from me for now. If it lasts two years, it will get 5 stars. I really hope it goes the distance.

24819,B07RB78W37,CarlB,5,25-Aug-19,True,Underrated Excellent Mid-range Phone,"I actually ""downgraded"" from a Galaxy S9 due to a year of problems with call reception/quality. The top tech sites all had the same basic complaint with this phone, which was just that you can get a OnePlus 6T or a Pixel 3 for the same price with more features. But after reading about the Pixel 3's laundry list of problems and finding a few forums with people that had ongoing call problems with the OnePlus 6T, I decided I didn't want to risk another year of frustration and gave this one a try. I had good luck with Moto's phones in the past and this one is (so far) living up to that tradition. I do miss wireless charging, but I didn't end up using it as much on my S9 anyway. Plus I can always get a Moto mod for that. I think CNET and the other sites are too harsh on the price. This package makes the price more digestible by including the 360 camera, though I would have rather had my choice of an ""included"" mod. This phone does actually feel and operate much like a higher end phone. When I had it in hand, I didn't feel at all like I had paid too much. it's attractive, has a huge beautiful display, and takes good pictures (not AS good as my S9, but still better than a lot of other phones). It also has near-stock Android 9, which is awesome. And... I can make and take calls without people complaining I'm cutting out or dropping calls - which is of the most important feature of a cell phone in my opinion! The sites also complained about the fingerprint reader, and sure - it is not as good or as quick as the ones that are on the back or side. But it really hasnt given me nearly as much trouble as I was expecting it to. My only real complaint is that it is so thin that it can be tricky to grasp in some situations.

8452,B01DZJFWNC,RSD,5,25-Aug-16,True,If you loved the Nexus 5 - This is your phone!,"Just an update after using a few months. This is a great no frills phone. It fits well in hand and I have actually found I like it day to day better than my LG V10. If you loved the Nexus 5, this is a phone for you. This is a really good phone with the caveat ""for the money"". And that probably isn't a fair thing to say. It works great and feels good in the hand and is smooth, has an excellent camera and just runs well. It is unlocked and works with no problems on my T-Mobile 4G LTE network. Never owned a Moto phone. Have always purchased the carrier phones with the exception of an alcatel 3s I bought for one of my family members. I think if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive option to the $ 600 to $900 devices this is a good option. It is missing some features I've liked in the past like ""knock"" to wake or shut off the screen. I originally purchased an Alcatel 4s during pre-order but it would not play well with T-Mobile 4G LTE. I actually liked the features and screen of the 4s better than this Moto G phone but it was slippery. And they were about the same price. It does not have a lot of cool features or added apps but it works well which some people will like. Pretty much a Google phone although I've added some things I like and that is the beauty and fun of the Android world. The camera is great - and takes much better pics than the Alcatel 4S.and has really given my LG V10 a run for its money. Pictures are accurate, software works fast, quick pics turn out well. Speaker is average but it does face forward and that makes it clearer sounding and not as easily covered by your hand. The battery life this week seems to be very good, and idle management works well with 6.01. Gets me thru a full day without charging and the fast charge gets it charged up as advertised. Call quality has been excellent but I did notice that the volume was not as loud as my V10 or 4S. Hopefully they can issue an update that will make the call volume a little louder. all other apps and music are plenty loud. Wifi and LTE the same. No NFC which is weird. Phone feels good in hand and isn't difficult to operate one handed, unlike my V10. and they make a lot of nice cases already including the Diztronic and the BENTOBEN 2 Piece case (this is a great case for the MOTO G) - many more good case choices than the Alcatel. Also glass screen protector from Mr. Shield is super. Went on perfect and adds a nice feel to the Moto G screen. Finger print scanner is quick and responsive but I wish the scanner also turned off the screen. It sits in a great place and I am used to the integrated scanner on the V10 that turns off and wakes the phone. No stuttering or problems with performance. I think the 4gb RAM and 64 gb on board storage help. The phone does get hot occasionally when I'm uploading or downloading files so I'm going to watch that. I've read the stories about camera video overheat but haven't taken a lot of lengthy video. This device has some stiff competition in that price range including the One Plus 3 and Axxon 7. Both about $100 more but much more robust specs. It reminds me a bit of the original Nexus 5. Affordable, clean, unlocked and likes pure Android (with a few Moto features left in the mix) And just does what it's supposed to.with a much better camera, more memory/storage options and much better battery life. Would recommend this device to people that are looking for quality brand at a very fair price, with no frills /no bloat phone that works well on any network, has good battery life, easy to charge, huge storage, nice screen, excellent camera, good in hand, and is at an excellent price point.",17.0,Motorola,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.)

Small videos would buffer for longer than the video was long, it was reminiscent of dial-up days. Then, there's the durability. The first time I took it running, I stopped to do sit-ups. I put the phone in my front pocket, where it slid out and landed on the ground. A fall of less than the height of the phone and the screen cracked in 4 places.

I was left with a dead battery more than once a day, even after a new battery install. So, it was just time to move on. This phone caught my attention due to the advertised battery life. Motorola claims it can go about 2 days on single charge. I get three days on average. Yes, I said three days. Granted, I only play a couple of apps, make very few calls, but still...three days! I'm impressed. The most power I use is with the camera and an Adobe Photoshop express app, which uses a fair amount of power. Speaking of photos, some reviewers complained about the image quality, but the images I have thus far exceed my old iPhone. Can they compete with DSLR quality? No! But I don't expect them too, for the price I paid. It offers a 'professional mode' which allows the user to control ISO (up to 3200), exposure adjustment, white balance and even aperture control (not as precise as a DSLR!). I attached a sample image.

The problem returned just three weeks after the phone was out of warranty and Motorola will do nothing despite the fact that the phone is undamaged in any way. It's now completely useless - the ghost touch issue means that it can't even be used as a backup MP3 player since it just randomly opens apps and the only way to make it stop is to shut it down.

9903,B01LEL8ABY,Amazon Customer,3,24-Oct-16,True,Fun phone but with some big draw backs,This is a nice light weight/thin phone with really fun items to add on like a camera and speaker system. I purchased everything but the projector. They even sell the large battery pack which snaps on the back to let you use the phone much longer without recharging. Since I had two note 7 phones which I had to return I was really excited about this system. They unlocked it so it works with my carrier T-Mobile. Going out to the Washington coast this weekend I found out something about the phone which is a deal breaker for me and the impetus for this phone's return... T-Mobile had no coverage where I was staying. I signed on to the property's wifi...I could not use wifi for texting or for phone calls. When I called today to Motorola they said it was a carrier issue. When I called T-Mobile they said since it was not a phone they carry they do not support wifi calling or texting. Whhaatt? There are plenty of times when the network does not have good signal...been to Hawaii lately? I always feel pretty safe knowing I can duck into a wifi hotspot and get a connection or help if I need to. Not with this phone. Too bad. The idea of new mods etc was exciting to look forward to. There were other things that did not work as smooth as Samsung phones but I was willing to overlook them because this phone feels exciting and I looked forward to new add on mods. Amazon is a champ for letting me return it within the 30 day period.

1356,B0096QYH80,Eric J Holley,5,24-Oct-12,False,AMAZING!!!,"Traded my iPhone 4 for this even though I am an avid Apple fan. I didn't feel the iPhone 5 upgraded enough to warrant its price tag. Though reluctant at first after a week of using the Droid M I can say with 100% confidence that I made the right decision. Admittedly the phone does come with some annoyances, (ie. the insane amount of bloatware) but it does not effect performance in any capacity. This phone is lightning fast and I have had no problems with the 4G LTE signal and I live in a somewhat rural area. Internet is a vast upgrade from 3G and found its default browser (Google Chrome) to be a bit smoother and more reliable than iOS Safari. As with any android device transferring your music/pictures/movies to the device is seamless and without question easier than iPhone but that is not a surprise to anyone who's familiar with both devices. The Google Play store is easy to find apps/music/videos and really no different (other than more quantity) than apples itunes store. The camera is the only downside to me. Even though apple only had a 5mp camera in the iPhone 4 it took stunning pictures and it was hard for me to give that up. The Droid RAZR M has an 8mp camera but does not take pictures anywhere near the quality my iPhone did. Even though it has a really bright flash it still seems to struggle with depth and detail in low light situations. Phone is sleek, stylish, and very well constructed with strong wear resistant materials such as Gorilla Glass screen, Kevlar backing, and water resistant coating to both the body and electronics inside the phone. You can't dunk it in water but talking on it while in a rain storm will not hurt this device. Google maps and navigation is without question better and easier to use than Apples poor excuse for navigation. When it comes to music/video playback the Droid seemed to have a better picture and much brighter even though it has less resolution then its counterpart. In call sound quality is better on the iPhone but the external speaker/speaker phone is better on the Droid RAZR M. If you're currently an iOS user and are thinking about making the jump to android, don't hesitate.

Very good reception with Mint Mobile/T-Mobile, utilizes band 71 which was important to me and it helps a lot in my section of Maine that were previously dead zones.

18757,B07CHW5KMY,Swan,4,24-Nov-19,True,"Very good, my mostly in-depth review","I bought this phone as a replacement for a 3 year old LG treasure from NET10. I'm still using NET10 and this phone worked really well with the service. A lot of people made me worry about the providers and the SIM cards, but the dual SIM functionality means both the nano and the other kind(I forgot the name lol) work. The major problems I had with the phone was the packing and updating of the phone upon arrival. My phone package came entirely in Spanish. This was inconvenient but it wasn't too hard to figure out. The phone itself wasn't in Spanish, the phone immediate asks you which language you prefer. So don't panic too much if you receive a package in a different language. My other problem was more of an inconvenience that comes with buying any phone. Updating the phone to the newest version of ANDROID software was kind of a pain. It took a full night to get through the 6 or 7 updates. You technically don't have to update it but it's better to bite the bullet as soon as you receive the phone. Some of the extra functionalities that aren't listed include: Gestures, facial unlocking, and an assertive Google assistant that can be avoided if you want to protect your privacy. All of these can be turned off(which is what I did as soon as I found them) but it's still a little annoying. The screen is bright and beautiful, it can be turned down but even its lowest setting is still pretty bright. The sound system is extremely loud and clear. If you're into that then it's perfect, I prefer quieter speakers and headphone interfaces so this is a little annoying. Even the lowest setting is a little too loud for me. The battery lasts a long time (at least compared to my last phone). Something weird about the phone is that the vibration setting isn't adjustable. My last phone allowed a customization tool that controlled the strength, frequency, and pattern of the vibrations. I prefer a single short buzz but this phone has a pretty loud two buzz vibration that is a bit too much for me. It's nice having storage space for once. My only complaint is the lack of a ""clear all cache"" option. So you have to individually clear the cache of each app. The cameras are really good. I don't use them a lot, but if I did it would be a good experience. There's no gallery or independent photo storage app. The only gallery/photo storage app is the Google photos app. I personally dislike the Google photos app but it's really not a big deal. Overall I'm really satisfied with the phone! I love it a lot and I'm happy about the price I got it for.

7253,B0192XJ0P6,Korey,1,24-Nov-16,False,Worst Cell Phone I've had - issues caused by updates were unable to be fixed by Verizon.,"I got a Droid Turbo 2 phone a year ago at the Verizon store after I accidentally dropped my Droid X and wrecked the screen. My Droid X worked well with no issues for 5 years. The Droid Turbo 2 is the worst phone I have ever had. It has a great screen which is why I give it two stars. The phone worked fine until the first forced update. After that I had horrible buzzing during some phone calls which I could hear and so could the people I called. Also the volume control went bad. The buttons would raise and lower the volume but I would not hear the changes in the volume while I was doing it. Again this worked fine until the first update. I went to Verizon to get help both on line and in person and nothing helped. The last in person tech said he had never seen the volume problem before and couldn't replicate the buzzing even though he had heard of the issue. His only recommendation was to buy a different phone from Verizon - He recommended Samsung phones even the exploding 7's. No help from them at all. Go figure. Would I buy this phone again? NEVER Would I recommend this phone? NEVER Would I recommend people buying a refurbished one? NEVER I have been pleased with Verizon's service staff in years past. But they get no marks for helping with the Turbo 2. If you internet search for Motorola Droid Turbo 2 and buzzing you will see that this is a known issue and has been known for a while. I wish I had known before I bought it last year. One final beef. Verizon now requires people to hook their phones up to Wi-Fi to finish the phone updates. What is up with that? My Droid X updated via Verizon's network. It's weird that a cell phone company can't even trust its own network to do updates. UPDATE 3/11/17 - After the latest forced update (Nougat - 3/4/17) 3 things changed so badly on the phone that I actually tried going to a Verizon Store again for help. In the first store the guy was so rude, I walked out. In a second store, a nicer tech went over the issues I had and two of them could not be resolved. He tried to resolve the 3rd issue - which was the main screen rotating when it had never done that before in my 6.5 years of using an Android phone. His only fix was to stop the screen rotation completely. I didn't know that until I got home and saw the phone wouldn't rotate when I tried to type in Messenger. I don't know about you but I can not type in Messenger without the keyboard being rotated horizontally. I went back to the store, had that undone and was told I'd either have to have all rotation stopped or live with it. So this phone is even worse off now then when I bought it.

Still getting used to the Motorola interface and difference in the settings and dialer and messaging app compared to my old phone. I add a 128gig card from my previous phone and the system instantly recognized it. All I had to do was pop in the SIM from my other phone and it was on the AT&T network. If the phone can hold up to my use as I carry it with me while I work. The reason for only 3 phones has to do with Walmart service and specially there warranty service which was offered as I was purchasing the phone and told plainly on the ordering web page that I would have 30 days to pickup an extended warranty. However now that I have the phone and its working great on the AT&T network here in Billings MT I want to keep it and purchase the extended warranty.

10868,B01MDMJGYT,Meh,1,24-Jun-18,True,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased the Z Play factory unlocked smartphone because I didn't want to have to deal with a carrier phone preloaded with bloatware around early December 2017. 6 months later, in June, I reach for my phone in my pocket and it doesn't turn on. Strange, I thought, as it had a full charge when I left. Nothing responded. The phone wouldn't charge up, and it would sporadically flash white for a second or two. I researched it and found others had the same problem, where the screen malfunctions. I took it to AT&T to see if they could do a quick fix; they could not and recommended I contact Motorola. I knew Amazon has a 90 day return policy and this was three months past that, but I figured it's a Moto phone, let Motorola fix or replace it. I called their customer service line and read them the IME and model number. They couldn't find it in their system, but I figured maybe it was a bad connection or the customer service rep wasn't inputting it correctly. They asked me to send them proof of purchase from Amazon and pics of the box (which I still had, that had the model/IME numbers.) They told me they wouldn't honor it, because it wasn't purchased through an approved Motorola vendor. I alerted Amazon about this, but there's nothing they can do either. So, after only 6 months, I'm out $345 (plus accessories and apps.) Save your money and don't buy any cellphones that aren't coming from your carrier.

22976,B07NYBD9DW,Amazon Customer,5,24-Jul-19,True,Who needs $900 cell phones?,"This phone is an incredible bargain. The screen is sharp and clear. The speed of the phone completing tasks or responding to commands is quick. The camera and picture appears to me to be as good as my previous iPhone or Samsung phones. But I am not a professional photographer. I don't intend to take or expect professional photographs from a cell phone. The battery lasts two full days with moderate to heavy use. Three days with more normal or less demanding usage. The interesting part of the usage curve is that it seems to use very little power for phone calls and after an hour long phone call the drop in battery was minimal. I cannot see much difference between the qualities of this phone and the $900 phones Verizon or AT&T would like me to buy. My son who has one of these $900 Samsung phones compared the his with mine and there was a small bit of difference in the speed, but not appreciable. This test was on a game. Otherwise, in all other tests, the two phones functioned the same. If you are willing to pay $700 more for a few seconds of speed difference, be my guest.

22634,B07N9M9FX4,BobofWy,2,24-Jul-19,True,RETURNED AFTER 10 DAYS,"I bought two of the Moto G7's to use with T-Mobile. I live in Cheyenne, Wyoming where the T-Mobile service is equal to a much bigger city. T-Mobile introduced Band 71 here in Cheyenne back in 2017 as one of two test cities for the country. So I had two main problems with the Moto G7. First of all, the signal was horrendous. I live 6 blocks from the State Capital building and couldn't get much more than 1 bar on the most of the time. If I walked into the basement, zero bars. Go outside in the backyard and Wi-Fi would drop off. Absolutely ridiculous. Yes, there is WI-FI calling so if the bars drop to zero you can still call. But really in a town that has all the T-Mobile bands? It shouldn't happen. So, the antenna used by Motorola is pretty pitiful. Perhaps if you live in a really big city it would be okay. But if your rural by any means, forget it. Next problem. I loaded 12 apps on the G7 and half of them would not run on Wi-Fi. Which apps wouldn't run? How about Netflix, Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Capital One and Fidelity Investments. It didn't matter if you used 2.4 or 5 Ghz, same story. But if I turned off my Wi-Fi in the settings on phone, Wah lah, every app worked on the T-Mobile Cellular Data. All of these sites require a user name and password to authenticate to allow you entry. I did have 2 apps (Discover and Chase Bank) that worked on Wi-Fi. Apps such as Google translate, Weather.com worked with no problem. This occurred on both phones I purchased along with each having a weak signal. Now, Motorola's technical support worked fine as long as you go through the steps. First I chatted on-line with a level 1 technician with basically trying everything I already did. Reboot the phone, clear cache, clear data, uninstall and reinstall app. Did not work. After 15 minutes I was bumped up to a Level 2 Technician. Motorola took my phone number and within 5 minutes the Level 2 Technician called. He was in the Philippines. I explained to him what the problem was with the apps and Wi-Fi. So he got the Motorola G7 Power they use to test problems with and together as I explained what was going on, each of us downloaded and installed Hotels.com. I tried to access the site and Hotels.com kept telling my password was wrong. It wasn't. So the technician used his personal Hotels.com account and tried. He also could not get into Hotels.com on Motorola's Wi-Fi at the service center. We both turned off Wi-Fi on the phone and each of us were able to get into Hotels.com immediately. I then told him of the several other apps that wouldn't work. What happened? I was bumped up to a Level 3 Technician. After going through basically the same steps and explaining the problem, the technician finally concluded that the problem was much bigger than he thought. He recommended I send back the two Moto G 7's as defective and get my money back. Motorola does have a no questions ask 14 day return policy. So this is what I used. The service technicians were all very nice and helpful. And yes, as you went to levels, each had more knowledge than the last. I'm pretty knowledgeable about computers and networking since I owned a Computer/Networking Services company for 25 years before I retired. I believed the problem was with the permission or authentication as I worked through this problem. The Level 3 Technician from Motorola agreed. One last comment.... This problem was blogged about on the Motorola website back in February 2019. So other folks have had this issue. A Motorola technician responded to the blog asking what equipment the one gentlemen was using but never responded after that. I told each of the technicians this fact.

24505,B07QP7WZ1T,Thorny,4,24-Jul-19,True,Great Phone!,"UPDATE: OK, downgrading this to a 4-star after using it in the field for a couple of months. Why? two reasons: It's heavy (added a thick strong durable case) and it's a little too big to do everything with one hand on my birding app. I have to let go of the binoculars and two hand the recording. Not a big deal for most phone buyers I know. And with all this said, I do not think I can find a better phone for what I need it for. They wouldn't have the power or durability of this phone. Still highly recommended for anyone for whom battery life is a primary concern in a decent phone. I've had this phone for two days now an am quite satisfied. Unbelievable price for this quality phone! My main reason for getting this was for field work that involves entering data into phone apps that burn power. I always had to carry a portable charger with me to get through the day. Plus, my old phone, a Moto G5 was too fragile for that kind of wear and tear. And occasionally having so many apps open would crash the most memory heavy of them. This is one sturdy phone and I haven't had to charge it since initial set up. It's a little heavy, but for what I need it for that is OK because my need for durabiliy and battery life trump weight. This phone powers the apps without difficulty and survives. It's one great piece of field gear, yet looks sleek and stylish in everyday life too. Motorola has done it again. They consistently produce excellent inexpensive phones that rival competitors phones that cost hundreds more. I hope to revisit this review some time down the road and give an update on how it holds up to field work abuse and maintaining its status as an impressive, stylish device. Recommend without reservation as of today.

The Moto Z blows it out of the water in terms of performance. 4GB RAM, 64 GB internal memory, SD 820 processor, Adreno 530... All good upgrades, except the battery capacity is lower. 5X has 3000 mAh battery, this is at 2600. I'm sure with the SD 820 there's better energy management, but still, a higher capacity would be nice; however, due to this aspect this phone is super thin and light in comparison. The camera isn't something worth oogling about. It's not bad, just not as good as some of the others in it's price range. I actually got this for $185 on Prime Day (super awesome deal on something that never came out of the box since it was manufactured). When using the camera, I can't tell if I've been drinking or if the phone is drinking because it'll follow in whatever direction you move and sway. Lag or adaptive tech, hard to say.

7315,B0192XJ0P6,lns500,5,24-Jul-16,False,Wow! I'm impressed!,"I have had this phone for four days now, used it constantly, and charged it ONCE! I am a Verizon customer so am always sort of locked into Motorola Droid whenever I get an upgrade, and my main gripe with Droids is that they didn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. The claim that this phone holds a charge for 48 hours seemed too good to be true, yet although it hasn't gone a 'full' 48 hours, it's come pretty close! I let the battery drain completely (as advised, to increase battery life) and I was also impressed at how quickly it charged! It went from 0% to 100% in about half an hour, and the phone stayed charged for the next 32 hours. It has a nice big screen with great resolution, and although mine came with apps I didn't want (NFL, for example) that you can't delete, this is only a small annoyance. Also, there seems to be issues in adding my work email (I have never had these issues with Droids before, so it must be a 'Turbo 2 thing'), but I added all my gmail stuff in about a minute and it's all working fine. Another great feature of this Turbo 2 (maybe others had this, too, but I just didn't notice) is that you can change the type of English for the Moto or Google voice input/output. I have a British accent, so voice-to-text or any voice activation was always a problem on my other Droids, as the system didn't recognize a British accent and would often translate this into gibberish. On the Turbo 2, you can change voice recognition to different accents, and for the first time EVER, I can write a voice text without putting on a bad American accent!

18349,B07C2VFMN2,Amazon Customer,1,24-Feb-19,True,DONT BUY THE 64GB IF YOU HAVE SPRINT! 32GB IS ONLY ONE THAT WILL WORK!,"So a few things to comment about. Bought it back in late 2018 just before the holidays. Motorola was nice enough to jack the price up an extra $100, and that's when I hit buy. Then to my anger, dropped it back down, so the phone looked like it was $100 and on sale. Should be zapped for price gouging and shaddy business practices. That being said, on to the next part. The 64GB unlocked phone is NOT compatible with the Sprint simcards, and their Network. How do I know? The never ending msg of invalid sim card, and loss of signal. That trick took about a month to show up. And yes I'm on my 5th sim card, and second phone. It's a known software issue, and might be fixed some day. Motorola is nice enough to let me down grade to the 32GB and a free Moto mod, or refund full price. I opted for the camera mod since I have the battery already. On the plus side, they didn't say sucks to be you and not help, so that's cool. Other then the sim card issue, great phone, love(d) the big storage, and it's fast and lasts a long time if not playing games on it. If it didn't have the sim issues, I'd keep it until I needed another phone.",4.0,Motorola,Motorola Z3 Play & Moto Power Pack - Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) - 64GB - Deep Indigo (US Warranty) - PA9S0000US,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z3-Play-Power-Pack/dp/B07C2VFMN2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N-Axwzz1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07C2VFMN2,84,229.99,499.99
10931,B01MDMJGYT,I. Pham,4,24-Feb-18,False,It'll do.,"I was so happy to be back with Motorola as it brought back the nostalgia of the pre-iPhone/smartphone era where everyone had to have the RAZR or other Motorola model. I have mixed feeling about this phone but do enjoy using it. The good... Large and vibrant high resolution screen. It has a mode for realistic and vibrant colors depiction. Large body on upper and bottom. May be a con to some looking for a slimmer screen to body ratio. I like this as it provides a good tactile quality to the phone and prevents accidental swipes and presses. Mods. They actually pulled off the mods. I've never used any but have heard good things. The bad... Screen to body ratio. Depends on your preference...see previous section. Absolutely finnicky and inconsistent Bluetooth. It will forget how to connect to remembered devices. Once it could not connect to my earbuds despite being able to detect 15 other nearby devices. Bluetooth ain't new Motorola/Lenovo. Any weird development kinks should have been smoothed out by now. I was able to remedy this eventually but why is this an issue? This totally reminds me that I got what I paid for. No native gallery, media player apps. I was so confused. It uses a barebones skinned version of Android. You need to use Google's own apps or download your own. The camera is good and adaquate but does not compare to LG's camera with the double lens and wide angle. It definitely cannot hold a candle to Samsung's cameras. Despite the criticism, it'll do. Some customization options are lacking. You cannot change the lockscreen independently from the home screen. You cannot change system font. I came from an LG G5 and miss this. Emojis are heavily skinned. Texts to your iPhone using friends may be strained in meaning. Smilies are gumdrops shaped. In conclusion... Overall a good phone. Not the best, but it'll do. It's price is at an excellent price point for what you get. This phone was a replacement for my LG G5 which, after only a year's use, had one side of the screen freeze rendering it useless.

After searching for a replacement I found the the Nexus 5 was no longer available and the Nexus 6 is too expensive for this college girl. I was hesitant to buy the Moto G (2nd gen) at first, $180 for a no contract smartphone, whats the catch? However, I am so happy I took the chance the Moto G can keep up with some of the best smartphones out there. Like most college students I spend lots and lots of time on my phone. The Moto G was able to keep up with all the texting, talking, email, twitter, pinterest, etc. with little to no lag time. The screen looks great - I would say better than my nexus 4. Even on a very low brightness it looks awesome. Battery life is leaps and bounds better than the Nexus 4. I am able to go all day (about 8am when I leave for work until 9pm when I get home from school) without charging my phone while still using it all day. *I do have the screen set to a low brightness and am not constantly on the phone the whole day, but I would say I use my phone more than the average person.

To be honest; in terms of capabilities I do not understand why people plunk down $800 and more for a top of the line phone brand or model, because this phone is just as good. Maybe if you are a ""gamer"" a faster processor might pay off, but nevertheless, the quad-core processor in this phone is more than powerful enough for 90% of users, and then some. I was glad to see Lenovo brought back the magnetic compass sensor int his G6 phone, which they had dropped in the G4. Also, GSM function works perfect with high sensitivity, even with GLONASS. And ready for Galileo, if these Europeans ever get their act together. I also like the fact that this phone is both GSM and CDMA compatible, (quad band) which means you can use it for just about any provider, and any part of the world.

22593,B07N91S9MW,Felipe,5,23-Sep-19,True,Fantastic quality/price ratio. Amazing phone under $300!,"I have normally gone for top of the line phones, I have had iPhones,high-end Xperias and my previous phone was a Galaxy S8. The equivalent now, the S10 was around $1000, so I tried my luck with another Motorola, since I really like my previous Moto G5. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, but after a year, I am very happy I gave this model a try. It does 95% of what my S8 did, at a fraction of the price. Screen is huge and very comfortable. It is rootable! For me, very very important, and a big plus, since the G950U (S8) can't be rooted for practical uses. I really love the clean approach to Android, having an almost pure vanilla of the system, and none of the hundreds useless apps and customizations that Samsung puts in its phones and that it is impossible to remove. The sound quality, I am a big aficionado to High Fidelity, is OK, but not as good as the Samsung. I also had a bit of remorse about this, until I realize there are various inexpensive USB C DAC that solves the problem and provides and excellent sound quality. I am seriously considering selling my Fiio X5ii DAP and start using this phone with a DAC as my daily driver. Photo quality is pretty good, don't expect iPhone quality, but I can't barely notice it being a notch down below the Galaxy. It definitely has enough quality for the usual pics of the kids. And it's always years ahead any Xperia. I truly only miss the waterproof resistance of the S8. Signal reception could be better. I had issues while on the train in the beginning, but nothing serious. Either is not too bad, or it got corrected in one of the firmware updates. I love the fact that if it ever breaks, I would not suffer as I only paid $250. All in all, another great product from Motorola (Lenovo). Fantastic quality/price ratio, will keep on checking their products in the future. If you are on the verge, go get this one.

1357,B0096QYH80,J.T. Melanson,5,23-Sep-12,False,A great alternative to the Galaxy S3,"Let me start off by saying I was a Sprint customer for 3 years, during that time, their service went from great to serviceable to downright crappy. I had initially wanted to ditch Sprint the moment I found out I was screwed over for even a partial upgrade last year, I was PO-ed when I found out they switched their upgrade cycle once again to a straight-up 20 months and did nothing to rectify the situation. Originally wanting to go with T-Mobile, I instead opted to get on Verizon since my uncle had a line available. I waited until my contract with Sprint was up, which was literally about 13 days ago, before I took the plunge. I also had my eye on the Galaxy S3 too, but I was so desperate to get off of Sprint that I did look at alternative phones. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I came across the Droid RAZR, and then the RAZR M shortly afterward. Originally I was thinking of getting the RAZR, but imagine my double surprise when I found out I could get 135 bucks on my trade-in towards the RAZR M by trading in my HTC EVO 4G, a phone I reviewed on here a while back. My uncle okayed the transfer, and I was good to go. I am happy to say that the difference between Sprint and Verizon is night and day! I don't worry about dropped calls anymore at my house, since I no longer have to struggle to get a signal, I usually get two to three solid bars. With Sprint I was lucky to get one bar, and it was on ""digital roaming"", three bars came and went too. 4G LTE on Verizon is readily available and is as quick as greased lightning, to say Sprint is lagging in this area would be an understatement. Also, if I use WiFi at a hotspot like Dunkin' Donuts or McDonald's or in my house, I can disable Mobile Data effectively eliminating the prospect of going over the allotted data plan and the like, and still do the things I like doing on this badboy such as searching on the 'net, Facebook, etc. Also, while people criticize the cheap feel of the bezel of the phone because of the visible screws on the sides, honestly, I don't pay attention to the screws at all. I am more impressed with the fact that the bezel is almost non-existent, and I find the phone to be sleak, sexy, and feather light. It almost feels non-existant in my pocket at times because it's so light. And yet it sports a 4.3"" Super AMOLED qHD Display, and I feel personally it's screen is so much better than the EVO 4G I had before. Yes, I know it's not as good as the screen on say the Galaxy S3, but to me it is a massive step up from what I had before. The battery life on the thing is superb. Had it off it's charger for a solid 12 or so hours one day, and with heavy use, the thing was still holding strong at 35%. With the EVO 4G I was lucky to get half that. I was told by the salesperson that the RAZR M sported a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor, but did more research and found out it uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chip, the exact same chip employed by the Galaxy S3. I was wondering why games were so ridiculously smooth, playing Angry Birds on this thing when compared to the EVO? Again, night and day. Smooth like butter, not a trace of slowdown. Yes, it doesn't have 2 Gigs of RAM like the S3, but for what it has, it does a wonderful job. Android Ice Cream Sandwich is also strikingly easy to use once you get down to the nitty gritty of it. I love the fact that the BLUR interface Motorola once employed in earlier smart phones is just about gone. The interface is pretty much stock Android, and unlike with earlier versions, it looks damn good and is easy to access. It took me a bit to get used to having virtual buttons at the bottom of the phone as opposed to physical buttons, and I'm still learning some of the ins and outs of this badboy, but all in all I am extremely satisfied with this phone. It might not be the Galaxy S3, which let's face it, as of this writing is the king of smartphones in terms of features. But what it is, is a rock-solid alternative for those whom want a great smartphone with tons of features on a budget. Update 10/13/12: I actually found out what a tough little phone this thing really is, during a rainy day, I was cooking burgers on the grill and went outside to go check on them, I ended up slipping and falling on the ramp we designed for my grandmother two times, the second time I hit my back pretty hard. I had my phone with me, and it fell out of my pocket. The thing was completely in tact, not a scratch, ding, dent or anything, and it still works as good as ever. Update 01/07/13: A few months ago, I had this phone updated to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, while it hiccups here and there, all in all it still holds up remarkably well. I recall it was at the 5 month cycle that I had started having problems with the HTC EVO 4G when I was with Sprint. So far, no problems here at all. It's still as tough as frigging nails, I had dropped it accidentally a second time, and still no damage to the phone at all. Battery still holds up very well too, still getting anywhere from 8 - 16 hours on a charge depending on the usage. I'm quite satisfied, hopefully this badboy will last me until September of 2014 when I am eligible for an upgrade. Update 03/28/13: Sadly my uncle could not afford the upkeep of the Verizon account even with my contribution, ergo I no longer have this phone. Needless to say I am back with Sprint thanks to this. However, with the trade-in credit from the RAZR M, I was able to get one of the best phones on the market which I will be reviewing.

My husband has an older Moto phone and it actually has a better camera. I have not been impressed with this camera in terms of clarity, color balance (so many blue undertones compared to other phones). Battery life is awesome! I can go 2-3 days without charging my phone. This is a new found freedom compared to my iphone that died by 3pm every day (and randomly shut down!) Love that it has an expandable SD card, as storage space was an additional reason I moved away from my iphone.

I quite liked the phone and wasn't ready to give it up. I thought it was a good solution to buy this one (at $115). Unfortunately, after watching the tracking updates nearly by the minute, the phone was back in UPS hands for the return trip within an hour. For starters, the phone I received was not the phone pictured. This phone had a lot of personalization options new so I understood and was fine with it being a bit differently colored (trim and ""M"" on the back). However, THE PHONE WAS UNUSABLE. It was AT&T branded meaning added bloat wear (again I could overlook that). The phone was unable to process an OS update. It froze. It was unusable, and had to be returned with much frustration. Amazon is wonderful about returns, but it means more time without a phone (and Sat Nav, and music, and books, and my pocket Bible :)). I decided to spend a bit more and get the Moto G5 Plus.

I've seen youtube videos saying you may get more bandwidth on T-Mobile with HSPA+ than an overloaded AT&T LTE network. Music streaming and app downloading has been great no delays. 20Mb apps from the play store seem to be downloading over HSPA+ in about 30 seconds. The MicroSD slot was great.

I chose the Motorola Droid Razr M over all other phones for the following attributes: - Best antenna and thus reception of any phone mfg. - I can stream Pandora and surf the internet with no interuptions in what is known as a bad cell reception area. - Best battery life of any mfg. of phones (second best in Motorola's lineup) - Great processor speed and Dual core (second to the GS3) - Fast while surfing. - Swype and adaptive voice to text/email are the best with Motorola's android system and not available w/ I phone. - Very sharp graphics. - Really like the interface and find the phone very easy to use (plus Jelly Bean will be upgraded to it later this year). - I keep it in my front pocket and its small enough (yet a big screen) and light. This phone has been nothing but AWESOME the first 3 weeks I've owned it. All of the reasons that I bought it for, above, are right on and real. Love this phone.

9828,B01LEL8ABY,Rich,4,23-May-18,True,Tale of Two Phones,"This is my second Moto Z. I purchased one last year, and really like it. Overall, it is a solid phone. My biggest issue is with the ridiculous desire by Lenovo/Motorola to make this the ""thinnest"" phone for some reason. This results in a product with limited battery life. I wanted a wireless charging phone, and with the wireless charging back shell, this works well. After going this route, I decided to find one of the wireless charging battery pack Moto Mods, which are out there, but not as readily available as some of the other novelty mods. The design of the phone, with the desire to have either a wireless or wireless/battery mod mounted all of the time severely limits protection choices. The only comfortable choice I could locate was the Incipio bumper case. But you'll need to make sure you get the right one. The Moto Z, Moto Z Play and Moto Z Force all have different phone dimensions (thicknesses) resulting in a spat of bad reviews for this case (i.e. phone falls out of case). One of the reasons I have gravitated to the Lenovo/Motorola phones was the limited modifications to the stock Android platform. Unfortunately, one of my previous purchases after the early Moto G phones, was a Moto X Pure Edition........which was supposed to see quicker updates. Not even close. My first Moto Z though already received the Oreo update two weeks ago. Unfortunately, that was about the same time my phone took a tumble and cracked the corner of the glass screen. I decided to replace this phone with another Moto Z, so I bought my second one and received it yesterday. I always try to purchase items on Amazon that are actually ""fulfilled by Amazon"", regardless of the seller. This usually means that I get what I ordered. In setting it up and loading the updates, I realized that something was ""off."" After looking at the phone details, I realized that what I received was not a US edition (Software Channel = retus). Instead, I received an Asion Pacific variant (Software Channel = retapac). This meant that the Oreo update my previous Moto Z got did not come through on this phone. I requested a call from Amazon Technical Support. The customer service rep was very pleasant, but had to arrange a return of this phone, as it is not the US Retail version as advertised. In addition, I'm not going to purchase another and gamble on having to return that one. Overall, I like the power and overall performance of the Moto Z, but I'm not sure making this purchase on Amazon is the best choice anymore.",1.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

3375,B00HPP3QD6,Perry Warner,4,23-May-14,True,Good price AND has lots of features with Android 4.4 - has KitKat!,"First off, I'm going to introduce myself as someone who loves their electronics, but doesn't have the budget to pay for all that I want! As a student with a part time job, I need a phone, but in no way can I afford to pay the contract plans everyone - including most of my friends - seem to get. Unless you're entering a contract with a bunch of people, you are going to pay at least 70$ USD per month (depending on carrier, for Verizon you have to pay 40 per month per smartphone and 50 per month for the individual BASE service plan [500 MB cap]) and is just not a good value, unless you HAVE to have the latest smartphone with the best features, such as the beautiful Galaxy Note 3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5. My TOTAL plan cost for this phone with Verizon is 45$ per month flat, and I get unlimited TALK and TEXT, with 500MB of data - AT+T has a similar no contract plan available, and I'm assuming other carriers have close to this per month cost as well. I did a lot of research into what might be good values for no-contract and prepaid phones, and it basically came between this phone (99$ but locked to Verizon), the unlocked version of this phone (199$), the unlocked Galaxy S3 (199$), the iPhone 4 (199$) and the goofy knock-off-Windows Nokia Lumia 520 and 521 (54.99, AT+T// 69.99, T-Mobile). I won't go into the pros/cons of each phone, but this phone had significant points that bought me over. Pros: Snappy Dual-Core processor, perfect for flipping between tasks, opening word documents, browsing the web.. and my favorite, running GameBoy Advance emulators - something you can't do on IPhones (IOS) or windows phones (Nokia Lumia series). 8GB of Flash Storage - plenty, to be honest. Remember, you're buying a Smartphone! This means if you want music, you have many outlets, i.e. Pandora, Slacker radio, Youtube, Spotify.. This means the 8GB you are given will go a long way to hold photos or games you might want to install. Google Drive - Cloud storage for your music files, videos you purchase through Google Play, Photos, ect. This is what makes the quantity of storage you get worth it. Office Suite - built in QuickOffice suite is pretty self explanatory; you get a fast little word processing app/spreadsheets/presentations. For jotting down notes (which I do a lot) the Word option is very sufficient. Voice to Text - Facilitated by a WiFi (or 3G) connection to Google, it is possible to - using the base Google touch keyboard - literally talk text into your phone. This is not a gimmick, the accuracy is quite good and the tracking is fast, I impress people daily about how well thought out and QUICK my text replies are. Absolutely an awesome feature. Battery Life - Awesome! If the phone remains in ""sleep mode"" (screen off) I have seen this battery last for over a week if not used much beyond simple calls and texts. Additionally, with web browsing and hours of GameBoy Advance emulators compounding to roughly 3 hours of screen on and processing power, I charge this phone roughly once every three days. This is quite good, and my HP Pavilion 14"" laptop has worse battery retention when performing the same web browsing intensity. Verizon's network - I have no other option in the area. AT+T gets calls dropped often, Sprint and T-Mobile has 1 / 0 bar service places and I've not seen people attempt other minor carriers. With Verizon around where I live I get a solid 2-3 bars most of the time, and I have not experienced a single dropped call/poor quality anywhere within a 70 mile radius. Cons: 1 GB of RAM is eaten up by multiple processes quickly. If you are a power user like me you WILL have to do some memory management - my 360 Mobile Safe Antivirus/Memory management app tells me that the system uses 40% of this all the time, and it doesn't take much to fill up the remaining 600MB of System RAM. Luckily, Google gives you some powerful memory management capabilities built in, but the mentioned 360 Mobile Safe App (that is free) has a one-button memory dump, which is quite nice. No Micro-SD card slot - Definite con. You can remedy the lack of Flash Storage with cloud storage, but this isn't ideal, and was enough of a problem to drop the phone down one star. 3G only - You can't get hyperspeed on this phone, unfortunately. Sorry guys, you can't host this phone as a mobile hotspot AND get better download speeds you get on a home WiFi... Why would you want to anyway? 3G is plenty fast for streaming Pandora, watching Youtube videos and Browsing the Web. Any more is just going to destroy the meager data plan you're going to buy anyway.",105.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0
132,B002UHS0UI,Stephen,5,23-May-12,False,Old Faithful,"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well.

10938,B01MDMJGYT,Max Harry Johnson,5,23-Jun-17,True,best Moto device ever made value-wise,"I have used various Moto devices before, mainly first three Moto X and Gs. I was skeptical of the Lenovo acquisition and the new Z serious, but I decided to give the Moto Z Play a try mainly because it was a good price for the specs and I was I'm looking forward to the Lenovo's new wireless charging and gamepads they'll be releasing in summer 2017 which I will be buying. I have to say the Moto Z Play is probably my favorite smartphone ever in term of value. For the price, it is well built and have a sturdy frame (although you need to protect the glass back), the 1080p AMOLED screen is great, the software is clean and responsive, you get access to the Moto Mods, and everything else works solidly. The main thing I like with Moto devices is the stock Android software so the phone run smooth and fast. Before I was using the more expensive LG G6, but because it had bloated Android skin, it's actually slower and less enjoyable to use despite having a faster processor. The best thing about this device is the big battery that is coupled with a power efficient processor, as a result you can get up to two days of battery life, or 8-10 hours screen on time. Also the phone rarely get hot, a problem with more expensive Android flagship phones at the moment. Unfortunately, because Lenovo realized what a good value this phone is, they have reduced the battery life for Moto Z2 Play, so we won't likely see another Moto device with such a good value again. There are not too much negatives for the price. The camera is average, but very acceptable for the price. The device is a little big and it is relatively heavy as well, if you come from iPhone or Samsung devices which tends to be lighter. Of course, at this price range water resistant is not included. Verizon sells a bumper for this device that have an open back so you can still use Moto Mods with phone.

18877,B07CHWTWYP,Julia,4,23-Jul-18,True,"Good for the price, but is isn't my Samsung...","I did some research on affordable but high quality Android phones, and this one was highly recommended. It arrived in a sealed, obviously new box and the fact I was able to find a new phone for the price is truly remarkable. I experienced no difficulty activating it on my GSM network. It runs smoothly and isn't slow, the battery lasts awhile (my 8+ hour work shift with light usage - music, occasional texts - plus several hours of constant usage before bed) and I'm thrilled the back is plastic and therefore more durable than fragile glass backing. The dual camera is nice to have, but I haven't noticed it being any higher quality than my previous one-back-camera phones.I LOVE the location of the finger print sensor, it's convenient and easily accessible. The turbo charger is amazing, but I still use my 10ft much slower cable for convenience unless I need to charge it quickly. There are a few things I absolutely hate about this phone, but for the overall price and performance, it's not enough to remove more than one star from the rating. I wrongly assumed that while it's obviously not a Samsung, that Motorola would still have its own set of applications such as music and a photo gallery. It comes with Google music and Google gallery, and I detest both of them and have since found replacements (I love the customization of Androids). The screen isn't very sensitive, meaning that I have to press harder than I'm used to for it to be responsive. The earphone slot isn't manufactured correctly, and I have to toggle with it far more than I should. This is a common issue with the Moto G6 Play, and other users shared similar issues. That being said, I can still listen to music with earphones/an aux cord, it just takes some inconvenient positioning. Overall, I'm mostly happy with my purchase, but I will be leaping towards the Samsung Galaxy S9 as soon as my budget allows.

22146,B07MF3JM4T,HAYS Z WALLER,4,23-Jan-19,True,First two days observations UPDATE,"I did weeks of research and was already set one the Android One line. It came down to the Nokia, Moto One Power and the Xiaomi Mi A2. I have have been a Moto user for at least 6 years and was currently using the Moto Z Droid which I have loved. The Droid the last few weeks would simply shut off even with full battery. After some digging I found out this was common for the Z line and there really isn't much of a solution if not under warranty. I could replace battery but I figured it may be time for a new phone anyway - begin the Youtube reviews! When I decided to stick with Moto (mainly because I know I would miss the Moto gestures which I have become accustomed too) I went with the Android One Power. I know it's not as spec heavy as the other choices but it being Moto and the incredible batt life life sold me. When the phone arrived I quickly realized this was NOT the One power but simply the Moto One. Of all the research I did, how did I miss this??? I honestly didn't know there was another ""One"" that wasn't the One Power... So I looked it up and saw that the specs were lower than Power; battery, screen size, processor, etc... Since I already went low spec wise I was concerned I may have even downgraded from my 2016 Z Droid! I was already thinking about going back to the drawing board but figured I'd give it a shot - thank you Amazon. Firstly, as mentioned above; one of the main reason I stuck with Moto was the gestures. Come to find out, this Moto phone does NOT have the hand wave wake feature! This was a big deal to me. It does have the flashlight (not near as bright as my 2016 Droid light) and camera gesture but NOT my favorite feature of being able to wave my hand over display for it to wake. I really hope they can include this in an update but I don't get why they would cancel this feature?!?! Oh well, strike one. Then I realized the battery was smaller than the Moto One POWER. Strike two. So far I will say the batt life is still MUCH better than my Z Droid. I will know more after a few more days but seems ok. The phone seems fast enough but not a great improvement over the Droid from two years ago. A couple good things about this phone. The Dolby option is INCREDIBLE. If you are a sound/music guy this is a wonderful feature. Playing through my car it's like I got a new sound system. Really cool. I haven't tried with my Audio Technica's (has headphone jack) yet but I'm sure that will be nice too. The other nice feature obviously is Android Pie. A very cool interface and that my Apple son compares to his iphone. He was impressed for whatever that is worth... PROS Android Pie Dolby Sound feature CONS Not all Moto gestures!! Big for me - please fix -Cannot wake phone other than picking up and hitting button/fingerprint BATT not near as big as Moto One Power All said and done the phone is growing on me but I'd rather have the Moto One Power with the larger batt, screen and processor. I don't get how Amazon had this but didn't even offer the One Power hence the confusion... I will provide an update after a few more days. I want my WAVE Moto gesture!! UPDATE After a few more workdays/weekend as my driver phone I have to say it's a great phone. I've had no issues with batt life. I do charge throughout day but not bc I have to. I don't think the batt has gone below 40 %. This is a much improvement over my past droids. No real buggy issues. It can get hung up a tad copy/paste shifting bw sharing options and such but nothing like my Droid did. So far I'm enjoying the phone and plan on keeping it. Perfect size, great speed and wonderful camera. I mentioned before the flashlight wasn't as bright as the Droid. I feel this was by design bc it's a more functional light and not a beam as the Droid was. It's practical and not a lumen hound. Again, I'd love to have to Moto wake gesture. As this is, you can nudge phone for same affect but it's not the same. In bed when it's dark, I miss being able to wave my hand in vicinity of phone for the display to wake. Please bring that feature back. UPDATE 3 I will be returning the phone :( I really like it but unfortunately I cannot get get steady service with T mobile or ATT. After countless hours of research and and talks with Motorola and Service providers, this phone doesn't use same bandwidths I need. Very saddening bc I liked this phone.

The camera is the big downside. 21 megapixels is just a scam to make you need more data, because the lens quality is small and poor. It takes passable social media shots but not comparable to the galaxy or iPhone quality, and don't bother to zoom. Any zoom instantly degrades the image. I switched to another camera app that allows you to choose lower photo default to save on storage and data. Otherwise I love it. I can't bear to put it in a case as its the perfect for factor and cloth back feels great. Not slippery at all. Sometimes turns off if in a pocket when sitting on a stool, but bright, beautiful, and fast. The other big downfall is the external speaker. Terrible sound quality.

(open camera, FV-5) -Splash resistance is good to know Cons? -Really wish 5+inch screens weren't the new norm, i feel the 4.7-4.9"" were ideal, larger than that = not really ideal for single hand use. -No card port -No removable battery -Doesn't make bacon pancakes. -Wife cracked her phone's screen and is a year+ from upgrade time and gives dirty looks. -Not waterproof like the competition All in all, i've really been enjoying it, and feel it's a very solid phone.

I tried the G3 for a week, and it just felt too wide. I also had a bad mic it seemed, as many callers couldn't hear me well. The s5 is like the standard, and while it had the features i was looking for, i was turned off by the incredibly cheap/chintzy chromed edge it has. Yea i know, not a huge deal, but i just didn't feel connection with the s5, i'm weird that way. Probably also didn't like that EVERYONE and their aunt has one. I didn't bother with many of the other phones because they didn't offer 4k video, which is a feature i demanded. I have good reason: I'm a videographer, and i do stock footage, so when i don't have a camera with me, and i spot something, my phone is the only thing to use. I think this phone won't sell like crazy because of the early negative reviews that slammed it on not having talk/data at the same time, which is something that's now included.

1265,B0096QYH80,paulhorn,5,22-Sep-12,False,Switched from iphone: Great decision.,"I bought this one week ago. I am not impressed with the new iphone specs (the hype was a turn off). Wanted a change. This is the first Android phone I have owned. I chose it for several reasons: 1. Better voice reception in my area (carrier issue). 2. Longer battery life than my previous iphone 3. Better connectivity with my office software. I really like this phone. It took a little extra time to set it up fully - two days. Once I had it set up, it is works like a charm. For functionality, this phone is great. For the basis needs: phone, email, tasks lists, maps, google search, voice to text, etc... it is easy and user friendly. It is also fun to use. Lot of ways to customize the functions. I do not play a lot of games, no comment there. Further pluses: 1. Looks well made and durable. Gorilla glass with Kevlar Back. 2. Size is comparable to iphone 4. Not too big, not too small. Good for the pocket. 3. Screen size is great. Bigger than iphone 4 or 5. 4. All my favorite iphone apps are on Google Play - Pulse, Zite, Evernote, Onenote. You Version. 5. The widgets are extremely functional. 6. Voicemail is better than iphone. More intuitive. 7. Audio is good. More than adequate. 8. The Motorola software add-ons seem to be useful. I don't have any experience with other handsets. 9. I like having a standard micro USB connection. The iphone cord issue is a significant bummer. My only concerns: 1. the screen is not as clear as the iphone. Not a big issue for me... I don't like reading on a small devise. 2. will I have enough memory? Probably. I don't have a ton of extraneous apps. Added a micro SD for media. Summary: I am very happy with this purchase. Great price. All the reviews that I have read are accurate and reliable. You can trust their advise. Good luck.

13948,B071VTYHDQ,Adam Cotton,1,22-Oct-17,True,Depending on what you pay.. great value,"[edit: sound problems, many other quirks with OS and phone that I hate after a few weeks with it] Buying on Amazon was a mistake; I didn't realize you could get it for $40 from ---mart and pick up locally. For $40 the phone is a great value. For $80 on Amazon, it's a good value. I expected an upgrade from my previous LG Optimus Exceed 2, and I got one. In terms of performance, anyway. But the build quality and design of the Moto is not as good. Feels cheaper and lacks a few features that even that 2013 phone had, such as tap to wake and a flashing light to alert for messages -- the Moto you have to wake it with power button to see if you have messages. Six million times a day. This causes exactly the kind of drain on attention that make phones such a life-destroying force. The LG dropped on the floor face down many times and never broke because the screen was flat and small. This Moto is made of slippery plastic and the screen has a slight curve, so it *will* drop and it *will* break if you don't get a case. The ridge where the screen meets the case is designed to collect dust - not smart. The camera seems great to me, although not as good as an iphone (even iphone 4). Overall I'm satisfied, but surprised that I miss the old phone, especially the feel of the rubberized back. You *will* drop this phone. The keyboard (the google keyboard) is much, much worse than the LG keyboard layout, so it is hard to even type a text message, but that's not Moto's bad. There have been some issues with the sound, and it did crash once or twice even though it's new and there is hardly anything on the phone. Still it's probably on par with anything you can get for this price.",1.0,Motorola,Verizon Motorola Moto E4 Prepaid Phone - Carrier Locked to Verizon Prepaid,https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Motorola-Carrier-Locked-Prepaid/dp/B071VTYHDQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qP0hy4-kL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071VTYHDQ,47,69.93,0.0

The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

26390,B07WSJYDXX,Guru,4,22-Nov-18,True,Skip the rest and BUY this affordable BYOD :),"This phone hits the sweet spot of quality vs. price. It has all the important and essential features you need and skips the stuff that isn't important from the high-end flagship phones. It works on every US carrier. You can spend more another Android phone but are unlikely to get one much better than this. If you need a phone that will work on Total Wireless, SIMPLE Mobile, Page Plus, etc. this is the phone to buy. - Very solid build quality. It doesn't feel super premium the way a Galaxy or iPhone does, but it feels high end and looks great. - The camera is much improved from the Moto G4. Practically speaking this is the biggest improvement in the phone. The camera no longer feels low-end. The new camera features like spot color work easily. The main weakness of previous MotoG phones have been addressed. - Performance is very good. No lag, everything is responsive. - Screen looks great. - The screen size is narrower than before. This is not an improvement IMO and does take a bit of an adjustment. But after a day or two, it's irrelevant. - As in the past, the Moto gestures are super handy. These are simple and immediately useful. - The fingerprint scanner and facial recognition work without a hitch. - USB-C is very nice to have, and fast charging is appreciated. A standard headphone jack is nice to have too. - Motorola continues to run a clean version of Android with only a couple Moto utilities added on. This is far better than most other manufacturers like Samsung. - The biggest negative is the back of the phone. Yes, it looks nice. But it's glass, which is pointless and a liability. And the back has curved edges that are so smooth the phone is easy to slip through your hand. Thankfully both of these things are handled but getting a case for the phone. - I read that people don't like how Motorola doesn't promise more than one updated Android version. If this is important to you, you pretty much have to spend 2 or 3 times what this device costs. This seems a minor complaint IMO. You will get a solid 18-36 months out of this phone before you start to feel ready for something new and improved.",5.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

After a little over 2 years it not only had a small crack in the screen, but also had battery issues, and the wireless signal reception had noticeably gotten worse. The 16 GB of storage had also become totally inadequate. I thought about getting a new iPhone, but I was sick of paying premium prices for a phone that would inevitably have problems and be out of date in another few years. I was also irritated by how with Apple everything is proprietary tech + more expensive, often without a clear reason or value. Chargers, cables, etc. I started researching Android phones, hoping that I could find a decent phone for a more reasonable price. I came across a lot of reviews that declared the Moto G5s Plus as the cheap phone to beat. Ive now had the phone for about 3 months and I couldn't be happier! This is an excellent phone, for a price that is less than half the cost of a top level Apple or Samsung phone--and to be honest I dont feel that I gave up anything in exchange for the lower price. The interface is very clean, without bloatware or annoying add ons. The screen is plenty bright, big, and clear. It actually has a ton of features that I think are better than my previous iPhone whether Android, hardware, or Moto specific software add ons. One example: I got the 32 GB model, and then purchased a 64 GB micro SD for storage for just about 20 bucks. I now have more storage than I know what to do with, with a minimal expense! I also like that this phone has a real headphone jack, and the charger cable is a standard micro-USB. I love how you can fast charge this phone with the included turbo charger, getting a substantial boost in relatively little time. I love the Moto-specific software add in that allows you to turn on the flash light with a quick shake of the phone! Sounds stupid, but its incredibly useful in weird moments.

20444,B07H8SBLBC,Waterboy,4,22-Mar-19,True,Why So Negative?,"My previous Motorola phone sustained a screen crack in a drop, and I was unable to text anything. It was also impossible to clone the old phone with this new phone, but the cloud backup was flawless in bringing the new phone on line. The back is pressed plastic, used a guitar pick, slid the battery into place, swapped the nano sim card into the slot, and with WiFi connected, everything was normal again within 2 hours. The turbo charger is incredibly fast. Battery life is acceptable. The phone is plastic, very light, 5.7"" overall and just what I needed. Great price for the features. Phone works only on GSM, not CDMA, so know your carrier before ordering. The finger print sensor is fantastic for picking up the phone one handed and getting the screen to open. I use a password, but hate the steps to enter it every time, but the finger sensor below the camera, disguised as the logo, is perfect as a way to bypass that. Others can use the phone if you give the password. Great for keeping the little ones off your phone. It is true about the 1GB vice 2 GB (go to Settings/system/about phone/hardware information). 16 GB of storage. Like the ability to buy another battery swap when needed by just opening the back and dropping the new one in. The cameras are excellent, front and back. Speakers are front facing. Everything a light phone user like me could want. Update: Have had the phone for a while now and still like everything about it.

26412,B07WSJYDXX,EE_DC,1,22-Mar-19,True,Poorly designed: call must be on speaker to hear person on other end & jack doesn't work.,"I purchased this in Dec. 2018 after reading several rave reviews. It's been a huge disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. The biggest problems are: 1) I can't hear anyone speak on calls unless I put the phone on speaker. 2) phone jack doesn't work. It cuts in and out randomly. I worked in an open office, so I make all calls using the phone jack and obviously can't put all my calls on speaker phone. Other small problems make it an unpleasant phone to use. It just isn't a well planned phone. I could give about ten examples, but to give you an idea...when I'm on a call, the pressure of my ear causes the phone to changes screens suddenly, an app will inadvertently open up, or the phone will mute suddenly. These issues may be caused by user error, (I should have learned to keep the phone motionless next to my ear during calls) but they shouldn't happen so easily. After using the phone for almost three months I should have worked out these kinks, but it continues to be a negative user experience.",1.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

After following the start-up instructions and 54 minute phone call with Sprint customer service, it was determined that this phone is NOT unlocked. A ""service ticket"" has been entered with Sprint to unlock the phone. It takes 48 to 72 hours for Sprint to now unlock it. So, now I have to call back after that, to go through this BS all over again to see if they have indeed unlocked the phone now. For those who care, this was my 1st attempt at buying an unlocked phone instead purchasing through my carrier, and have to say that going through all of this to save a few dollars is very discouraging for future purchases. The phone seems to perform as described via WiFi but was looking for a phone that you could actually make a phone call on.

I'm using H2O wireless (AT&T out of allentown, pa) and it works great on the international version. I was worried about this but I have had no problems at all (your mileage may differ especially if you are in an area with limited or spotty coverage). The turbo charger is AMAZING! A 20 MINUTE charge gets you to 75% quickly and I feel I can get a good 2 days of moderate usage on a full charge. It has a nice heft so it feels quality. The screen is beautiful. It's a clean build with virtually stock android... no bloatware. I love the motoGestures. To put it on 'Do not disturb', I can simply set it face down. It just works. I haven't really used the camera, but if you watched any reviews, it is a bit more than adequate if not great. So, unless you are insta-famous... this is fine. I could not be happier with this phone. I was a micro-user (on a payperminute plan) using an AMAZON FIRE PHONE (remember those?), but due to a new job with a 911 center, I needed/wanted to upgrade and a major upgrade it was for me.

I carry the phone in the same horizontal holster I've used for the D2G for years. Every time I lean forward, the flap on the holster deforms just enough to press the power button.

I'll update this review to report if any of the cases help with that problem. I'm happy with the quality of the pictures from the back-facing camera, which I use for shots of outdoor projects.

9755,B01LEL8ABY,Reviewed in Virginia,1,22-Jan-17,True,Originally good. Battery is AWFUL.,"Update (11 months in, end of October 2017) I took the phone off the charger at 100% this morning at 6:15 am. It is currently 10:30 am and the battery has died. This is a problem. I will not buy another Motorola product. I listed to 45 minutes of podcasts this morning over bluetooth, scrolled through facebook for probably a combined 25 minutes, and updated 6 apps. I am changing my rating to a 1 star (from a 3 star) as this is inexcusable on a phone that is less than a year old. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Update (7 months in, June 2017) Battery life has become a problem. I have factory reset the phone twice to temporarily improve battery life and keep only a few extra apps at a time on the phone. I dont play games or anything else on the phone. Yet, with the battery mod, the phone BARELY lasts all day. Without the battery mod it wont even make it to 5pm. The Processor has also become woefully inadequate. The phone gets really hot when trying to do pretty simple things, like open snapchat, or update 2 or 3 apps. The camera has also proven to be pretty bad. Many of my pictures turn out blurry or generally poor quality vs my old Note 4. Anymore it's definitely worth the money to get a newer, nicer phone. Or a cheaper phone that doesn't have quite as high of expectations. The Moto Z is a good phone overall, but Lenovo could do better. I'll list some pros and cons and you can decide for yourself! Original Review: Pros: Modularity: if this is something you're interested in, you can exchange the backs on the phone to different things such as a speaker, a battery pack, a projector, or a fancier camera. Most of these are in some way useful to some people. I highly recommend the battery back and the speaker. Screen quality: Beautiful screen blows many premium phones out of the water. QHD does it's thing. Build Quality: aluminum body, looks cool without any back on it at all (those gold pins though), and the Moto Mods fit very well. Software: Motorola's ""skin"" over stock Android is VERY minimal and keeps things simple, unlike Samsung who tries really hard to make Android look like their own thing and makes it bloated. Camera: The phone camera on this is great! Not quite Pixel level, but as this phone can be had for 2/3 the price of a pixel (I picked mine up for 500 flat brand new) I think it takes the cake in it's price range. Cons: Stock Speaker: The speaker on this isn't so great. It works, dont get me wrong, but it's not something to write home about. Moto Mods: As I said above, some of the Moto Mods are great, like the battery and the speaker, others are not so great. The projector's resolution and brightness are pitiful, and the Hasselblad camera mod is WORSE than the camera ON THE PHONE. WHY? Battery Life: Without the battery moto mod, the battery on this phone barely will last a day. Under heavier normal use I will barely make it to 5 pm (on time at 8 am), and under heavy use it'll make it till about 2 pm. The update to Nougat (due in February 2017) will evidently extend this life by about an hour, so that's something. However, with the battery moto mod the battery will last all day basically no matter what. If you tried to extend the battery life with the mod you could probably stretch it to 2 days if you were REALLY nice to it. Other: Processor: It's fine. Just fine. Not a real powerhouse, but for all your regular needs it does everything. It does lag a little sometimes when I don't close anything and am navigating, playing music, logging driving over bluetooth, and get out to pump gas and play a game or something. But you'll probably never notice any issues. RAM: 4 gb is fine. But again nothing ridiculous anymore. I'd recommend this phone under the condition that you also buy the battery mod to make the battery life last all day. I bought the wireless charging one because then I can charge the battery separate from the phone.",20.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

7244,B0192XJ0P6,Mesha,1,22-Feb-17,False,Don't do it!!!!,This has got to be the most horrible smart phone I have ever owned. I got mine from Verizon but thought since I'm an Amazon addict I should let my fellow amazoners know what I have gone through. It's been 1 year and I'm on my second replacement that means I'm on my 3rd droid turbo 2 in one year. My first one eventually got so slow it would take 5 min to load a web page (I timed it) even hard resetting it only helped for a few days. So they switched it out. After two months the charging port broke so I had to use a slow wireless charger.apps would constantly crash and freeze and just got unusable that was after 7months My second one was just a generic replacement none of my customizations were included. One part was sentimental but we move on. After 2 months the same thing it would take forever to load web pages. The touch screen was having problems that or it was frozen a ton. When I would restart my phone either after it died or just turning it off for work to save battery life it would take up to 16 min to fully boot. So I had it I called and got this one now. Either this will break in a month or two or the third time is a charm. It is so annoying to transfer everything over all my photos music apps ect than logging in to everything setting things up to how they used to be.

If you do not believe me Google green line on Verizon turbo 2. Everyone gets the same story. What is even more funny is that the selling point is the shatterproof screen. If you point that out they will tell you, yeah but that doesn't mean it is shockproof. Umm... excuse me but what is the point of having a shatterproof screen then. Now here is the thing though.

8457,B01DZJFWNC,Amazon Customer,5,22-Dec-16,True,"Great ""economy"" phone","This is a great phone for the money. People are very critical of this phone comparing it to others double and triple the Moto g price. This phone for me was replacing a gen 2 Moto g(which was good accept the camera). It is in every way better. The fingerprint sensor works well, no at all quirky and is fast and works every time. Screen is very good for color and detail. Processor is quick and not laggy. Battery is all day for most all people. Quick charge in this price bracket is rare but welcome. It charges really fast. Camera is very good for most situations. I will note that I mainly chose the plus model for the extra ram and laser focus camera. The camera focuses noticeably faster than the base model. Also, android is a memory pig. With all android and google software running,as well as motorolla's services this phone hovers in the 1.6 gig realm. The extra couple of gigs on the plus version is a needed cusion. Especially since these phones have android 7.0 on the horizon. I feel the extra money for the plus in the memory department and in extra storage space can expand its useable lifespan. If your a hard core gamer, think your a professional photographer, are on your phone from the time you wake till you sleep, or are looking for a race on performance benchmark tests, then this phone is most likely not for you. But, if your an average user and have reasonable expectations for what a sub $250.00 phone can provide then look no further. Fingerprint scanner, sd card slot, 64gb storage,very good camera, good screen, quick charger, good battery life, good call quality, 4 gigs of ram, and no bloatware. All very good features for an economy phone. This is a 5 star rating for me based on features vs cost.

I love how it fits my hands, which are small, and it still has a big screen - the phone is thin, nicely curved. I love the clarity of the screen. I love that it has as much RAM and internal storage as much more expensive phones, and comes with current version Android instead of earlier versions like other low-end phones. I love how fast it is. I like that it has Gorilla Glass, and that it is still very responsive to my touch. I like that I can turn it sideways to use a bigger on-screen keyboard for inputting text to to dial or message or fill online forms. It charges quickly and the battery is a lot better than the battery was on my previous non-smartphone LG slider, so I don't mind that it doesn't have a replaceable battery. I always charge phone and tablet every night anyhow, but it doesn't really always need it if I haven't played a lot of games or spent a lot of time online or made a lot of calls that day. Lasts long enough for my needs! I was going to return it because it could not be activated on PagePlus because of Verizon's rules for its service resellers, but I really couldn't find another phone anywhere as nice for the price that would work with PagePlus (which is now owned by TracPhone anyhow, no longer independent), so I decided to go direct to Verizon prepaid instead. Which is OK - they now have a prepaid plan with unlimited text & messaging where you get 1 Gb of data/month instead of 500 Mb if you use autopay - for $45, same as most other companies' prepaid programs. I use autopay anyhow so I don't forget to pay on time - they let you set up the payment date of choice. And I use it with wifi for data whenever I can, including at home, so that means lots of free streaming stuff. It's not a 4G phone, but it still seems to keep up with my needs. I do miss the ability to store stuff on a micro-SD card, but it has enough internal storage to keep lots of apps and also some pix, if you offload extra photos & videos to your pc or tablet regularly with either bluetooth or micro-USB. Also - I do not have the best hearing, but don't have a hearing aid. Call quality is good, not fabulous, but is loud enough and clear enough for me, and on speaker, sounds fine. I do have a problem with cheek-dialing (or cheek-hangup), however, but that's not the phone's fault! I'm glad I kept it. All manufacturers should take note of this phone when they think about budget phones, and upgrade their products.

14967,B074VFRKZG,CrouchingBruin,5,22-Apr-19,True,Great Phone at a Reasonable Price,"So I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind buying technology that's a couple of years old, i.e., I don't need the latest gadgets. And I can save a lot of money that way, especially when it comes to cell phones. I had purchased a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 a couple of years ago, my second Android phone (I've given up on the overpriced iPhones). The DT2 was a nice upgrade from my previous Android, a Samsung Galaxy Mini S4, with a better camera. Unfortunately, that DT2 phone didn't last too long. Started having problems with the battery draining too fast, and I got the vertical green lines that seems to plague some DT2 phones. However, I really liked the phone and was seriously thinking of buying another DT2 to replace it. I took a look at some of the other Motorola models out there, though (I like Motorola because of the Moto Actions that allow you to turn on the flashlight or the camera with a flick of the wrist, without having to unlock or turn on the screen), and found the Moto X4. Since it was less than $150, I decided to give it a try, and I'm very glad I did. Switching over the phone to my existing carrier was easy, all I had to do was move the SIM card and the 32GB memory card from my DT2 over to the new phone and I was up and running right away, didn't even have to go into Verizon. The Moto X4 is much better than the DT2, with longer battery life and a better camera. I can go a whole day on a single charge. If I charge it up to 100% before I go to bed, it's still at 96% by the time I get up the next morning. And the operating system upgrades itself, i.e., it started off with Oreo (8.0), but over the course of several days, it began installing upgrades until it's now at Pie (9.0), and all of the monthly security updates are loaded. One feature I really like is the fingerprint sensor. It is so easy, now, to unlock my phone, especially since I use my phone for work and my company requires strong security options to be selected, like long passwords. With the DT2, I had to enter an eight character password every time I wanted to unlock the screen, a real PITA. I had to also enter a PIN every time I opened up Outlook or Skype. On the Moto X4, I just press my finger or thumb on the fingerprint sensor and it opens up right away. No more entering passwords for either my phone or my apps (for the ones that support fingerprint authorization instead of a password or PIN). Even the Starbucks app allows me to use my fingerprint instead of typing a password. One thing that still trips me up is that the power and volume control buttons are backwards from the DT2, i.e., on the DT2, the power button is on top with the volume controls below it. On the Moto X4, the volume buttons are at the top and the power button below. So I find myself turning up the volume a lot of times instead of turning off the phone. The Moto X4 uses a USB-C cable instead of the more ubiquitous USB mini plug. The phone does come with a USB-C cable, but I ended up buying several extra so I would have one in my car, my bedroom, my backpack, etc. I also bought an extra charging block, and you want to make sure you buy one that supports Quick Charge 2 or 3 if you want to take advantage of the TurboPower feature (I got the Anker Quick Charge 3.0 unit). Probably the one thing I miss from the DT2 is the wireless charging. I wish Motorola would make that feature available on more of their models.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X4 Factory Unlocked Phone - 32GB - 5.2"" - Super Black - PA8S0006US",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B074VFRKZG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159JihtggL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074VFRKZG,184,261.84,0.0

1266,B0096QYH80,Eric,5,21-Sep-12,False,Great phone for beginners AND experienced users,"PROS: ICS, Ease of use, Ability to Multi-task, price, Standard Motorola Cable CONS: Average battery life (though not bad), off button location I just upgraded to this from my Droid X (which is not a bad phone, either). First of all, when I saw that this phone was $50 to $150 less than many other new smartphones on the market I thought there was a significant trade-off. Well, after about 24 hours of VERY heavy usage and research I have yet to find one other than the lack of HDMI output--which I don't use. The design is very nice and the quality of the screen is beautiful. It took a little while getting used to the new OS features and settings, but only because I was coming off an older phone with Android v. 3. I love the ability to multi-task on this, by selecting from multiple screens, and that Chrome is installed as the default browser. Also, if you have an old X or Razr, your cords will work with this phone. Some of you may have known that, I was very happy to learn it. The camera is MUCH easier to use than the one on the X. There isn't as much of a lag when snapping photos, and the quality is pretty good for a smartphone. C'mon! If you want poster quality, get a digital camera! I have bluetooth in my car and the set-up on this phone was a breeze. No complaints on call quality either. The only bad things I can say are about the battery (only slightly better than most smartphones, definitely not a deal-killer) and the location of the on/off button above the volume control. Also, there is no 'home' key for taking you back to the main home screen like X had (only a minor personal annoyance). The pre-installed ringtones are pretty terrible, but this is a non-issue as there are plenty of free alternatives on the Android market. Bottom line: A great phone for anyone looking to upgrade, or just starting out in the smartphone sphere.",150.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

18789,B07CHW5KMY,J. Chua Reyes,5,21-Nov-18,True,Careful- XT1925-2 (G6) different from XT1922-5 (G6 Play),"This model XT1925-2 32 GB is the higher priced G6 as described. More similar to US version. This is the second MotoG6 I ordered within one week and it works great. Sim slot at top. It looks like south america international version. Both Sims work same time in US (dual stand by on 3g/4g) plus a third slot for Micro SD card. There is another model international Version Moto G6 Play XT1922-5 32GB that I received (used) earlier and had to return. That one was great- also Dual sim 3g standby. But only single lens back camera, sim slot on side and Micro USB. Specs for MotoG6 Play 175 g and 4,000 mAh battery. Images show this difference. Wifi Hotspot feature important for me. I had to return the earlier XT1022-5 because Wi-Fi hotspot would not turn on in the XT1922-5 that I received. The XT1925-2 (note different last 2 numbers) that I ordered (new, 2nd MotoG6, but pricier) was better I think- had dual lens rear camera, wifi Hotspot worked, Fingerprint unlock, Face unlock, and USB C charging port. LTE icon lights up so I am assuming it goes on my ATT- LTE network. Specs for G6- Lighter by 8 grams at 167g but smaller battery 3,000 mAh Bottom line- if you are planning to order the Moto G6 international version- consider ordering the XT1925-2 ""MOTO G6"" dual rear lens, NOT the ""other"" MOTO G6 Play single rear lens one.",4.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 (32GB, 3GB RAM) Dual SIM 5.7"" 4G LTE (GSM Only) Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1925-2 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1925-2-Unlocked-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHW5KMY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RO-IMRSvL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHW5KMY,212,118.96,118.97

14963,B074VFRKZG,MurphysLaw,4,21-Jan-19,True,Nice phone but get the larger memory,"This phone is a great deal for the money. It's solidly built, the screen looks great and its fast and responsive. Moto gestures are included and they work flawlessly. I use the fingerprint sensor as a nav button but the sensor worked fine when I tried it. The standard phone doesn't have the bloatware that you commonly find on Samsung and most other phones. Its about as close to a vanilla Android phone as you can get but obviously if you buy the Amazon version, it will contain Amazon apps that can't be removed. The camera is not as bad as some reviews indicate but it's not great either. The biggest issue is photos taken in low light tend to look blurry and the camera is slow to take photos in general. The battery is great and you can go up to two days between charges if you are not watching a bunch of videos. It charges quickly with the included turbo charger. If you want a longer charge cord, make sure you get the C type or adapters. The phone has Android Oreo installed but the Android Pie system has been rolled out. Expect a lot of updates when you initially set up the phone but that is typical. Transferring contacts, data, etc from your old phone is relatively easy if you use Google. I would strongly recommend getting the 64GB phone - the operating system uses 14GB and this phone does NOT allow for adoptive storage - it uses a file encryption system which means you cannot move any apps to an SD card. You can save photos, videos and music on the SD card but keep in mind that many apps (like music players) will hold the data so it may also count against your internal memory. This phone can take a massive SD card but honestly, without the ability to save apps to the SD card, it seems rather pointless. The file-encrypted method used by the X4 seems like a step backward and in my opinion is the phone's biggest flaw. Overall, I am very happy with this phone and at this price point, you really can't find a better phone with these features. I would recommend two things - get a case as the phone is very slippery and if you have the extra cash, go for the larger memory.",10.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X4 Factory Unlocked Phone - 32GB - 5.2"" - Super Black - PA8S0006US",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B074VFRKZG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159JihtggL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074VFRKZG,184,261.84,0.0

Out of the box with the Turbo Charger it was fully charged in 15 minutes. With my conventional charger I went from 40% to 100% in 35 minutes. I did some non stop data down load and other high use tasks for a steady three hours and dropped to 40% unplugged. I took some pictures and the camera gave some good results.

269,B002WTC1NG,Mark W. Ingalls,5,21-Feb-10,False,Great VZW Phone for Active Adults,"I was in the market for a new phone, and I had the following list of desires: + Tetherable wireless modem. + Ruggedized + Uses the same USB interface as my wife's and son's phones I first ordered a different ruggedized VZW phone, because it was advertised with more features and was well reviewed. The problem was, the other brand of phone did not come with a USB cable, nor was one available. While I was searching around for the cable online, I tried out the extra features, such as the thermometer- it was off by 4 to 6 degrees Farenheit, making it pretty useless. The LED flashlight was nice, but not nicer than being able to surf the WEB surfside. So, I exchanged it for this much less glitzy Motorola Barrage. I have already used it to get my email and upload documents far from any available Wi-Fi hot spots (cool!) and it has come in handy when I am in the shower and I get an important phone call (like from my wife). It also uses the same cord as the other cell phones in the family, which is great on trips. It has some other surprisingly useful features. For example, I can make a call without looking at the phone because it pronounces the names of my contacts as I scroll through the list. Also, it is actually very useful to know who is calling without having to put down whatever I am carrying to look at the cell phone display. The voice recognition, e.g., ""Call... John... Mobile,"" actually work on this phone for me and that is a first. I already have several great digital cameras, so I always thought having a camera phone was sort of stupid. But the other day I bought something at the lumber store that didn't have a sticker. No problem, I just snapped a picture of the display tag, and the cashier keyed the SKU right in. I put one of those 4 GB micro SD cards into the phone for $11 so I can transfer files back and forth from the phone to my laptop, or to other computers. That's when one gewfy 'feature' of the phone showed up. When you first plug it in to the USB cable, you get to choose between ""Media Sync Mode"" and ""Modem Mode."" Choosing ""Media Sync"" gives you the option to either download music, or NOT. ""Not"" mode does nothing... nada... Zippo... except to charge the battery. If you want to transfer files or photos, you have to go into ""Tools"" and select ""USB Mass Storage."" But even *that* is gewfy, because there are two menu items that have the phrase 'USB'. To transfer files, you want the one that results from, ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 2. Tools, 8. USB Mass Storage,"" and *not* ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 9. USB Mode."" Pretty stinkin' ridiculous, eh? The bluetooth pairing thingie works, but I can't get used to making or answering calls on a headset. Plus, people who walk around in public talking to themselves seem icky to me. I might get a car adapter someday, and I am confident this phone will work with it. Other than that one weird menu glitch, I really, really like this phone.",61.0,Motorola,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless),https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Barrage-V860-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B002WTC1NG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81k6Nq0KI1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B002WTC1NG,352,139.99,0.0

I have now had this phone for 2 months and hate it with a passion. Let me start by saying that I have taken very good care of this phone. I purchased it new and have never once dropped it. It is in mint condition. -It over heats and it actually hurts your face/hand when it gets hot. -It's slow to do anything and the battery is short lived. -I find the screen to be too small for my liking but that's personal preference I suppose. -The home key is not a physical button so it is always getting hit accidentally. In the middle of a text? Nope! You pushed the home button so after 10 seconds of loading, you find yourself there and have to wait another 10 seconds for the text to load again. -I chose this phone because I had read good reviews about its camera but I think those reviewers worked for Motorola or were on crack... actually, probably both. I've taken better pictures and videos with my egg salad. (egg salad doesn't take pictures or videos). -I draw a lot on Snapchat (and I'm pretty decent) But not with this phone. Anytime you draw a line it comes out all squiggly. I don't know what that's about. Possibly the screen is damaged from getting too hot? Idk...

I no longer felt I was carrying a phone but instead a miniature tablet. After checking the market I see that every major phone manufacturer is making budget phones with 6-inch plus screens in 2019. I have a hard time finding small budget phones for these new releases and instead have to look at previous years releases. Performance wise it's very similar to my old G5+ when I first bought it. The camera is a little slow but I don't use it a whole lot. Overall it performs well in everyday usage. The battery life is nothing incredible, it's pretty average and considering the large size of the phone I'd say even a little disappointing. I can burn through it in a day if I want but it usually lasts me two full days. Overall I don't think I'll stick with this phone. I don't like the large size nor do I like the current trend of making the budget phones huge. I would appreciate some smaller budget options with good hardware and smart compromises.

Once it was in it took several times to unlock the phone. Absurd to put something so poorly functioning on the live market. But, by far, the worst thing about this phone is the edge to edge screen is tripped by just holding the phone. You can't hold the phone comfortably without setting off something by accident from your fingers wrapping around the edge. This makes the thing sort of undependable. They need to fix this. They could do it with a system update. I had the original Droid with the slide-out keyboard, the beautifully slim Droid that was fatter at the top with the Kevlar back (my favorite), and the razr whatever it was called, that totally crapped out on me (screen went haywire, then went dark).

4550,B00MWI4KKE,R. Justin Chan,5,21-Aug-15,False,Happy I upgraded from 1st to 2nd gen. Moto X,"I liked my first generation Moto X so much I bought a 2nd-gen model, customizing it and ordering it from Moto Maker. GOOD - I got a customized phone through Moto Maker and it is just awesome to not have a plain black or white phone. It's distinctly my phone. - The contoured back feels good in your hand, same as the old Moto X, and it gives the phone a more sophisticated shape. It's a bit more slippery than my old Moto X, though, due to the premium metal finish, but it looks nice and makes for a handsome phone overall. - The utility of Moto X's Active Display feature is still unmatched by any phone or app out there, at least that I've found. - I also still like the Moto X voice activation features, and they work better than on my old Moto. - Android Lollipop notifications on the lock screen are awesome, though I do miss the lock screen widgets for apps like Keep. - Side note: Shipping from Motorola was fast: The initial estimate was for a week on Saturday and I got the phone ahead of time on the Wednesday. EH - Battery life is good, but not great. Better now that I've set up the phone and I'm not constantly tinkering with it, though. THE COMPETITION Other phones I considered: 1. The Samsung Galaxy XS 6, which my wife has. The S6 is a solid phone with a beautiful screen, but I don't like the physical Home button. It also doesn't feel as comfy in your hand, in my opinion. 2. The Nexus 6, Google's latest flagship phone, was tempting, but when I saw it in person it was huge. Like the Moto, it has a nice curved back and a premium build, but I'm not sure I could get it out of my pocket while sitting down, which would be awkward on the bus ride to work. 3.

20867,B07HFKWDK7,suzanne morgan,1,20-Sep-19,True,Phone was an Expensive Brick,"Pros: Phone is cheaper than the G5 Plus and has better specs. Cons: 1) The charger has an international plug, which plugs into a US adapter. The attachment is so loose and the construct so top heavy that almost any movement will unplug the international plug from the adapter and fall to the floor, hopefully not taking your phone with it. 2) Far fewer choices when it comes to protective cases for this model when compared to the G5 Plus. The Problem: After the phone booted up for the first time it instructed me to download updates to the OS, which I did. After all the updates and syncing my accounts the phone worked fine for maybe 30 minutes before starting to repeatedly reboot, over and over again for no reason, before turning off. Eventually some red text appeared saying that the phone failed to boot and that I needed to connect it to my computer and use the ""Software Repair Assistant"". Went looking for the program on the company website only to find out that nothing by that name exists. Turns out that what Lenovo/Motorola actually has is a program called the ""Lenovo Smart Assistant"". Figuring out that the two were the same took far too much digging. I downloaded and installed the program and got to work using the rescue feature. Turns out that the Motorola G5S Plus isn't called that in the software, it's called the ""MOTO G Plus 5th Gen. S"" which is just the extra added tiny nuisance that a frustrated customer needs when they are desperately trying to get their new phone to work. Followed the instructions, a bunch of yellow text scrolled through my phone then a red line of text saying that boot failed, and the ""Smart Assistant"" would tell me that the software couldn't connect to my phone. Tried that over and over again until somehow my phone miraculously started working again. And for a brief 30 minutes or so I was happy, getting my settings configured and my apps organized. Until it randomly rebooted three more times in a row and then went dark. The next day I tried repeatedly to get the phone to work, or even respond to any inputs at all, nothing. It would not turn on, soft reboot, or hard reboot. The only sign of life was a little blinking light that appeared when I plugged it in to charge, and that too eventually stopped. I will be returning this brick back to Motorola and will update the review based on what happens next. Regardless, I will be losing the screen protector that I put on before I started the phone up, which is just and extra bit of annoyance to top it all off.",1.0,Motorola,Motorola Moto G5S Plus Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone (Blush Gold),https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Blush/dp/B07HFKWDK7,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41fmra6BrcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07HFKWDK7,52,129.99,0.0
18802,B07CHWMYHP,BeetleJes,3,20-Sep-18,True,Poor Audio Recording/No MHL,"I'm having issues with this phone, in the states, using T-Mobile. I've only been able to get 2G coverage, which is making phone calls choppy, and unreliable; and since wifi calling isn't available, it's pretty unusable for making calls, which is a big deal, and huge disappointment. I'm leaving 3 stars because of the fact that this phone has poor audio for recording videos, and most importantly, during phone calls. Once I turned the Dolby Audio off, the playback sound for videos was SO much better. Still extremely sensitive, and somewhat flawed, but completely acceptable, in my opinion. However, while using the phone for calls, everyone can hear me, but, they are saying it sounds like there is heavy wind blowing. Which, ironically, was my issue when I had filmed with Dolby Audio on. I'd play a video back, and it'd sound like strong wind blowing. It took hours for me, to realize it was the Dolby Audio causing the issue in videos. The Dolby Audio is not causing the audio issue during phone calls, though. I even ran a test on the microphone; when the sound played back to me, it indeed, sounded like being on a beach, or tall building, on an extremely windy day. From the information I've gathered online, I am definitely not the only one experiencing mic/audio issues with this phone. I even found an article about Motorola-Lenovo saying that they are having issues with the mic/audio on these G models, and they are trying to remedy it, but, aren't sure how long we'll have to wait for a solution. The article was from months ago, and clarified for me, that the issue is on their end. Another gripe of mine is, this device is not MHL compatible, meaning, you cannot cast/mirror this phone to another smart device, such as your TV, without buying extra garbage to plug into your TV. My old Moto X Pure Edition casted to my TVs, and Roku Stick, flawlessly. So, big disappointment with Motorola-Lenovo's choice to make that option no longer available. MHL is an industry standard. Even with the audio issue that I had with videos in the beginning, and the lack of MHL, I still loved this phone, and had decided to keep it, but, then I got a phone call where the person could hardly hear me. I thought that it was only network related. As the day progressed, as I made and received more phone calls, two of which were phone calls to T-Mobile, I realized that not only am I having network issues, I'm having mic/audio issues. There's nothing my provider, or myself, can do about that. It makes me sad because like I said, I really love this phone. The camera quality is amazing, and made me care less about how far the camera lenses stick out on the back of the phone. Odd design choice, but whatever. I bought both the G6 and G6 Plus, and as I suspected, the basic G6's camera quality is trash. For the record, my Moto X Pure that was released in 2015, takes better photos and video, than the basic G6. The G6 Plus not only takes good quality images, and video (minus the not so great audio), the single front firing speaker is really good, when compared to those stupid phones that have bottom, or backside speakers. My Moto X Pure had two, amazing, front firing speakers. The G6 Plus' speaker is not as good as my old ones, but, it's good enough, and so, I'm not complaining about it. The feel of the phone itself, is nice. The phone doesn't feel or look cheap. It has a nice weight to it. Not too heavy, not too light. The glass surround, is obviously a finger print magnet, but again, whatever. I'm going to have to return this phone because of the issues I'm having with it, and I'll end my review by saying that I'll definitely miss this phone. I really wish it would have worked out. If you're stateside, good luck with it. To everyone, I hope you don't have the same mic/audio issues that I had.",40.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 Plus - 64GB - 5.9"" FHD+, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1926-7 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Plus-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHWMYHP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511i4Qx+e2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHWMYHP,185,174.94,184.99
17391,B078RBVVCV,Tiger88,4,20-Sep-18,True,Phone is good but the camera is crap (3.5 Stars really),"After reading some other reviews I knew that the camera was getting negative reviews but the rest of the phone's capabilities and the price point led me to get it. Most of all the battery life is great. I can get two days out of a charge which I could not even get a full day from my Galaxy 7. The processing power is adequate and I don't have sluggish apps etc. Overall the phone is meeting my expectations from a performance standpoint. The camera however, is a sad feature of this phone. It has trouble focusing, the image quality is not great, in fact, its not even very good. The lens stands proud on the back of the phone and ealy get covered in fingerprints. I'm constantly having to wipe it off because it won't focus with fingerprint smudges. The fingerprint scanner on the front works better than my Samsung one did but not as good as iPhone does. It allows for registering multiple users and mulitipe fingers and that is a nice feature but I think that has more to do with Android than the hardware. The hardware though does recognize the fingerprint quickly and reliably. One, kinda creepy, thing is when you turn on the phone and the splash screen comes up a creepy womans voice says ""hello moto"", but she says it in a way that feels stalkerish. When I was doing the initial setup on it my wife was in the other room and kept hearing that when the phone restarted a few times and she hollered at me from the other room to stop doing that cause it was creeping her out.",1.0,Motorola,Motorola Moto G5S Plus XT1805 4G LTE Unlocked GSM 32GB 4GB RAm Octa Core Dual 13MP International Version No Warranty,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1805-Factory-Unlocked-International/dp/B078RBVVCV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uHmL4wC3L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078RBVVCV,56,175.0,0.0
26264,B07WSJYDXX,BeetleJes,2,20-Sep-18,False,Crappy Camera/Not MHL Compatible,"I purchased this phone from Best Buy, and the G6 Plus from Amazon. The basic G6 has the crappiest photo and video quality I've seen in years. It looks like the videos were filmed a decade ago. The G6 Plus, great video and photos. Neither the G6 or the G6 Plus, are MHL compatible. Meaning, they are not capable of a cast/mirror feature, without buying extra garbage to plug into your smart TVs. Neither would cast to my smart TVs, or Roku Stick. With my old Moto X Pure, I could hit, ""cast"", and easily connect to whatever other smart device I wanted. It's disappointing that Motorola-Lenovo would choose to remove this feature, in an attempt to force you to buy Chromecast. MHL is an industry standard. It's also disappointing that they did not release the G6 Plus model, in the states. It's a far better phone, but, it's not compatible with my network, so, I'm having to return it as well, sadly. I returned the basic G6 to Best Buy, immediately. My old Moto X Pure that was released in 2015, takes far better photos and videos than the G6. The people that are praising this phone, obviously know nothing about previous Moto devices, or they just don't care about how poor the camera is. It would be a good phone for a child, or if you're desperate, but, between the camera, lack of MHL, and the mic/audio issues that Motorola-Lenovo has admitted to having with these G models, on top of the slow update releases, this phone is a bust. Coming from an old Moto phone, you'd think their new stuff would be a slight upgrade, but, instead, total downgrade. From the information I've gathered, the Moto x4, is probably the better option, but, it's a tiny phone, and the camera isn't super great, but, it's not extremely poor quality, either. The x4 could probably get you by until you find something else. There's really nothing else that Moto has out in the states right now, in the $200-350 price range, that's worth buying IMO. Hopefully that changes, but, for now, I'm definitely jumping ship.",39.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

After repeated attempts at inputting the IEMI number I was told that the number could not be found by the Verizon network and that there was nothing Verizon could do for me. I want to be clear that I do not have a verizon account so I was walking in to the store as an new customer. Ive read through some of the reviews on this phone and others have had this issue. Those that haven't had this issue were existing verizon customers and were able to take the sim card from an old phone and put it in the new phone. I have called motorola on the issue and after going round and round the guy asked me to put in the sim card. Well it doens't have a sim card.. So I went to the Verizon store to buy a sim card and was told by verizon that the sim card would do me no good if I didn't have an account hooked to it. But I can't hook the phone to an account if the IEMI number can be read by their network. So like I said I'm pretty much ready to give up and ship it back. Has anyone that's purchased this phone been able to gain verizon services as a new customer?? The phone clearly states that it is FULLY COMPATIBLE with verizon so I'm unclear what the issue is.

In fact, it turned itself off three times during the ceremony. Some would say it's an app draining the battery but I've been using the same apps since I bought the phone. Uninstalled everything and still had the same problem with the stock apps. Some would say it's the battery, but should a battery be completely worthless after just six months of use? I haven't been able to find a replacement battery yet. Some would say it's Android 7. Could be, I didn't have any problems with the battery before updating to 7. But there's not a downgrade option and no update since 7.0. So I'm stuck with a completely unreliable phone that used to be awesome. Tried resetting the phone to factory settings to see if that would solve the issue... No change. Still dies at random, unexplainable times. Do not buy this phone.

I can say that I have barely noticed any lag at all going from application to application, the internet speed is fast, and the google voice search function is very impressive. I enjoy the interface of the phone (the three circle thing on the home screen is useful) and I found it easy to learn how to get around. It also has a cool feature whose official name I don't know. Basically it's a tiny notification light that flashes on the top left of the face of the phone. It changes color based on if you have a message/what type of message it is. I find this handy because you can tell if you have a new message without turning on the screen.

20459,B07H8SBLBC,A. H. Sudbury,5,20-Mar-19,False,Full spectrum functionality at extremely low cost,"I purchased this Motorola model from Walmart because my Samsung Galaxy S8 got smashed and was out of commission in repair for a week and a half. The version I purchased was set up on Verizon's pre-paid service and cost $59 out of pocket. I paid the required $50 to set up a month of ""pre-paid"" service in order to use the phone on my existing account, so the total cost was $109 plus tax. After using the phone for a week, I do not understand why I, or anyone else, pay $900+ for iPhones, S-whatevers, or other expensive mobile phone models. This phone is completely functional, runs the Android operating system like any other phone, and has all the features you would expect. Yes, the camera has crummy resolution and the touch screen isn't silky smooth like your iPhone. It doesn't have the flashy bonus features or ultra high resolution of your Samsung Galaxy phone. Perhaps navigating some of the settings isn't as easy. However, this phone runs all the required software, takes workable photos, connects to the 4G network just fine, connects to Bluetooth devices, and does any other FUNCTIONAL task you might need on a day to day basis. The main difference is that this Motorola Moto E5 Play phone is 1/10 the cost of the most recent iPhone or Galaxy smartphone. For these reasons, the phone deserves five stars just based purely on the value. I recommend considering this phone over top brands for anyone where cost is a concern.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto E5 Play XT1920-19 Factory Unlocked 16GB Dual SIM 1GB RAM 4G LTE 5.3"" LCD Display 8MP International Version (Black)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Fingerprint-Sensor-XT1920-19/dp/B07H8SBLBC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VVNfdleQL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07H8SBLBC,117,89.99,159.99

I normally juice it a little in my car on the way home, hut that's about 15 mins worth of charge. It does take a while to charge from empty as the battery is so big. Processing speed is good for daily use. Facebook, Snapchat, messenger, all work well. Video recording in Snapchat is a little slow, but plays fine. **I do not play games on this phone** But would not recommend for a gamer phone as I feel it would be sluggish with intensive games. Streaming video is excellent. As is the front facing camera. This phone was built for selfies. 6 months in, updates to apps has slowed it down just a bit, nothing to get bent out of shape over. Battery life is still PHENOMENAL!! I did buy a case to protect it, but at this price I will keep it a year and get another newer one. No cracks on the screen or scratch's to date. Phone is a little on the heavy side, but to me that communicates ""well made."" Very happy with this phone and will be buying the newer version in another 6 months or so.

The G7 was functional, however I did experience some lag with apps and notifications didn’t seem to work correctly. There would be times that I would have a Facebook message and the message would show on my lock screen as it should. Then there would be other times when it wouldn’t show and only the small blue notification dot on the app icon would appear once unlocking. Another major problem for me was the Bluetooth. I use my phone to listen to music in my car and make calls frequently. I would get small, microsecond interruptions multiple times during nearly every song that would play. I know that an interruption here and there is normal, but this was excessive. The same would happen with phone calls. One other quirk was that I had set up the Talk To Me feature for Moto so that I could use the phone hands free in the car. I would get the notification after getting out of my car and turning it off that the service was on since I was driving. So it just wasn’t displaying at the right times.

9791,B01LEL8ABY,Isaac Martinez,5,20-Jun-18,False,Best android phone? Maybe.,"This is a really really good phone. I had a Galaxy S8+, traded it in at Best Buy and got this (for a ridiculously low price) with the new JBL Soundboost 2 mod. So far I have zero regrets. It's super slim, but I never use my phones without a case, so I just use the wood looking style shell it comes with and a bumper case. It does end up feeling normal size when you use a style shell, though I will say that thinness doesn't matter to me much unless it's too thick. This is great with or without a style shell. Obviously big mods will make it super thick. It's super smooth, and very fast. Anything I do with this thing is super fluid and lag-free. I don't know how the carrier versions differ (if at all) with the bloatware iinstalled, but the unlocked phone is super fast. The screen is very nice, very sharp, and plenty bright. I don't live on a coast getting sun from 4 AM to 8 PM. so I really don't deal with it in the sun much, but it's about as readable as any other phone in the sun. Speaker is pretty alright. Nothing too special, though few phones have a speaker worth writing home about. I mean, it IS front facing, so that's really nice. Now one thing that really matters to me are cameras. I take lots of pictures of many things, including my family, cars, and some nature stuff. So far, the camera has been pretty great. Lots of contrast when I want it, not a lot when I don't. Though I only use auto, I'm not camera savvy enough to change things like ISO and white balance. Not a selfie guy at all, so Iliterally haven't used it once. It's 5MP and has a flash. A flash! Who has those??? Motorola does, that's who! So hopefully no crappy night selgies with this thing. And of course, the mods. Currently, I only have the Soundboost 2 mod. But I gotta say, WOW. I cannot tell you how nice it is to be able to just slap things on the back of my phone to drastcially change things. No need for a bluetooth speaker, Gear 360, mirrorless camera, bluetooth controller, portable batter, portable projector, and photo printer in your bag. Just use the moto mods for all that, and it just works. No pairing, no fuss. I am absolutely going to get more mods and a carry case for them. It's the reason to get these phones, it's absolute convenience. ""But it doesn't have a headphone jack!"" Bro it's 2018, just get wireless headphones. I personally pre-ordered the Ticpods Free, from Mobvoi. Just get some cool Bluetooth headphones and you're good. ""But it has bezels!"" Dude, who cares? In 2027 maybe bezels will be unforgiveable, but come on. It's still very comfortable to hold and use. Don't whine. In conclusion, it's an amazing phone and the mods are the best accessory. I am probably just going to stick with the Moto Z family for the forseeable future.

22825,B07NPRQYP1,Amazon Customer,5,20-Jul-19,True,Great battery life and great value!,"I bought my Moto G7 Power about a month or two ago, skeptical about it since I had a horrible experience with my last Moto phone. I knew I needed a new phone though, but didn't want to spend my rent money on one, so went ahead and paid for the value product advertised here. Well, so far I love my new phone! The battery life really is phenomenal, though it's not the three days like it advertised. I'd say it's probably two, but that could be because I like to watch a lot of videos on my phone and use other apps that eat my phone's battery life. It's still great though, and I like not having to carry my charger with me everywhere.

Every review that I've read about this phone is actually underwhelming. Don't let the word ""budget"" fool you. This is an incredible device. The camera is almost up to par with my wife's Google Pixel 2. 720p resolution on a bright LCD screen is still really beautiful and clear. The Snapdragon processor is definitely up to par with the Google Pixel 2. I imagine Thomas will only hey better with this device once the Android Pie update becomes available. The only downside that I really see with this device is that it's a bit more difficult to find accessories that actually are a good value (screen protectors, cases, be etc.) when compared to a flagship like the Pixel 2 or any Galaxy S phone.

4593,B00MWI4KKE,Dan O,5,20-Jul-15,True,it looks good. In my case,"I bought this phone late in the game, not long before this year's (2015) iteration will launch, so will skip the overview of all the specs and how it stacks up against its competitors and all that ""I wish I was a tech journalist"" nonsense. I wasn't shopping this phone against its competitors, but its predecessor, the original 2013 release of the Moto X, and several other phones in the $200ish range. I bought it at 229 USD, just 30 more than I could have bought its predecessor as new old stock, but lightly used. It has impressed me so far. I've used a few android devices, including a smartphone (Motorola Droid Razr Maxx 'can we add any more names to this thing?') that I used without a SIM, essentially as a miniature tablet for wifi use with a Motorola Tundra as my talk/text device until the Tundra finally died. So, since it's about to be outdated, why don't we look at this phone in detail, but without the ""brand new shiny thing"" glasses of release day, and from the perspective of someone who has used, but not relied upon, smartphones for some time. First, it looks good. In my case, with a white front and bamboo back, I like it, even if I'm not a fan of white on phones, I don't care, my phone's made of g****** bamboo. That's awesome. When you ask for things to happen, they happen. This applies to general performance with touch interaction as well as voice, motion, etc. Without the task bar of a PC, I lose track of all the things running, but I've been shocked when I remember to check on this phone. It runs all of your favorite boring things like Facebook, your bank's app, 11 tabs of different lemon cake recipes, parts searches for a 1996 geo tracker, a 2003 Honda Element, and how to trim your micro SD card into a Nano SD card at the same time while playing music. Durability? As soon as I have the money after this purchase (yes, I'm broke. who else buys year-old phones off-contract to use on Consumer Cellular? yeah, the elderly. Are they writing long reviews on Amazon? No, they are not. Moving on). Anyway, as soon as I have the money, I'll be getting an Otterbox Defender case for this. I love the bamboo, and I ordered a somewhat protective case with a frosted transparent back for it at the same time as the phone, but I kill phones, and this one does not feed especially durable. Not that I expect it to. It's a big ol' ball of performance and fashion statement in a phone, and there's no room there for ""what if it falls of my pocket from a gaoddamn tractor?"". That's why I will, but haven't yet, dropped the cash on a good case. What else do you want to know? It's quick, it works, it's getting cheaper as the new version gets closer, but it's still a great phone and if you really want to pay retail prices you can still get it customized. Just think, you could have the very last custom 2014 version Motorola Moto X. Or you could, like me, get the best used one you can find and pretend it's exactly the way you want it. White front, bamboo back FTW. Anyway, it really is a good device.

7309,B0192XJ0P6,Hummingbirds,5,20-Feb-16,False,I am totally in love with this phone!!!,"Since my Samsung Galaxy S5 had the screen flaking out a lot, I had intentions of upgrading it to the newer S6 -- UNTIL I checked out this Motorola XT 1585 Turbo 2 at the mall and ended up buying it instead! There was just no comparison, in my opinion! For me, having all my music, photos, documents, and backups on my 64GB SD card is imperative. It's SO much easier to port to a new phone that way, saves cloud storage (especially if you're on a limited data plan), and also saves internal phone storage space. So when I found out the S6 did not have an SD card slot, and the Motorola Turbo 2 does, that pretty much decided it for me. Also, the camera on the Turbo 2 is much better than most phones. 21 megapixels!!! It takes awesome photos and video, with no lag time (my S5 was very laggy in this department). The processor speed is excellent, and with over 50 apps loaded now, there is no lag, apps open quickly and run smoothly. Music actually sounds better on this phone than on my old S5. The size is just slightly larger than the S5, but it still fits nicely in my hand (and my hands are not large). It is a little smaller than my husband's Galaxy Note 2. As far as the aesthetics, I love the white color with the metal edging. It looks very sleek and classy. For the size it is pretty lightweight, and fits well in my pocket or purse. Because the multi-layer screen is shatterproof (woohoo!!!), I did not feel the need to put a screen protector on it. The screen cleans very easily and does not get as smudged up as other phones I've had (either with or without screen protectors). The screen is also very bright outside, and can easily be seen on a sunny day -- even better than I used to be able to see my old S5! Also the resolution is awesome. The only thing I see lacking with this phone is no small flashing LED light for message notifications (but then iphones don't have that either, and people get used to it, so I suppose I could live with it). I only have a thin TPU gel case on it to protect the outside, and because even with the rubbery back, it could slip out of your hands since the sides are a smooth metal. The battery life for the first few days ran out quickly, but as is typical, it stabilized in the first week of breaking it in, and now goes a lonnnnnngggg way! My kids have to charge their iphones 4 times a day, and my Turbo 2 runs all day on a single charge! I charge it on a dock overnight (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Multimedia-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B009QW3TBK/ref=pd_sim_sbs_107_6?ie=UTF8&dpID=31DAuwlwVwL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=04P8GFGN8K0BMXZ9MN2F), and use it as a nightstand clock.

1354,B0096QYH80,Eric Lobdell,5,20-Feb-13,False,Perfect size and very well made,"I've become a Motorola fan by accident. My first Android phone was a Motorola Droid (original, with slide-out keyboard), then a Droid X, then a Droid X2. It was time for an upgrade and I was all but convinced that I wanted a Galaxy S3. Motorola had been great, but I'm sure the GS3 is a great phone too. But when I went to look at them in person, I discovered just how huge the GS3 is. I'm a guy who likes to carry his phone in a front pants pocket most of the time. There were times when the Droid X2 felt huge in my pocket, so I was worried about having something even larger, but wanted the performance and quality. What's a guy to do? The guy at the kiosk (in Costco) asked if I had heard of the Droid Razr M. ""No,"" says I, ""what's that?"" The rest is history. A phone with the same size and quality screen as my Droid X2 that is overall somehow smaller in every dimension, lighter, and has way more battery life? Sold. I purchased it late December 2012. Though I wanted black, only white was available so I got that. It has grown on me. The finish is actually a little opalescent and appears to be durable. I never use a case and two months in there are no signs of wear. People have said the back is ugly/busy but my phone isn't a fashion statement. Functionally of that grippy Kevlar back is awesome and it feels great in my hand. Another reviewer here made a good observation--there's a point at which a phone is simply too big to be a one-hander. If you don't want to use both hands, the RAZR M is perfectly sized and easy to hold onto. It is the best Motorola phone I've had. That's partly due to the awesomeness of Android Jelly Bean, which really feels like what the OS has always aspired to be. But battery life is quite good, build quality excellent, no issues with call quality or reception, wifi is reliable, and I think I only shut down the phone once in the first two months I owned it. Prior Android phones required occasional reboots to keep them happy. PROS - All that stuff above. I repeat: smaller, lighter, faster, significantly longer battery life, Jelly Bean. Plus expandable memory via micro-SD. Camera is quick to start and takes decent photos. NFC, although I haven't used it yet. Front-facing camera. Less bloatware than most Verizon phones. And it is ""splash resistant"" too - having lost my beloved first Droid in a tragic accident involving a really small water exposure (wet hands) I appreciate this phone being a little tighter in that regard. CONS - Some have said that the inability to move apps to memory card is an issue. I didn't know about that until I read reviews here AFTER I purchased. For me, this has not been an issue. I have a fair number of apps and still plenty of room. Do your research though. No HDMI out, if that matters. I had that on my Droid X and X2 and used it about three times. I don't miss it. Some have said screen resolution is inferior on this phone. The screen quality is very good, but resolution isn't as good as the GS3 or an iPhone. I only think this would really be an issue if you were going *down* from something better (unlikely) or you frequently use another phone with better resolution. That said, the Costco kiosk guy has two personal phones, this one and a GS3, and he said he doesn't notice it much. But if you want the very best possible screen to compete with iPhone, take a close look before choosing this model. Not a con per se, but the battery cannot be removed or accessed. I've had no reason to do that yet so hopefully it's not a concern, but I wanted to mention it. My wife is due for an upgrade and she wants a Razr M too after seeing mine. I'd recommend this phone as a candidate for anyone looking for an Android, or an iPhone for that matter.",3.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

18326,B07C2VFMN2,Aaron L,4,20-Dec-18,True,Solid Phone,"I've had this for a month or two and like it quite a bit. The included battery pack is a huge convenience, with it attached the battery can easily last two full days of medium-heavy use. Easily the best battery life of any smartphone that I've owned. Screen is large and looks good. Camera is fine, nothing exceptional, but not bad either. Minimal bloatware preinstalled. No issues switching over my Verizon SIM card. Two minor complaints - the phone does sometime freeze up when using apps, and I will need to wait a minute or two for them to catch back up before I can do anything. Some performance issues are to be expected from a mid-range phone, and it doesn't happen often enough to be a huge issue, but it is kind of annoying. Secondly, it doesn't seem like Motorola is really making cases that are designed for use with the battery pack. This made sense for the Z2 Play when the battery pack was an optional accessory, sold separately. But now that they're bundling the battery pack with the Z3 Play, I think that they should realize that a lot of their customers will be using the battery pack at all times, and design cases accordingly. I didn't want to constantly be taking the battery and cases on and off, so I had to settle for a $15 ""bumper case"", which is really just a plastic ring that goes around the edge of the phone. It seems to give some protection, but it'd be nice if I could use a true case with the battery pack. Complaints aside, I would buy this phone again and would recommend it to others. If you're not a complete power user that has to have the absolute cutting edge phone, this phone is probably plenty powerful for you, and you'll save a lot of money compared to the latest Galaxy/iPhone.

4827,B00NO2WXM4,Hotspur,4,20-Dec-14,False,Has this phone been Google's vision all along? A great product.,"I've only had it for a couple of days now, but WOW, I'm really enjoying this phone. In physical dimensions the phone is virtually identical to my old GS3, but the screen is much larger. It is a nice piece of kit, for sure. The hardware is excellent. I'm not a major camera user, so that shortcoming doesn't particularly apply. The new Lollipop update is AMAZING. Apple will surely be looking at this new version of Android with a nervous feeling. The jankiness of Android that has always been apparent and which we've all grown used to has been removed, making for a slippery smooth OS that is very beautiful and responsive. It's like they completely rebuilt Android from the ground up! But enough about Lollipop, this is a phone review. It is a great phone. Most of the crap has been cleaned out of this phone, so the OS is very stripped down and close to stock, even if Verizon still has to shoehorn a couple of unnecessary apps into it. The look and feel is fantastic. It is a solid piece of hardware, but very understated. The display is beautiful and I can't stress enough how amazing the ""attentive display"" is, using the AMOLED screen. This has been the thing that I love the most, as the phone senses your presence or your hand, and automatically lights the screen up into a sort of standby mode. When you pick it up, it's ready to go; you don't have to push a button just to wake the phone into the lock-screen. But here's the kicker: The AMOLED screen only lights up the pixels that it needs. The black pixels are exactly that, completely black, not that back-lit black that still completely floods your bedroom with light and blinds you when you reach for your phone in the middle of the night to see what time it is. I already feel spoiled, and sometimes it feels like I'm using a piece of tech from the future, like when have my phone sitting in front of me on my desk at work, and I look straight down at it, and the ""attentive display"" sees my face, wakes up, and shows just the time on a completely black background. It just feels very natural, like this phone is the vision of Android that Google has had all along, and that they've been working towards this device. Ok, as for the downsides. The battery isn't huge. Out of the box, it's just right, but over the next year or two as apps become more ever more intensive and demanding with the battery - and as my phone gets some age on it - I could see myself struggling to get through the day a year or two from now. To that extent, it's extremely disappointing that the battery isn't removable. When the day comes that I'm having a hard time getting through the day, I'd love the ability to quickly swap out for a new battery, but sadly that doesn't seem possible. Also, it is incredibly disappointing that the phone doesn't offer an sd-card slot. In addition, while this phone is no phablet, the actual display might still be too large for some.",4.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X - 2nd Generation, Black Resin 16GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00NO2WXM4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UpiOZp47L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00NO2WXM4,124,0.0,0.0

26215,B07WSJYDXX,Eric C.,2,20-Aug-19,True,Motorola does not prioritize security,"I am not happy to write a negative review of any kind, especially for Motorola. My favorite phone of all time was a Razr, after all. I do not need a very expensive or fancy smartphone--just the basics and an ability to connect with my company network. That made the g6 seemingly perfect. The phone started out fine (and is still fine for basic features, speed, battery, camera, etc. so 2 stars rather than 1). Yet it has since become a major liability for my job because Motorola does not assure regular Android security patch updates. As of this writing, Motorola only makes the May 2019 patch available and the public latest for Android is August. That is three whole months out of sync and my company has now thrown me off of their network for compliance violation. But really, really frustrating is that Motorola support will not commit to any roadmap dates. How long will I have to wait to get my email and VPN back? Motorola refuses to answer. I can understand not wanting to go through all of the regression testing for minor bug fixes or new features of general OS updates. However, these monthly Android security patches are a different matter. Some security updates deal with obscure, low-impact risks, to be sure. But, regardless of absolute risk, every Android-based phone vendor in 2019 must demonstrate a commitment to security diligence by at least publishing a response to each and every official Android security patch with either a firm delivery date or a justification for skipping the patch and rolling it into the next. Never should they skip more than one month, regardless of impact. It is just an indication of profits over their customers' security. I give them another week and then I need to make a tough decision of possibly ditching this phone and Motorola forever. In short, think twice about this phone or Motorola I general if you want to use it for work and your company has tight governance controls. If you buy your phone directly from your carrier then perhaps you will have better luck (or at least someone else to complain to).",3.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

And it looks great, feels great.","I'm not really a phone reviewer, I just wanted to clear something up that I saw in another review. This model does work with U.S. Republic Wireless service even though (a) Republic currently asks that you verify it's the ""North America"" unlocked version, and (b) out of the box, the Republic app says it's an unsupported device. I panicked when the Republic Wireless app told me it was unsupported, but after installing some system updates everything resolved itself and I'm now on Republic's network. As for the phone, I love it so far. Battery is the best I've had, though (not surprisingly) if I use it a lot I don't get 2 full days out of it. I was worried about the bulk of the phone since it's the fattest in the Z lineup, but it seems very slim to me and it feels fine in my pocket even with a silicone case or the cheap, thin battery mod on it. It's about the same as my old S6, but it feels slimmer because of the larger screen. It's my first non-flagship non-premium phone, and it makes me wonder why I used to always buy those. New tech takes a long time before it's integrated well enough to change the way you use your phone and flagship phones always sacrifice practical features like great battery life, reasonable cost, (now) headphone jacks, etc. in order to pack in features that are useful for marketing rather than for actual users.",12.0,Motorola,"Motorola MOTO Z PLAY (XT1635) Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen - 32GB - Black (International Version - No Warranty)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1635-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B01MDMJGYT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YWHpWk7+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MDMJGYT,161,169.0,0.0

I am at the point where I have to carry a power bank with me at all times because it will shut off at any charge level. I do think it's funny that it started after the 8.0 update (about the same time as many other complaints) and around the same time as the Z3 was released 🤔. I'm waiting on a response from Motorola but not holding my breath. It is blatantly obvious that there is a widespread problem, Be it a bad batch of batteries, software issues... Or maybe something more nefarious? I'm purely speculating but the timing is very suspect. I was planning on getting the Z3 eventually as I have moto mods but this situation has put a bad taste in my mouth. I don't have Verizon so I have to pay full price if I were to get it.

Some days are 4+ hours of screen time and other days I struggle to get 2 hours being in the same place with the same signal. The camera is just bad.

Bright and crisp AMOLED that is just a joy to use. Stock Android with a few light touches that are welcome. The notification light up on the screen is great and doesn't require turning the whole screen on to see what is happening.

14560,B072ZWCKP5,CheshireCat,4,2-Nov-17,True,Snappy performance at decent price.,"Have never used Prime One day delivery. Estimated delivery time was 8 pm. Came at 2 pm! This is only day 2. But E4+ has mostly met my expectations. It handles smoothly with a lot of pages open. (Google Earth and a dozen pages was the exception.) Loaded most of my favorite apps. Hooked up Google. Facebook will be next. I was excited about the fingerprint scanner. On the first day, worked perfectly. Next morning not so happy. It wouldn't recognize my fingerprint. 😨 Quick internet search later, cleared my cache and back in business. But fp scanner is off until I do a little research on this evidently not uncommon occurrence. Because this is the first phone that I have had that has a fingerprint scanner, this isn't a problem. However, that's the 1star off 😕 on my review, because I was excited🎇 by the idea. I have set up the Moto motions using the scanner. I really like them.I like reclaiming the screen real estate from the Back, Home and Windows buttons. The battery seems as good as stated. I have an app that tracks actual usage. 6 1/2 hours of moderate on screen use and 15 + hours time with 40 % battery left this morning. No gaming or movie viewing yet. With 720p and 2Gb RAM will spend some time after my basics are setup seeing what the limits are. Google Earth initially seemed a bit jerky. Then I realized I had 12 other windows open. Shut them. Google Earth was smooth. That's the limitation of 2Gb of RAM. The European E4+ has 3 Gb for it's base RAM. Looked into getting the European version, but ran out of time when my current phone died. That's all for now. Will come back in a few weeks- maybe just before Thanksgiving for a an update. All in all I am satisfied with the performance at this point. Update 11-24-17 Decided not to use the fingerprint scanner. Seems to be an ongoing problem. Moto help seems to have only one answer: soft reset, hard reset, factory reset and send back for service. This is an opinion, but it seems that after the factory reset the idea is that you add apps back one ar a time to see if one of the apps is causing a problem. I was excited by getting a fp scanner but I don't miss what I have not had up to now. So the one point stays off. 😤 Unfortunately, a second problem has shown up. The screen is infrequently unresponsive to to touch. At first I thought it was related to the glass screen protector, but it seems to only occur when I have a Google search open and I click on the hyper link to open a new page. I have to touch 3 or 4 times. Then I may end up on a blank page. Next time it happens I will take a screenshots to add to this review. I am unable to replicate the problem reliably. I close all windows. Do cache clean and the problem seems to go away for a while. Debating whether to take another star off. It seems to occur when I push the phone hard. Lots of windows, adding and uninstalling apps. Lots of Utube viewing. I may be pushing beyond the more limited software of 2 gb of RAM. In spite of this, I am enjoying this phone. The battery life is all it's supposed to be. For what I paid I am satisfied so far ( even with the intermittent touch problem). I will follow up one more time in 4 to 6 weeks on over all preformance and the touch problem.",12.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0
4570,B00MWI4KKE,J. Schaffer,4,2-Nov-17,True,New old stock (possibly refurbished?),"Because this phone came out 3 years ago and there are many reviews already written about it, I'm going to limit the scope of my review to how this ""old inventory"" phone met my expectations. Background: I've actually had this exact model phone since 2014 soon after it first came out, and I still use it daily. It works great, but the battery is past is useful life. The phone shuts off when the battery gets to about 40%, and it gets there quick. So I've been looking for a new phone, but refuse to spend over $200 for something that I could lose, drop in the toilet, etc. I just need a phone that's fast enough for typical daily use. My search led me back to the Moto X2, which for $50-100 cheaper here than any modern budget phone (i.e. Moto G5) seemed like a good deal. I was unsure what state this would be received in since it's been in a box for 3+ years. I ordered one being ""shipped and sold by Amazon"". I've only had it a day now, but first impressions are positive. The box was not shrink wrapped, which made me suspect if this is a refurbished phone. Also, the black phone came with a white charger and cable. When I ordered my new one 3 years ago, the black phones came with black accessories, and white with white. Also, while the phone exterior looked clean, there was a little paint scuffing inside the charger port. (Not being picky here, just trying to discern if this is really a ""New"" phone as advertised, or is actually ""Refurbished"".) The phone came branded with the AT&T Logo, and is XT1097 as advertised. So it will not get Android updates beyond 5.1 Lollipop. (Honestly that may be a good thing, as my wife's Moto G3 and subsequent Asus Zenfone Laser 3 both got significantly slower with the Android updates pushed to them.) Time will tell how the battery performs on this new-old phone. Will the 3 years of storage have been bad for its ability to hold a charge?

3507,B00HPP3QD6,Gail LV06,5,2-Jul-14,True,Quite Impressive - UPDATE New Update: No Complaints,"Upgraded from 4 stars to 5 because (1) I've had the phone long enough to give a review based on more exposure; (2) I fixed my perceived problem with data limits that prevented downloading most apps & updates. I was still getting ""Insufficient Memory"" (or something similar) messages, even for attempted updates. That's no longer the case. Once I figured out how to remove the roughly 700 songs migrated from my old Samsung Galaxy phone, which had unlimited data plan, I was able to easily get updates and add new apps with no problem. It wasn't a Moto G defect that was preventing my removing the songs. It was a faulty USB connection from my computer to the phone. Once I changed USB cable, my computer recognized the phone, and managing songs and playlists was easy. Now I have enough data/memory to get the apps I want, but not so much available that I indiscriminately download a bunch of stuff I'll never use. I don't play games, watch movies, do social networking, or any other data-hogging activity. I'm into productivity, retail sale notices, coupons and such, so this Verizon Moto G $45/mo plan is perfect for me. ORIGINAL REVIEW (Revised) ************************************** Just emerged from two years of Sprint cell hell. All that $ for the Samsung Galaxy Epic Touch, only to end up with something barely functional because of Sprint's pitifully poor service and ludicrously limited reception. It wasn't a matter of whether a call would drop, it was a matter of when--IF the call went through in the first place. Now I'm back to Verizon with its superior coverage and wonderful Moto G. It's intuitive and has easy-to-access, easy-to-follow instructions. Even provides some on-screen demos. I've cut my cell phone bill by more than half with Verizon's no-contract $45/month plan and now have the best phone I've ever had. Good-looking, sleek front, and a nice rubberized (but not cheap-looking) back that makes it easy to hold on to. Unlike Sprint Galaxy, it responds quickly and efficiently to tactile and voice commands. Highly reliable with excellent battery life. I had to charge my Galaxy every night and often mid-day as well. I charge my Moto G only about every 3 days. Very easy to operate. If you've owned a Smart Phone, you'll know instinctively how to perform virtually every function on the Moto G. If you're new to Smart Phones, this is a nice model to start with. BONUS: It was extremely easy to transfer my phone number, contacts and some apps from my Samsung Galaxy by using the Motorola Migrate app. I most certainly do recommend this phone for the budget-conscious person seeking dependable phone service first, frills second, or anyone wanting a Smart Phone that's efficient and easy to learn (I'd had to buy a how-to book for my Galaxy).",9.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

Very annoying. I eventually went to apps reset and this seems to have taken care of 75% of the ads. The only real problem I see with this phone Is the low volume of the speaker. I've tried different volume boosters which just seem to make the issue worse. I miss a lot of calls because I just don't hear it ringing. Yes phone looks good but with the low volume I can only give it 3 stars,1.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

I wanted a new phone with my current carrier but didn't want to purchase one from them for several hundred dollars and be locked into a two-year contract. When I received it, all I had to do was take it to one of their locations and they installed a new SIM card free of charge and transferred all data onto the new phone.

8460,B01DZJFWWS,Robin Davis,1,2-Jan-17,True,*updated 3/15/17* Don't buy this phone.,"*UPDATED* 3/15/2017 ""Great phone for non power users"" That was my initial review title. I was W-R-O-N-G! I have changed my review from 5 stars to 1. That's right Moto Agents. I just took away 4 stars. It was fine and I had no issues for several months. I purchased 2 of these in October 2016. Both phones are now having the ""jumping screens"". The white one more so than the black one, but both are doing it. I use the white phone. I have done every reset/format under the sun thinking it had to be related to an app I downloaded. It's not. I've read that it does it when you try to use the phone while it's charging. That's true! It does! But it also does it at any other given point in the day. What I have tied it to is swiping the lock screen ""too fast"" which is ridiculous, but it happens almost every time I swipe it fast. If I slowly drag it, it doesn't. At any rate, I have found that you can stop it once it starts, by hitting the power button to black out the screen, then hit the power button again and slowly unlock the screen (I do not have a passcode on mine). Then I can hit the square button and close all the windows of all the crap that opened up on it's own. Much easier than trying to tap things closed while they're jumping all over the place. I will be replacing these phones and going back to Samsung. Not at all happy with these phones. I picked up 2 of these (1 black, 1 white) for my husband and I after his finished off his Samsung Galaxy 5 Active (which was WAY less sturdy than the Galaxy S3). We moved to a pre-paid carrier and I wanted decent phones that didn't cost $700 and didn't add to my monthly cost. I previously had a Blu Studio Energy which has AMAZING battery life, but next to nothing for internal memory and after a year I was over fighting with it just to update an app. I read a lot of reviews and ended up choosing the Moto G4 for our current phones. It's been about 6 months since we got them and I have no real complaints. Minor issue - the camera isn't that great. The phones are actually not as good as what I got on the Blu Energy and it was a lower megapixel. Really it's only an issue with anything at a distance. Anything up close is good, even lower light photos. Typically I have my DSLR when i'm taking most distance photos so it's not a deal killer for me or my husband.",9.0,Motorola,Moto G (4th Gen.)

9738,B01LEL8ABY,R. Morgan,5,2-Dec-16,True,Great new phone to replace my aging Note 4,"After a day using the phone, I am very pleased. Battery life is good for a day of heavy use. Screen is AMAZINGLY crisp and bright. Camera is good. Call quality, as reported by folks I was talking to, is also very good/excellent. I like the Moto actions (chop-chop to turn on flashlight, twist-twist to activate camera, even when screen is locked), but I am not a fan of the Google Now launcher, so I installed the Arrow launcher, and that is a big improvement. I wish the phone had heartbeat sensor like my Note 4 did, and I do miss the multiple apps on the screen that the Note had, but the thin, light nature of this phone certainly makes up for it. Gaming performance is flawless for everything I have tried so far. I will likely end up replacing the stock camera app as it's pretty basic. But that's the advantage of almost pure stock Android, I get to choose what I want, and I don't have a bunch of junk I don't use hanging around unable to be removed. The magnet holding the backplate on is very secure, but I have not had any issues removing it. The phone also came with a plastic bumper to protect the edges, but with that on, you can't access the SIM/SD card tray. (Phone uses nano-SIM, so I had to get a new one as the Note 4 uses a larger card) I don't expect to need to go into that often once I get a new SD card, so that's not a big problem, but it's a bit annoying. Another ergonomic thing I have to get used to is the placement of the side buttons for power and volume. On my Note 4 the power button was on one side and the volume buttons on the other, but on the Moto Z they are all on the same side, with the power BELOW the volume buttons, which seems counter-intuitive. The lack of the S-Pen won't affect me much, as I rarely ended up using that as it was. Same goes for the headphone jack. I haven't used a wired headset in over a year. The Moto Z does come with a small adapter cable to allow you to convert the USB 3.1c port to a 1/8"" RCA jack, if you need one. Data speeds are as expected, using AT&T's LTE. WiFi uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, Bluetooth and NFC both work well, as evidenced by the connection initiated during initial configuration. I used the Google setup tool to copy settings from my Note 4 and all it took was a bump of the two devices.

14917,B074VFRKZG,JP,4,2-Apr-19,True,A few quirks but still worth the money,"The phone on general has worked well for me. This phone has a design flaw that I didn't understand before I purchased it. Motorola has an ascending volume. This means that when the phone rings the first and second rings are lower in volume than the third and following rings. If I have the phone in my pocket I will feel it vibrate twice before the ringer is loud enough for me to hear it. I'm use to give rings before voice mail but now I may only hear three rings. I adapt and make do with it. The big problem is when you get a text message or any other beep alert. The ascending volume also applies to those alerts. It's insane that Motorola wouldn't offer a way to turn off the ascending volume. I will end up rooting mine and seeing of there's a way to take care of the volume flaw. The phone runs good and with decent speed on pie. When I received it, it was on Oreo. It ran awesome on Oreo and once again after its rooted I'll drop back down to Oreo. I'm not one of those people who can't stop tweaking their phone. I had a Samsung s7 on android 4 and was happy with it. As long as I can get email, texts, doing directions and make calls, I'm good. Cases can sometimes be difficult to find that fit well. There are two versions of this moto. This however is the latest version. Also, pay the extra money and get the non amazon version....

3320,B00HPP3QD6,Bay Area Tech Junkie,4,2-Apr-14,True,Reviewed as a WiFi device,"I picked this up to use as a WiFi device with no immediate intention of activating Verizon prepaid service. The first thing you notice about this phone versus others is that it forces you through an activation process via a phone call with an automated Verizon robot. That was a little disturbing given why I bought it, however if you go through the process, it creates a Verizon account, you set the PIN for the account, and it assigns you a phone number, and the LAST step of the activation process is to enter payment information. If you hang up on the call on the last payment step, the phone will come to life with the assigned phone number, and it works as a WiFi device, even though it now has an assigned Verizon phone number. If you hang up before that point it continues to force you through the process - so go all the way through except payment. I took one star off for forcing customers through this activation process before you can use the phone. As other reviews say, it can't be beat for $99. The 4.5"" form factor is noticably smaller than say the Nexus 5 and Galaxy S3/4, 720P screen is nice, and I also was able to upgrade to Kit Kat 4.4.2 OTA over WiFi. The music player also sounds great. One disturbing note is that leaving it without mobile service and WiFi connected overnight it drained the battery to zero. Putting the device in airplane mode and only turning on WiFi seems to have fixed that - it drained from 100% to 63% overnight with those settings.",167.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

This reminds me of the original Nexus phone that I had. I loved that phone, and I love this phone. Let me get back on the battery life. If you're conscious about deleting the process often, then this can last two days easy. Even if it's at 15%, it lasts few hours.

Pros: lovely 5"" screen, quick and responsive touch, perfect size screen, Gorilla Glass! micro-usb charging (common), stock Android Kit Kat, upgradeable to Android L when released, MicroSD card slot, front stereo speakers, great call quality, great reception, price, unlocked (great for travel), no contract! Blutooth and Wifi work fine. No issues connecting to our home network and my wifes work wifi. Cons: No 4GLTE, Non Removable battery, No included headset/ear buds, LIMITED accessories so far(cases) Build Quality: Nothing to complain about. Perfect weight, feels solid, very tight, does NOT feel flimsy. The back phone cover is easily swappable. The black color is a deep matte black. Not slippery hard plastic, but a more rubberized feel. Battery life is very good. Not stellar, but easily lasts a complete day for my wife who is a average smartphone user. I just wish the battery was replaceable to increase longevity of the phone. This phone is perfect for the non-power user, average user, someone new to android, or is replacing their phone off contract. The specs are slightly above average for a phone in this price category! It is an amazing phone for under $200 off contract. 4G LTE would have been greatly appreciated, but it is not necessary because my wife's iphone 4 never had it either (and she is almost always connected to wifi anyways). I personally use the flagship LG G3 on AT&T (another AMAZING phone). so I set everything up for my wife (iphone4 user). I imported her contacts from her iphone which was simple after watching a few youtube videos on how to do it. Just search on youtube ""iPhone to Android Contact list"". The entire process after watching the video took 2 minutes lol. Of course this phone cannot compare to my LG G3, BUT, I was very impressed with this MotoG 2nd Gen. Contents: Box, Manuals, phone, and charging cable with plug. It is a wall plug with long microusb cable attached to the plug itself. Basically the wall plug adapter and the microusb cable cannot be separated. It is built as one single unit. NOTE* If you live in the UNITED STATES, buy the US GSM version. The Global version will work fine.... BUT the US GSM version is better suited for US cellular signals. I can confirm this phone works perfectly with AT&T and should work perfectly with T-mobile. I would order this phone again in a heartbeat for my wife. She loves it. I hope this review helps! ****Minor Update**** This phone continues to impress me. The screen is very bright and the colors are vivid and punchy. The screen resolution is more than adequate, it is very similar to the iphone 4 retina display. If you look closely, you can barely see pixels. Don't worry, the screen is very sharp and small text can be read with ease. After playing with the phone for over 12 hours, installing apps, configuring the phone, browsing the web, facebook, spotify, etc.. I still show 30% battery remaining from a full charge this morning! This was an intensive day of usage setting everything up. I easily downloaded 20+ apps, and probably 100 songs on spotify. , Do not be concerned about the lack of ""dual sim"". Unless you are a frequent traveler going overseas this is not an important feature. Dual sim is used so that when traveling, you can buy a foreign sim card and insert it into your phone without needing to remove your primary sim card (hence, dual sim). With this single sim US GSM model, just remove your sim and swap it out for the foreign sim card, no big deal. Just don't lose your primary sim card lol. *********************",658.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-2nd-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4HW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OLIW5q0eL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4HW0,3,99.0,0.0

It's not a bad camera, it's just not as good as some of the others. But for what I use it for, it's great. There strength is reception and all calls are crystal clear. Haven't had a drop call yet. I didn't want a behemoth phone to carry around. This phone is just the right size. Fits in your palm, fits in your pocket ,and the price fits my budget. I'm sure some will have it free by Black Friday. The battery life is great, streamed pandora for 3 hours and I'm still at 73%. But that is really dependent on your proximity to towers, but it's much better than my previous Droid Pro. it would be dead now, and it was only a 3g phone. This phone includes a full version of Chrome, and it syncs bookmarks between it and your home and work computers. I love it. Download a flashlight app and you will be able to light up your front yard. This puppy is bright. The picture quality is amazing. The customization is great. It has what they call ""smartactions"", I call them triggers. I programmed it to start Pandora, when it connects to my car over Bluetooth. There are many triggers you can program. Button placement is good, it feels good in the hand, and love the fact it is splash proof. Oh, and the navigation is awsome, sounds like a real person with this version. Another great new feature is talk and surf at the same time, something you couldn't do with older phones unless you were on AT&T.

Its a great size, battery life is excellent (85% after typical day), screen is just fine (despite what the on-line reviews say, I don't see any pixelation), camera takes pictures MUCH faster than the BIONIC, phone is very snappy. I'm a minimal usage user of the phone. I check email a few times a day when I'm not in front of a computer, send maybe five texts, make a phone call or two, and look up a few things (maps, browser) while I'm out and about. I have the phone set to use WiFi at home and work (which is most of the time), have 4G turned off (I'll turn it on if I need good data throughput), and have my screen sent to minimal brightness (use power controls widget to turn it up if I'm outside) to save battery life. 4G download speeds where 19.9 mbps down and 5.9 mbps up in the Louisville KY area. The only thing I don't like so far is the way the GMail app in ICS shows the sender's name in bold instead of the subject.

Finally, Moto Techs sent me another phone that allowed me to answer incoming calls, but the the new (refurbished) phone will automatically go to ""do not disturb"", so the phone will ring once and that is it !! I have to check it manually about every hour to make sure it doesn't go to ""do not disturb"". I use it as a business phone and figure it has easily cost me about $10,000.00 in business revenue.

Any screen with a white background is simply not white (bright), especially when compared to the other unit. As a result, images/photos, etc. appear darker on any given setting.

The whole thing is made of glass (gorilla glass?), which really looks awesome. I did buy a clear case for it and so far no bad accidents. It is surprisingly lightweight though not flimsy and not too large like some phones out there. Internet is much faster than my old phone (4 year old LG), though I don't use it much. Photos are crisp and true color. Calendar is nice and easy to use, but you have to pay attention to the little icons bc events don't pop up on the home screen. Same with voicemails. Ringer is LOUD and it has all the alarms & timers. Fingerprint reader works well and there's a backup ""pattern"" if you happen to use the wrong finger. Charging is fast and battery lasts a long time, sometimes days. I have Tracfone and have have no connectivity issues in my area (using Verizon tower, I think.) Bloatware is annoying, though.

3323,B00HPP3QD6,Joe,5,19-Jan-14,True,Best Verizon pre-paid ever offered Updated 10-19-2014,"It is a real smart phone with performance equal to the newer contract phones many of my friends have recently purchased. Has gorilla glass, good front and rear cameras, fast processor and great 4.5 inch sharp display. This phone replaces a HTC 3g Droid that ran ginger bread, the difference is amazing. I primarily use phone as a Kindle reader which it has worked well. Be advised the G stands for Google and it definitely has a presence on the phone. The phone is inexpensive so if I break it, I can just buy another. I have been a Verizon pre-paid customer for many years and now I almost want to thank them for making this phone available. Not going to thank Verizon though I will continue paying them $60 per month to use this cool phone on their very good network. 3G only, no micro-SD card slot, feels a bit slippery in my hand especially the back. Updated 10-19-2014 I have owned this phone for 10 months now and have important news to share! Verizon has a new plan which is $45 month with auto-pay and 1 gig data included, unlimited talk ,text. As I am not a heavy data user, I am thrilled. You still get Verizon coverage which is important for me. Verizon pre-paid site is hard to use but worth the hassle. As far as the phone has performed I am completley happy. Moto G has a really good reputation. I have found the sound quality is only OK. My purpose in updating my review today is: I had to release my hold on the phone while riding my bike. I was in a storm drain at the time so there was no traffic. The phone flew forward and hit HARD the corner of the phone on concrete. Due to my jungle cat like reflexes I avoided running over it with my bicycle. The first thing I thought was my Amazon review and how I could buy another one. The next thought was I do not want to spend another $90 right now. Imagine my surprise when I retrived the device and it functioned prefectly! This was a 6 foot drop at 5 mph. It's true, though I find it hard to fathom. It was protected with a $3 Fosmon gel cover, and an Illuminsheild screen prtector.

14916,B074VFRKZG,Lola the Diva,3,19-Feb-19,True,The camera is nothing special. The phone is very slick without a good case.,"Loved my Moto X Pure with a 21MP camera that was a 2 year old model because it took such great photos. Better than my daughter's newer iPhone or my other daughter's newer Samsung, both top of the line. Only bought this because I dropped the Moto X Pure and the gorilla glass screen cracked. Couldn't feel the crack but I couldn't revive the phone so was looking for another Moto thinking the camera would be great. It's not! Most photos are out of focus and the color is off. I knew this X4 only has a 12MP +5MP ""dual"" rear camera but there's not much info on how it works. It doesn't work well. I think it's nothing but a selling gimmick unless you want to put a cat or dog face on someone or photo shop something into another photo, so not for a serious camera user. Yet the camera that faces you for selfies is 16MP!! Also beware that both sides of this camera are gorilla glass and slick so it will probably crack if dropped. Get a good case! The speakers are so so in comparison to my old Moto X which was another disappointment. The phone looks nice and sleek but the camera sticks out farther than necessary and I can see that lense getting scratched eventually. Bought this phone on sale after Xmas at $189 and now right after the return time is up it's $149. Just my luck! Will be on the lookout for a better cell phone, in fact looking for another cell phone with better camera and speaker sound .

Verizon and Motorola make the claim that this phone is hardy and can handle some wear and tear. I have found that this is the most fragile phone i have ever owned. The screen has cracked two times with me. One time it fell out of my pocket while changing so from 2 or 3 feet above the ground and the whole thing shattered, although it could still be used. In hindsight i shouldve tried replacing the screen. Then two weeks later i was taking off my pants and it was still in the pocket. (it was not cracked when i put it in the pocket) When i took the phone out there was a tiny crack in the screen and then the bleeding started and within 24 hours the entire phone was inoperable. Verizon has refused to help in anyway. If i could get another phone i would. In addition to it being fragile the battery life is not that good, 18 hours has been my experience. Im locked into this phone for 2 years now and it sucks. I would say the other bells and whistles are nice but if i cant use it because its broken whats the point?

7314,B0192XJ0P6,Love2Shop,1,19-Dec-16,False,Going back to Samsung,"I was talked into the Droid Turbo 2 for two reasons when I upgraded from the Samsung Note 4. 1. Shatterproof (I drop my phone a lot) 2. Best camera on the market. (I take a lot of pics/videos) I was disappointed from the get go. It was very awkward to use... whenever someone would call, it would always be ""excuse me? What did you say? hello? Are you still there?"" I'd have to talk with the phone on speaker phone because not only was the call quality so poor the other person could never understand me, one wrong move and something would happen that would mute the call even though the mute button was untouched... it was weird. The only way to get through an entire call was to use the speaker. I went to Verizon and they said, ""oh that's common."" Common?? A phone you can't talk on?? Never had that issue with my Note 4! The camera (which was suppose to be so great) had less features than my Note 4 had... (My note 4 had nice options for capturing details, and smoothing out the front facing camera for a less traumatizing selfie... etc.) This camera basically has a front camera flash which I prefer not to use because it always washes the picture out and causes awkward shading. It also blurs very easily and it takes forever to get the right pic, which sucks when the pic you want to take is in motion. My Samsung had a motion option for better action shots... and close ups gave better details. The back of my phone is kind of fabric like I guess... I was having an issue with my phone shutting off for no reason so I took off the phone protector case to see what the issue was... and I found mold... actual freaking mold. They said I probably got it wet and under the case it molded, but I've been very careful about this phone since it's so new... it hasn't been dropped in water, I do not take it into the bathroom during showers, I can't think of anywhere it would have gotten wet enough to mold. Literally the next day after finding all of this and being told I got it moldy by getting it wet... the port is loose and the phone won't charge unless I tilt it to the left then wrap the charger cord around it and stick it in my drawer upside down. I've tried other chargers, but it's the port, not the charger itself. I've had nothing but crap since getting this phone. I should never have traded in my Note 4. the only reason I finally gave it up was because there were a few games that didn't seem to work properly on it... but they worked fine on other phones. Worst mistake ever. I'm now looking to buy a Note 4 back. Sucks that I'll continue to have to pay on this phone at the same time. but seriously it's not even worth paying the $100 deductible on my insurance when I can get a refurbished Note 4 for that.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola XT1585 Turbo 2, (32GB) 5.4'' (White, Verizon)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1585-Turbo-White-Verizon/dp/B0192XJ0P6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uo-nK+OAL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,2.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0192XJ0P6,289,0.0,0.0

4481,B00MWI4HW0,Calvin F,5,19-Apr-15,True,Absolute Value,"The value that is found here is outstanding. This phone is unlocked - it works on nearly ever GSM network in the entire world. SIM chips are easily changeable, meaning you can buy plans and SIM chips at will and use this phone as you please. No restrictions. No contract. No more financing your phone as if it were a car. Samsung phones are great, but they're $650. Apple phones are great, but they're $650+. Personally I prefer the Android operating system because I have more control and it is more customizable. In this Moto G you have, essentially, all the features of a $650 phone for a small price of $180. Except, this one is unlocked. One more caveat - since it only has 1GB of RAM it doesn't handle multitasking between 3+ apps like high-priced phones can. But, really, are you that needy? Is what you're doing really THAT important? Is the enslavement to a 2 year contract worth the difference in multitasking performance? Is locking yourself into a contract AND a provider with your phone choice worth the difference? For me it wasn't. I like to have a decent camera to capture memories, funny videos, etc. I like to have a phone that can make quality calls on provider networks AND over wifi with Android apps. I like a phone that I can use to text people - easily and efficiently. A phone that I can check my email on. A phone I can add space to (mini SD card). This is that phone. And luckily it's only $180. I'm not stuck in any contract - I can do literally whatever I want.

It worked fine for the first few months. It isn't flashy. It isn't top of the line. It is a basic android phone with a decent screen and features. The camera isn't too good but it isn't crap either. For about the last month the phone has been randomly turning off on its own. I didn't know why it was happening but it would just turn off. The the other day it turned off on its own, and refused to turn back on. I did some Google searching and it seems that this is more of a common problem than I thought. It happens to these phones often. Anyways, I tried the ""suggested"" methods of bringing my phone back online without much luck. So I requested a RMA with an exchange. Since their warranty is very limited and only good for 90 days. I am hoping they fix my phone, or send me a new one. And since it just died without warning, I was unable to back-up any data.

Loading apps has taken a little longer than I expect from a phone with power like this. The major downside to the phone is the battery life. I barely get 24 hours out of the phone with heavy usage.

5284,B00OZTSY6Y,Amazon Customer,5,19-Apr-15,False,Awesome phone,"So I just got this phone about two days ago, and so far it's is pretty awesome. I had this phone brought to India because it is a few hundred dollars cheaper than it is here, and it works perfectly. So if you are wondering if it will work in you country just make sure it has your band which it probably does and it will work. One this is I had to set up and account number when I bought it but as long as you don't activate the sin card you can just put in your own and use it. Pros -awesome screen. I mean it's freaking 2k it's just as just as good as you would think it is. There isn't a super huge difference between this and a 1080p screen but it's just a great screen. Also brightness levels are fine and it works pretty well outdoors, I do wish sometimes that it would go darker but this isn't a big deal and is easily fixed with and app. -build. People say that this phone is fat, and comparatively yes it is. But when you are actually holding it in your hand it doesn't feel fat at all it feels great. Also I really like the design and the Kevlar fabricy stuff. It is also very sturdy and doesn't feel like it will break any time soon -preformance. I am a pretty heavy user will be downloading multiple things and playing graphic intense game at the same time and this phone doesn't even stutter. I can do just about anything and this phone will fly through it all -battery. So as I said I'm a very heavy user so so far I've been seeing about 12 hours of battery life. Which doesn't sound very good but let me out this into perspective I was literally downloading apps while playing games for like five hours strait during that time so if you use it less intensively I can imagine you getting around. One and a half to two days on this thing with anywhere of 5-10 hours of on screen time. -stock android. Yes it's not lollipop but at least its not touchwiz so in happy. This things software flies and the moto feature can be helpful sometimes. And as long as it does eventually get lollipop I am happy -unlocked. Yes you can only buy it with Verizon but the actually ship this phone unlocked so can use it with any carrier or in any country. And yes you can't get it on a contract but I prefer to buy them unlocked at the full price anyway so it doesn't really effect me Cons - I have been noticing this phone heat up at times and even though it hasn't been a problem for me I Dont now what could happen in the future. -camera. the camera isn't the best but it is still plenty good it just doesn't live up to the 20 megapixel tag. It could be fixed by software updates in the future thought because the not so great pictures are just because of mediocre image processing. So overall this is an awesome phone the battery, screen and processor are undeniably awesome and I also like the software and design though that is more subjective. The few problems I identified, camera and heating up, Dont really affect me because I don't take many pictures and it doesn't get to hot so you can't use it. So it's a near perfect phone with problems that could easily get fixed with software updates that should be coming.

1291,B0096QYH80,Jo-Ann Nesiama,4,19-Apr-13,False,Droid Razr M better than I expexted!,"So to start off, this was the first smart phone ever, so my review might be a little biased. I have been available to upgrade for almost a year, but I had been skeptical about jumping into the smartphone band wagon mainly because of the extra fees for a data plan. Eventually I was tired of not having the convenience, so I closed my eyes and jumped in. Before I took off, however, I searched for the phone that I thought would be best for me. My first instinct was just to get an iPhone 4s, since it was cheap and almost everyone that had owned one loved it. But I really didn't want to conform to everyone's opinion, so I kept looking. I had heard quite a bit about android phones, so I took a peak. Personally, Motorola's Droid line stood out to me. Its rugged, industrial look and feel was exactly what I wanted in a phone. The next thing that was on my lost was screen size. I have HUGE hands' so getting anything smaller than a 4.3 inch display made me nervous. I was instantly attracted to the Droid RAZR HD and Droid RAZR Max HD. Their HD displays and large screen size was a big turn on for me. However their prices weren't, so I turned to the Droid RAZR M. And you know what I don't regret it. Look and Feel It is a hell lot slim! Its very compact and basically has no bezel. It has the rugged, industrial, tough feel that I like. The only down side is the screen is a bit too small for my liking. But that's just for me. The kevlar backing is also pretty cool, but considering the fact that I just slapped a case on the phone, doesn't really have much of an impression on me. The gorilla glass is also pretty slick. Not that I don't trust it, but I still put a screen protector on it. Display Obviously not as sick as its cousins, the RAZR HD and Max HD, the qHD screen isn't that bad. The video and picture quality is clean and its not difficult whatsoever to read, though its clothing compared to Apple's Retina Display. Camera One thing that's I cannot defend is the camera. Its really grainy when taking indoor pictures or videos and the flash rarely helps. Outside its pretty good. It can capture the colors and and shadows quite well, warrant that there is enough natural light. Still, i bought the phone for the phone, not the camera. Besides coming from the enV2, this camera was a huge upgrade. Call Quality Amazing! Simply amazing! When I speak to someone, he/she almost always comments on how clear my voice is. I can also hear from the other end quite well. There is minimum static and I have never had a dropped call as of yet. Processing Its pretty fast! Then again, of is my first smart phone.However, I have experienced some lag and on one event, o had to restart the phone because it froze. Otherwise its pretty fast. Android jelly bean 4.1 runs seamlessly on this device. 4g LTE with Verizon is a dream! This phone can have multiple apps open at once and still operate at blazing fast speeds. Download speeds are pretty fast and impressive as well. Overall So far I have had this phone for about two weeks and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. I know this is my first smartphone and honestly I would have been impressed with any phone I got, but this phone has yet to let me down.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

This happened to be a big issue for me as I'm using it in South Africa and this page/seller had no real conclusive information that the XT1095 'Pure Edition' was available. To help any other foreign potential buyers out the XT1095 is truly a 'global phone'. I can't vouch for the Unlocked AT&T version but this XT1095 version works perfectly abroad. The only issue I'm experiencing is that it isn't picking up 4G on the CellC network however this may be due to a coverage issue and not missing band problem. Apart from that the HSDPA+ works perfectly with strong signal. The device itself is built great with the metal band and (in my case) bamboo back giving it an air of quality few can match at the price. Regarding the numerous reviews targeting the brittle screen which was a big concern of mine, I have no screen protector (I do have a case) and am pleased to report zero issues thus far with scratches or cracks. I look after it but don't feel I treat it any differently from my old phone. Its still early days with the phone but so far I am pleased with the durability of the gorgeous AMOLED screen. I haven't had a chance to truly test the camera but did notice the rather simple UI for the camera app. The few pictures I've taken were adequate in low light. However in well lit scenes it shines, matching higher priced rivals. The performance of the phone is smooth and without issue. It may not have the latest and greatest hardware but running the pure Andriod experience it moves swiftly. This in conjunction with the motion sensors that light up your display, showing notifications when reaching for your phone really made me look at phones differently. Features like this that are usually gimmicks on other brands end up being so useful with this Moto X that you really miss them when using a friends phone. It's not the hardware that defines the phone exclusively, it's how it all comes together and this Moto X (2nd Gen) has excelled in that regard. My only issue would be the battery life. Charges last a full day with wifi only pushing two. Hard usage drops this but the inclusion of a fast charger, which works great, is appreciated A bigger capacity battery would have truly taking this phone to another level. If you can go the route of a 32Gb model I suggest you do as a total usable space of 10.17GB isn't much. Add some music and a couple of apps/movies/pictures and that number depletes quickly. Overall for the price (trust me I researched every available option) this phone in my opinion is one of, if not the best you can get for $300.

190,B002UHS0UI,Roger Williams,2,18-Sep-11,False,VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES,"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum).

150,B002UHS0UI,Roger Williams,2,18-Sep-11,True,Get It Now or Get It Not.. it's a gamble,"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.

My first was a Samsung note 2 that finally quit after 5 years of use, purchased that phone brand new. This phone seems to have a louder amp, then the note 2. Perhaps the perception is driven by the fact the G6s speaker is in the front. Camera seems to be decent for casual shooting. However If you want to take serious photography, get a real dedicated camera for that task. A feature that I like with the new android, on the note 6, is that a text SMS, will pop up automatically, if you are in another ap, without the need to switch back and forth. And and all great budget phone at a very decent price for what you get, and you get a lot for your money. I purchased the 32gb model.

5328,B00OZTSY6Y,Jeff Mahoney,5,18-May-15,True,My favorite phone so far.,"Here's my experience so far. I've had it for 4 days. My last phone was a Droid Razr Maxx HD. It was a dual core processor. I really like the Droid Turbo. This thing is zippy. When you touch a button or control, it responds immediately. The startup time from off to fully operational takes about 25% of the time than it did for the Droid Razr. I have a better processor on my phone than I do on my laptop! Ok, the battery: People have been complaining that the battery isn't lasting as long as the Motorola statements. The first day I had this I charged it completely. I was downloading all kinds of apps, tweaking settings, I turned on every Moto feature including the one where it listened to every word I said and waited like the most well trained dog on the planet just to hear one phrase. (Let me just say that I find that a little unsettling; I'm not big into conspiracy theories, nor am I highly paranoid, there's gotta be some folks out there that are worrying that Google is recording everything). Back to the battery: The battery last about 17 hours including when I was sleeping on the first day. Now, the second day, I turned off all the Moto features, disabled all the bloatware that got loaded by Motorola or Google or Verizon (whatever); now I was back to my daily routine. I am not a gamer. I do watch YouTube videos, I had to test my Chrome Cast. Read lots of emails and made a few phone calls and nitpicked a few settings. Bluetooth was off. Brightness on Auto. After 60.5 hours (2 Days, 12.5 hours) I still have 27% juice left. That includes two nights of sleep. Stats: 24% standby, 19% screen, 17% Wi-Fi, 10% Google Play Services, 10% Idle, 6% Android System, 6% Android OS, 5% Google Apps. The Droid Razr didn't do quite as well after 2 years. Maybe after 2 years the Droid Turbo will lose a little battery strength. Do I care if I can't take out the battery? Nope. The Razr wouldn't allow that either. Charging: Wow! Yup Wow! I wasn't watching too close, but I swear it took less than 2 hours to go from less than 20% to full. The screen is much larger, but I'm enjoying that because my reading glasses aren't always with me. I really don't notice much of a difference in picture quality. The video quality is nice. I am really disappointed that there is no LED notification. What were ya thinkin' Moto!? I relied on that light. I had set email and text messages to be a different color. If the light was flashing green, I had a text. Now what do I get????? The screen gently displays a symbol from the notifying app every few seconds. I can't see that from an angle. Fail! The new sensor across the top of the phone is a great feature. All I have to do is move my hand near it and it displays the status (time and notifications). No having to push the power button just to read the time or see if I have a text. I'm still leaving off the other feature of waving my hand to silence the phone. Don't know if I'll use it unless I find myself having more meetings. I probably won't use Droid Zap. Sharing files instantly with others is not a big deal to me. The camera quality is very good. I can select the focus area, tap the screen or push the volume button to take a picture. Haven't seen any drawbacks yet. I like that I can shake the phone and can be taking pictures in about 3 seconds! The sound quality is on par with previous phones. No problems with the speaker phone even though the speaker is facing forward now. I tested to see if I was cutting out off others or they were interrupting me. No issues. I have the nylon ballistic case. It is slippery. Solved by putting sticky dots on the back. Stop buying screen protectors. My Razr never had one; not a scratch on it. Gorilla glass solved that problem. You might as well buy one of those useless antenna stickers you put on your battery to improve reception while your at it. Pros: Battery (great time between charges) Charging (phenomenal) Performance (fantastic) Screen size and quality (good) Sound (good) Camera (good) Cons: No LED notification light (sadly shaking my head) I can still see smudges on the screen (ha, good luck with that) Not fully waterproof (not a big deal)",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0
3518,B00HPP3QD6,sallyz,2,18-May-14,True,UPDATE OF REVIEW,"Update of Review: (8-4-14) I have been using this phone for almost 3-4 months now and it definitely has some flaws (sometimes will not let u make/receive calls or texts, wont send pix on texts, will say there are not available funds, etc) all of these are corrected once u contact Verizon after waiting on hold from anywhere between 10-20 minutes. I loved the phone when I first got it and bought my husband one, he is on his second one (first one, backlight went out in less than a month) second one has the same flaws as mentioned above but occur much more frequently (at least two or three times a month) we are both ready to junk the phones and go to the Moto X (because the phone really is great when it works and so user friendly) but too hassling to be calling support all the time. Verizon prepaid is NOT the same service as Verizon contract! I guess you get what u pay for and since we only paid $70 it's not too bad, just hassling, grrrr! Initial Review - 5/18/14 received the phone from amazon in two days and got a deal at $91. the phone is sleek, feels great to hold (also ordered a rubber-like case in dark blue that reduces slipperiness) . called Verizon and was walked through the activation (which took over an hour) due to the guy trying to update system to KitKat OS which it refused to do so he told me to take it into the Verizon store on Monday. he said the porting of my current # to the moto g could take from 4-24 hours and I could check the status by dialing a certain # he provided or simply *611, however, he neglected to mention that both of these would give a message that I was roaming and I could pay for the service by entering my credit card #!!!!! I tried calling both numbers from my old phone and got the same response then went on line and tried to use the temporary phone # given to me, my current phone #, and the old account number when trying to sign in -- no dice, kept saying not enough information (despite the fact that the guy who was helping me said that any of those would work if I wanted to go online). finally used my husband's online account and had a chat session (with another very helpful, courteous person) who explained that the reason for the message about roaming was due to the fact that the device was still in the ""porting process"" and is not actually able to be used as a phone until the # is ported which she said could be up to 72 hours :(. I'm just beyond 24 hours so, hopefully, it will complete before too long. I'm happy I still have about 6 days left on my straight talk account because the old device has to be up and running throughout this process. I'm still excited about this phone and looking forward to using it but thought I would give a little heads up info so the next buyer doesn't wait until the last minute to change over from one account to the other.",6.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

1305,B0096QYH80,Jason Christian,5,18-Mar-13,False,Best Droid Yet!,"I have been through many Droid phones within the last few years, and while each one was improving on the last, it seemed that it was starting to get a bit redundant with basically the same phone in a different ""shell."" So when it came time to get a new phone again, I had started heavily considering the iPhone. But then I saw the Razr M while browsing the store, and I had to try it out. I was amazed at how fast the phone was, considering its size. I had the Razr at the time, and the Razr M made it look horribly slow. As I continued to play around with the phone, I loved how easy it was to customize, from adding extra ""home page"" slides, to favorite apps, this phone was phenomenal. Now that I have had the phone for a while, I have found I like it even more. Not only does it have every feature from the Razr, including a good quality camera (for a cell phone at least), it had made improvements on many of the features, including the phone being lighter, smaller and yet still having a very large screen. The best part about this phone to me so far has been the battery life. In a normal days use, I never see the battery go below about 60% battery life, and that with web browsing, email, text, and the unlimited data plan. I have found some apps that drain the battery within an hour, but an Task Killer App (I prefer Advanced Task Manager), pretty much made this a non-issue. I have also found the internal antenna to be better in this phone, as I constantly have 4G in my house on it, whereas my old Razr would only get 4G in the upstairs bedroom. All in all, this phone is awesome. It is super fast, the touch screen works great and is very bright, and the phone overall is very easy to use even for someone who has never had a smartphone.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

22738,B07NP6R2RG,Kenny Mac,5,18-Jun-19,True,Moto G7 - Still Got The Goods But see update,"Update 6/29). Dang, dang, dang. And I so like this phone. Big HOWEVER. Battery drains. Down 15% after less than 2 hours. Just web surfing. I started noticing this soon after I got it. Sending it back. Will try Moto Power. Update to follow. ================================= OK, I had a Moto 5g and I really liked it. Moved off of it to a Huawei phone for a bit (don't buy one), then went back to the Moto. Then I remembered why I moved off of it in the first place...the little connector to charge the battery failed. So now, I have the new Moto G7. I'm hoping the connector issues is long gone. I think the Moto G7 compares favorably to the OnePlus 6 (perhaps the camera isn't quite there, but real close). Basically you are purchasing the Best phone of 2017/early 18 for a fraction of the cost. Comes with a case, and it's USB-c, so you will get a faster charge (plus side) but your old usb connectors/chargers won't work (negative side). All in all, this looks like it will be another great phone. It's the International top of the line version (2 sim dockets, and 1 micro SD card). I read a review that said they were 'bulky'. LOL. A, no. No more bulky than your typical phone. Has a 3.5mm earphone jack, and a built in (no internet required) FM radio. Battery life seems good so far. I read it holds a charge for 15.5 hours. We'll see when/if I do an update. Note: The reviewers are constantly giving these phone 4 our of 5 stars because they HAVE TO find fault at this price. How come no matter how much better they make them, and they do, they still only get 4 out of 5 stars? Hmmm, I'm calling BS on the rating system. How about they rate the newest iphone 5 Stars then subtract 1 star for the high price? Yeah, think about that. Look, if you've read this far, you're seriously thinking about this phone. Just buy it. Great phone for a reasonable price. Sell your Apple Stock - those high end phones are destined to become commodities in a few years, and I'm thinking Apple's stock will tank.

The only reasons I recently ordered a new phone are that this one is too banged up from many drops, and I want more storage (also I just want a new phone....) THE CONS: Limited storage made worse by bloatware, but that's pretty typical; you can only download a few bigger apps and have to constantly remove pics and delete text messages to make room but what do you expect at this price Phone lags and won't update when internal memory is too full but like any phone does that Pretty crappy front camera, not too good for selfies tbh Battery feels hot sometimes if using the phone while it's plugged in but I'm probably not even supposed to do that so, Battery is internal so you can't change it out or remove it if you were so inclined THE PROS: Really inexpensive Dropped this phone probably 50 times on hard surfaces including cement and it never even turned off, tho my screen is now finally cracked in two places Dropped in a bucket of water and also once in a toilet and it never stuttered Left on dash of my truck on a hot day and it was fine Left in my truck overnight during Minnesota winter when it was like -30 and it was fine (maybe this is normal tho I dunno ???) Relatively long battery life even with running apps like YouTube (easily can go 24 hours without charging with just regular use) Runs pretty smoothly without lag as long as the memory isn't fill Battery is internal so it won't pop out if you drop the phone Apps rarely crash or need force stop Surpringly nice pics from the rear facing camera Good quality video and sound recording Good call quality Can expand memory with SD card Good for listening to music with headphones Images on screen are pretty crisp Surprisingly okay preloaded ringtones???

But that's not so much the phone as it is the OS. Best part ... I paired this with the $45 all-inclusive auto prepay plan at Verizon. I get unlimited phone and text, and because I auto-pay, they double the data from 500mb to 1gb each month. Because I do so much of my data over WiFi, I haven't come close to surpassing the 1gb in the three months that I've had the phone. One other thing to think about is tax. As a pre-pay plan, it's very low. Never any BS charges, so I never pay more than $48 and change.

Yes these were all from Amazon and not a 3rd party provider. Phone is wonderful and 5 stars BUT it's only a day old. Great value for the $. My main concern is not having a replaceable battery and only time will tell how that works out. My old Droid X2 lasted 8 years, but went through 2 batteries. Then I suffered through the Galaxy S5 charging debacle and hence, this phone purchase. As an additional data point, our son just bought a pixel 3 and paid 3 times what this cost and said he wished he'd bought one of these after checking out the features. I'd agree. I'm not sure what the CONOPS is for rating the features, but it seems a bit absurd to have battery life and durability as sub rating areas.

1384,B0096QYH80,David B.,2,18-Jan-13,False,"Good phone, but the screen is garbage.","UPDATE: I originally gave this phone a negative review due to the PenTile display. I have since learned that many PenTile displays look great, but unfortunately this one does not. The resolution on this phone is too low for PenTile and makes everything grainy, pixelated, etc. Colors are oversaturated, small text is hard to read. The biggest problem is white areas, which appear gray/orange, or like colored dots. Most web pages have a white background, so it's a constant annoyance. It gets worse if you turn down the brightness. Some people may not mind, but it was a deal-breaker for me. I returned the phone to Amazon. Many of the older displays suffered these problems, but as resolutions have improved, the issues have mostly gone away. Aside from the display, the RAZR M is a nice phone. The interface is intuitive and fast, the build quality seems solid. The speaker gets really loud. The phone's very thin, almost too thin for me. I'd prefer a little more to hold on to, but it seems comfortable enough. Although Amazon says it runs Ice Cream Sandwich, it's actually been updated to Jelly Bean. Non-removable battery and limited 8GB storage for applications might be an issue for some, but not a big deal to me. Sadly I just couldn't live with that display, it ruined the experience for me.

1361,B0096QYH80,Diane,5,18-Jan-13,False,Best phone I have ever owned.,"I cannot sing enough praises about this beautiful little device. My boyfriend has had the Droid Razr for about 7 months and I have been extremely jealous of all of his internet browsing capabilities for a long time. I was stuck with a Samsung Exhibit 4G for a while from a useless wireless provider in Cincinnati, Ohio called Cincinnati Bell. The provider sent me a text message to inform me that 80% of my data usage has to be done in Cincinnati or Dayton areas. Well, that's kind of hard for me being a college student living 3 hours away from home. So, I dropped their ""service"" and switched to Verizon. Best decision ever made. Verizon is a wonderful provider, as many know already. But this review is about the Droid Razr M, which I will try to stay focused on. I have had quite a bit of experience with the Droid Razr, because it is the phone my boyfriend has, and now that I have the Razr M, we can both see some very clear improvements: * Edge- to-Edge screen * Less wide, more hand/pocket friendly size * Lightening fast Jelly Bean operating system * Only $50 with a new two-year plan with Verizon * Long battery life I can run on a single charge all day. I would say that I am on my phone more often than my boyfriend is on his phone and yet here it is at 10:20pm and my phone has 40% battery life while his Droid Razr is nearly dead. (Both woke up around 9am) I like that the main three icons (back, home, recent apps) are now a part of the main ever-changing touch screen. There is now no menu icon, but sometimes you will see a ... icon to the right of the recent app icon, which comes and goes as needed. Sometimes the ""back"" icon changes to a down-arrow when the keyboard is up to allow you to hide the keyboard. I like the ""circles"" widget that comes with the operating system, which allows you to see the Current date, time, set your alarm, view the weather, and view your battery. There is a Quick Settings option when you are on the homescreen and you swipe your finger from left to right. This screen is so useful because now I can access commonly sought after items in the settings like ringtone on/off, Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Mobile Data, and airplane mode. It it is a screen that is very like a swtichboard which allows you to turn these things off and on as needed. Anyways, all in all, there are lots of things to love about this fine phone and its fine operating system. I love it and if you are on your phone often, this one is great for you because it has 1GB RAM and can pretty much take any amount of app usage you want to throw at it without crashing. \",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

I've been an iPhone user for years and wasn't sure how well I would do with the Android platform. It was a totally unnecessary worry because I ended up liking this phone more than I thought I would! First off, the software is really good and there are a lot of customizable options. It took a few weeks to get the hang of it, but after I did even I had to admit that the customizations were cool and useful. I love that you can just say ""OK Google"" and Google Search will pop up so that you can say what you want to search for. It's great when I'm trying to get directions on the go or am looking to find phone numbers for different places. It pays attention to what you search for and gives you alerts, if you set up your gmail it will even list packages that you are tracking and give you traffic updates on places that you usually travel to. The screen is big and impressive. It's a beautiful display and the colors and images really pop out at you. The body feels sturdy and not cheap, and has a modern look. To be honest I didn't think much about Motorola phones before, but having this one changed my mind completely. Their design for this model looks great! As for the camera, that is were this phone takes its biggest hit. It definitely doesn't have the best camera, although it's pictures in good lighting turn out rather nicely. Low lighting and indoor/outdoor night photos turn out rather badly. I think it struggles in those areas even more due to it's lack of image stabilization which is slower and harder to focus in my opinion. The HDR option is a hit or miss, more often than not making pictures come out looking kind of wonky. The editing that you can do on the photos is terrible are more like Instagram filters. I didn't find this feature useful at all. This phone's design is highly customizable as well, and it was a feature that I took advantage of. I chose a teal back and purple accents with a white front plate and I've gotten many comments on how nice it looks. I even got my name engraved on the back. They are small things, but enough to give you the feel that your phone is a little more one of a kind without actually being one of a kind. Overall, the phone is very easy to use and the amount of control you have over the phone is really awesome.

5314,B00OZTSY6Y,Bera Moose,5,18-Dec-15,True,4.5 stars for this beast,"I got my Droid from Edge cellular. Item was listed ""As New"" and it matched the description, it was in mint condition. It took a few days to activate it on Verizon. I think the previous owner never registered it. I added the phone on my Motorola site, and surprise, it's still under warranty until April 2016. Now for the phone itself. Even if it's last year's flagship, I can still consider it top of the line right now. Everything is snappy, no lag, handles everything without a hitch. It may get a bit warm (not hot) during some heavy applications and games, but it's not an issue. Front speak is a bit weak, my Moto E 2nd gen gets louder, even though not that crisp. My biggest surprise was the battery. I was expecting something better. I think if the screen would have been 1080p instead of quad HD, you would get 50% more screen time. Right now I get less use compared to the Moto E, making it through the day. It's a good trade off though for the screen clarity and processor power.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0
5276,B00OZTSY6Y,Amazon Customer,4,18-Dec-14,False,A beast of a phone in a slightly cheap feeling body. Highly recommended,"I got tired of waiting for proof that the unicorn (64GB Nexus 6 on Verizon) exists and pulled the trigger on the 64GB Turbo. I'm very happy with my decision and have no regrets. This is my first Motorola Android phone and I'm really impressive with their software. I love stock Android and think all their additions on top are actually super helpful. Pros: Specs on par with Nexus 6. The size is perfect and can be used 1-handed. Really fast and smooth experience everywhere. Basically stock Android with actual improvements added. Very capable battery. Trubo charging is pretty handy. Decent camera. The price is right. Water resistant. Cons: Body has a plasticy feel compared to other flagship phones. Nylon on the back is fine, but looks like it will fray over time. Camera is slow to take, which will hopefully be fixed with an update. No Lollipop update yet. Lots of Verizon bloatware pre-installed, but it's easy enough to unintall/disable all those in <10min. Other notes: the capacitive buttons (vs on screen) don't bug me at all.

1358,B0096QYH80,Aoi Kitsune,4,18-Aug-13,False,"Overall, I'm very pleased with this phone (update)","I have to say that this little guy packs quite a punch. I had an LG Lucid before this phone...six of them!!! That phone was terrible and showcased the worst of android software and hardware. I had software issues, charger port issues, wrong number issues, and screen problems that took their own toll. Bottom line: that was my first LG product and my last one PERIOD. I'm sorry for that rant. That was just a horrible experience. Onto this phone. At first, I thought I was going to get the Galaxy Nexus, but they upgraded me to this phone because they were out of stock on the Nexus. This phone feels really nice in my hand. While I'd want something high-end like a Note II, this phone made me realize how smaller devices are still very necessary for many users. Not only that, but this phone feels tough. I mean REALLY tough. I dropped this thing, caseless in a restroom and it didn't even get a dent or chip. The screen, is really strong as well. I guess Gorilla Glass 2 makes a huge difference. The colors are nice and vibrant, though unrealistically a bit over saturated, but doesn't look bad by any means. The resolution may not be as high as people hope for, but this is the highest I had on a phone so far. Just remember, this is a budget phone. In terms of hardware, like I said this thing is solid. With this thing being water resistant (not waterproof), made out of aircraft Aluminum and Kevlar backing, and Gorilla Glass 2, you get incredible value for what you pay for. The camera is also nice. Nothing to write home about though. It can be hard to focus and the lighting Is a little hard. I don't know, maybe I need to play with the settings more, and perhaps even experiment with camera apps on Google Play. At least it takes pics pretty fast. For the internal hardware, you get a gig of ram, with the same 1.5 dual-core processor found on the Galaxy SIII. Pretty darn good for a midrange phone if you ask me. One thing that people may not be too thrilled about (and believe me, I'm not either) is that while you get 8GB of storage, you only have 3.5 to 4GB to the user. I sort of half expected this, considering this is a budget phone. However, I have a bunch of apps installed and still have 1.5 free so I can't complain too much. I'm not blaming the OS for the amount of storage it takes, but rather the amount of bloatware apps Verizon insists on having and cannot even remove. They really can't even take a hint that we don't want a lot of these apps. I don't mind the Amazon apps because I love Amazon, I like Kindle, and who wouldn't want a free app a day on their Appstore. I really could care less about the Audible app (but I might get into it someday), but what I don't want is the NFL, Zappos, and the annoying VZ Navigator, all of which you can't even uninstall. You can just disable them so they don't show, but then it just becomes dead space. Like it was to begin with. I do like the office suite you get on it though. You can install a 32 GB micro SD card for your music, pictures, videos, and whatever else you need on there, though I have heard of people going up to 64 GB, depending on the class. I have a 16 GB installed, but will probably get a 32 or 64. If my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet says it can go up to 32, but it can actually accept 64, then I might look into it for this phone. Also, the battery life is fantastic. I'm a fairly heavy phone user with apps like youtube and Google Chrome, but it has gotten me through the morning to late evening, and even to the nexy day. Performance wise, this phone runs like a dream. I'm not a hard core gamer on my phone, but I've seen Dead Trigger running great on a YouTube review. I play a few games like Words With Friends, the Tetris games from EA, maybe some other casual and retro platformers, and emulators. They all work very well on this phone. Software wise, it is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with MotoBlur on top. You'd think that Motorola's skin would be intrusive, but it really isn't all that bad. In fact, of all the custom skins put out by Samsung and HTC, this actually looks really close to stock, and to a lot of users, that is welcoming. I guess since Google acquired Motorola, they only let their costum UI only enhance stock Android. I like the Smartactions, but in all honesty, this is all stuff that you can do manually. Moreover, Google Now is on here, which is like iOS's Suri, but in a class of its own. I don't think you'll be to disappointed in the accuracy of the voice recognition. After all, this company has been building on this foundation for years since before Suri was even born. I do like the circles widget. It's very handy, but I wish it was more transparent so it doesn't block so much of my wallpaper. Call quality is good on this phone. The people I talked to sounded clear, but they said I sounded a bit fuzzy. The speaker is pretty good too, even for music and videos. When I connect my Skullcanfd headphones and earbuds, the sound was terrific. Here are some apps that I recommend for this phone specifically: Light Flow - good for customizing this phone' s notification LED for specific apps like Facebook as this phone has multiple color lights supported, but can't be found in the phone settings. There's a lite and paid version. Notification Light Widget - if your notification LED isn't on by default, you will need this. And it is actually made by Motorola. Rather than pushing an update to edit notification lights in the phone settings, they just made this widget instead. Notification Toggles - one thing I missed from the Lucid is that I could pull down the notification bar and have quick settings to tap like screen brightness and data on/off. This phone has no such fair, but with this, you can and then some. Conclusion: Overall, despite some flaws, this is a great phone for the price. The hardware and software is really good for the price and the screen is just the right size. If you get a Verizon salesman pushing another phone like either of the LG Lucids or Samsung Stratospheres, reject them and get this phone. This phone has had a lot of thought, care, and quality put into it, unlike those others I've mentioned. I will update on the camera once I play with it more along with other areas of the phone. Update: so far, I'm still rocking this phone very well and it hasn't had any scratches or dents at all. I'm still taking experimenting with the camera as I haven't had much of a chance to do so, but the pictures are good for the most part. Performance is still excellent overall. Still the best phone you can get at an affordable price!",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

9892,B01LEL8ABY,Theresa S.,1,17-Sep-18,False,product failed in less than 1 year- will never buy Motorola again.,"I was given this phone as a Christmas gift in 2016. Within 8-9 months, the phone starting shutting off for no reason (even with a full battery). I bought a Moto-Mod battery and it helped for another 8-9 months or so, but then the phone continued to shut off, or suffer extremely erratic battery drain (even in airplane mode) followed by shut off, ALL DAY LONG. Now it won't even stay on if it's plugged in; it just restarts and immediately shuts down over and over, so the phone is completely useless. If you search internet forums for battery/shut down issues, you will find hundreds of pages of complaints about the problem. Motorola has not addressed or taken ANY responsibility for the issue, and blames Android updates for the problem. I have followed every single suggestion Motorola provides as a ""fix"" and NONE of them work (factory reset, safe mode, clear cache, etc.). I took it to a repair shop and several techs agreed that this problem is occurring EVERYWHERE and that Motorola has made a faulty product. They said that the only way to fix it was to replace most of the internal parts of the phone and cross my fingers, at a cost equal to buying a new phone outright. For a phone at this price point, there is absolutely no acceptable reason for this. Before all the problems started, this had been my hands down favorite phone since the early 2000's. I loved everything about it. However, Motorola won't stand by their product, and I can honestly say I will NEVER buy another Motorola product again.

Two months in my spouse dropped the phone (about 1.5') onto a tile floor and the screen cracked EVERYWHERE (gorilla glass......). We had that fixed by Motorola for a decent chunk of change and went on our merry way. Around six months in my GPS begins to drop off constantly. I contacted Motorola and they had me run a few tests and the phone passed said tests. I expressed that this is an intermittent and highly annoying issue, but received no additional help after running a sea of tests and explaining the situation. This is a very common issue plastered all over multiple forums that Motorola has never addressed in firmware/software updated. GPS still works intermittently on my phone and cuts out when you need it most. The most recent and pressing issue occurred on my spouses phone where the bottom portion of her screen has entirely stopped working to touch feedback, which effectively makes the phone a paperweight.

That is simply amazing. In addition, the phone is much easier to carry in a pocket and hold in the hand than the Samsung...basically the same size as the Iphone 5. Working it one-handed is no problem...seems to be the perfect size. The case also seems much better-built and stronger than on the Sammy or the Iphone (the Iphone is known to scratch).

18352,B07C2VFMN2,Brendan W.,5,17-Nov-19,True,Great value for the price,I've had Samsung phones for the last 10 plus years and was a big fan of the active series. I decided to give the Motorola a try after the 7active had a screen failure @ 8 months old and the S8 active decided to completely die one day and didn't like the s10 at all. I really like the motoz because the lay out is similar and the price can't be beat. The fingerprint scanner makes it quick and easy to turn on without typing in a pin. The phone seems very responsive and haven't had any issues so far. I'd definitely buy one again and would recommend it to any one who is used to a Droid and likes a simple layout,2.0,Motorola,Motorola Z3 Play & Moto Power Pack - Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) - 64GB - Deep Indigo (US Warranty) - PA9S0000US,https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z3-Play-Power-Pack/dp/B07C2VFMN2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N-Axwzz1L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07C2VFMN2,84,229.99,499.99

It charges quickly, has an extremely long battery life, is nearly indestructible, and has one of the best cameras available. Unfortunately software malfunctions are so pervasive in this model I'm concerned I won't make it till the end of my contract with verizon. My first issue was battery related. It would charge to 100% within minutes, then drain within minutes to 0 %. I tried a factory reset and several other troubleshoots before having to sending it in. Instead of dealing with the carrier like most phones purchased through verizon I was transferred to a Motorolla agent where I had to make a $599 deposit held in lieu of the phones return whilst they sent me a new one. To me that's insane. Most phones I've had exchanged immediately right there in the store. Well here I am again, about 4 months after receiving my replacement and the phone shut off while in my pocket. It wouldn't turn on unless on a charger and put into fast boot mode, but it freezes when trying to put it into factory reset. Again I have to send it back in, this time for a $300 deposit thankfully a bit cheaper. Each time there is a service fee of $50, so at this point I guess it's a $700 phone.

8453,B01DZJFWNC,A customer,1,17-Mar-18,True,The worst cell phone I ever owned.,"I've owned quite a few cell phones over the years. This phone, even before the warranty ended, started to act strangely. About 9 months into owning it, the phone had ghost touch as if somebody was touching the buttons (not me)! It went to different apps without me touching them. It even called my mom in the middle of the night once! The service desk told me to try a few things and call them back if necessary. After I tried many things, and called them several times, the problem was still there and the warranty expired. Then, 1 year and 2 months into owning this phone, it started to shut down on its own. I thought it was out of battery first, then it shut even at times like 10 minutes after it was charged to 100%. It became completely usable as a cell phone, since I couldn't restart it unless it was plugged into a charger. This phone shuts down upon using the camera, shuts down upon receiving text messages and upon receiving phone calls. Even in safe mode it shuts off with 97% battery in it as soon as I try to use the camera. Besides battery calibration, cache clear, factory reset, safe mode test, I also searched on the internet for solutions of Moto G4 plus random shut down.

5393,B00TFAVFL4,Mike,5,17-Mar-15,True,Excellent phone at a low price,"Much improved from last years model on every level whether it be the larger screen, autofocus camera, larger battery or upgraded CPU. I've been a journeyman looking for the best cell phone at a reasonable price point after issues with my iphone 6 shortly after launch, and finger pointing with carrier and vendor. I decided to buy an unlocked phone - and went through a number of options from Blu, to the One Plus One. I haven't been completely satisfied until my Moto E LTE arrived Friday, which I can say is an awesome offering at an extremely low price point. I had previously used a 2014 Moto G as well, however had some performance issues and battery life was less than expected. I can happily say neither of those issues are present with the new Moto E. I use this device with AT&T and was able to simply call, provide the IMEI, and utilize my old LTE sim card to activate the service. On first reboot I did not receive LTE, the rep was able to assist in enabling the LTE service properly - this seems to be an issue of the past with AT&T and unlocked phones as the procedure was painless. LTE Performance seems pretty reasonable on par with the other two devices I tested - iPhone 6 and One Plus One - all receive roughly 30 to 32 Mbps at my current location. The LTE model ships with the new Snapdragon 410, which is 64-bit, however the Android 5.02 version the device ships with is in fact the 32-bit offering. Performance seems to be much better than the older 400 which still ships in the LTE Moto G, and Non-LTE 2015 Moto E. I assume these are more power efficient as well because I seem to be getting about 8 to 9 hours of screen on time with the device. The camera now features autofocus which I believe was not the case last year, however it is still limited to 5MP in 4:3 shots, and does not include a flash. Pictures in well lit rooms seem decent enough, don't expect this to replace a standalone camera however and you probably wont be disappointed. After 52 minutes of screen on time this morning, and 2 hours of screen on time, I am at 88% battery still which is more than reasonable. I haven't had a full day of use for work yet but will update my review with full battery impressions once I have an idea of a full day use on a charge. Call quality seems pretty good, I've only had 1 call with the integrated speaker, as I generally use a bluetooth headset with my calls. The phone is a little smaller than I expected, but coming from larger handsets I actually welcome the ability to hold the phone and type text messages with the same hand in a trouble free fashion. 2 handed operation is more difficult to hide in work meetings. I have not done much in the way of benchmarking but I did have a chance to run Antutu - i received 22,103 on my first run which is respectable but certainly not a chart topper. Daily performance seems very solid as I mentioned above however. Overall I couldn't be happier so far with my new phone, it has all the things I was looking for - great battery life, extremely stable, and fairly compact after trying out some larger phones. Pros: Great Price Point Compact Design Snapdragon 410 LTE at a low cost and simple setup with AT&T Excellent Battery Life Moto has great device support and ships with Android 5.02 Cons: 1gb RAM Low Res Display No Camera Flash",53.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto E (2nd Generation) Locked Cellphone, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Locked-Cellphone/dp/B00TFAVFL4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T5JR5djdL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00TFAVFL4,1,0.0,0.0
5401,B00TFAVFL4,Joe Bear,5,17-Mar-15,False,Wau,"I bought this straight from Motorola the day it was publicly announced, and I absolutely love this handset! While I was bummed about Youtube scaling back to 480p software wise, you can tell that the screen is actually pretty phenomenal for its class when streaming 1080p Netflix (the difference is very visible even on a qHD screen). As a daily driver, I actually prefer the Moto E 2nd Gen LTE to my ol' Nexus 5, because the battery lasts much longer, which helps the Moto E carry daily tasks out better. I *REALLY* love how the Moto E fits in my hand. To me it's definitely better feeling in the hand than an HTC One M7, especially when the M7 gets toasty. The Moto E tends to also stay relatively cool under stress, which I can't say for my One M7 and Nexus 5. But overall the Moto E feels a lot ""friendlier"" than any of the aforementioned phones, and I have a lot more peace of mind running around town or going out at night with this phone. It is by far my favorite phone to date, even when stacked against all the flagships I've owned. Pros: -way better build quality over 1st gen (the loose backplate and light leakage are absolutely gone) -4.5"" a nice form factor, exceptionally nice to use with one hand, esp with Moto ergos -excellent real world battery life due to low res screen and big battery -quick and clean vanilla UI (should get even better with 5.1) -*excellent* LTE bands for America+Canada (all of the Americas from what I understand) - getting 40-50 mbps down / 25 mbps up in my area on T-Mobile unlt'd -Snapdragon 410 actually feels faster than 400 in real world usage -bloody brilliant customer service (instant call/chat button in built in ""Help"" app) -price, obviously. (u could go with a chinese manufacturer but i guarantee you will not receive the same top notch customer service, LTE bands, best in industry software updates, or overall thoughtful design.) -microSD capacity: load this bad boy up with a 64GB/128GB puppy and get cracked out on beats or whatever u do with ur offline storage Cons: -light sensor finicky in total darkness (also the case on my Moto G 2nd Gen) [edit: this was fixed in the 5.1 update] -no HDMI out, Chromecast not currently optimized for taking advantage of superb LTE connection -no LED flash/torch Overall, a very nice phone that punches well above its weight and truly does 90% of what flagships can do for an eighth of the cost. If you want a phone for decent multitasking for daily tasks, while you're on the move, look no further. I got used to the qHD res pretty fast and for most purposes it's way more than livable, thanks to decent colors, brightness, and viewing angles. If you want to consume lots of video.. until Google gets Chromecast working with a direct LTE connection, maybe go with a Nexus 6. For the money though, this is a way smarter iPhone 4S alternative. (Recommended especially for ABG's that end up getting smashed and smashing/losing their flagship phones. Srsly idk how y'all do that to $600 phones. Just.

15653,B075SKYZXY,A.I.,5,17-Jan-18,True,Moto Z2 Force,"I would highly recommend this phone. It's faster than Samsung Galaxy S8 at half the price. The OLED screen is very colorful, dual cameras are nice (color and black-and-white), battery life is surprisingly good, and it charges very fast, faster than any other phone, based on my experience, even with a regular charger. Although it doesn't have the edge-to-edge display like some of the latest phones, it looks premium and expensive even with the case on. The 'shatter-proof' plastic screen does need a screen protector cause it scratches easily (you only notice the scratches when the phone is turned off). The phone takes a Nano SIM card and this particular model (Lunar Gray) is for T-Mobile only. I'm thinking about getting a battery mod, which would double the battery life.

The unlocked version has no sign of an update anytime soon, Google some forums and see how mad the unlocked Z owners are. We're still on a security patch that's more that 6 months old while the droid versions are going on their third 7.0 update.

This is the first phone that I have owned that does not support screen casting to a Roku. My old Nexus 5 did as well as my Moto X Pure (2015). 2. Small battery. I know this is touted as the thinnest phone available, so it cost battery size in order to accommodate the thinner sideview. Also, there is no wireless charging unless you add the extended battery mod. 3. If you want to protect your phone with an armor case, then you cannot use a mod. 4. No headphone jack. It does come with an adapter to plug headphones into the Micro C charging port. So, you cannot charge phone and use standard headphones simultaneously. 5. No cable provided to link phone with PC. You must purchase separately. 6. Last but not least, support from Lenovo is deplorable. The Retail US edition of the Moto Z as of now (Jan 17, 2017) still has not received the Android Nougat update. In addition, this phone was released in October 2016 with the July 2016 security update, and as of today, still has not been updated. Lenovo stated that updates were starting to roll out in November, but nothing in Retail US yet. Calling support is of no help, they just tell you they are waiting for carrier review on an unlocked phone.

The phone does not have stereo speakers despite its appearance, but the sound quality is still extremely loud and clear. The matte black finish is quite smooth, soft, and pleasant to hold. As a Motorola phone, this phone should receive quick updates to the newest version of android extremely quickly. Furthermore, the operating system is not full of bloatware that Samsung and LG install with the phone, but rather a few apps that allow for hands-free gestures and other shortcuts. These apps can be easily disabled at the users discretion, but I find them extremely useful. One thing that should be pointed out it that this phone DOES NOT have full support for T-Mobile's network.

Finally, I managed to stumble upon the correct button combo to reboot it. Oh, happy day! So what if I messed with it so long it made me late for work? I thought this was a one off thing. I hadn't downloaded any apps at that point or done anything unusual to or with my phone. (By the way, the instructions for rebooting the phone are no I the paper guides they give you with the phone. To get that information you'd have to go online to look up the user's guide at Motorola. ) At any rate, this has happened 3 more times in the last week. I plug it in to charge, pick it up to check the charge or to use it, and it's completely unresponsive. I looked in various online forums and see I am not alone. I am using the Motorola charger and following all the protocols for use and charging. There is nothing I am doing to cause the phone to need to be rebooted 4 times in 7 days.

26193,B07WSJYDXX,MikeCPI,4,17-Dec-18,True,Very good replacement for my much loved Moto G4,"When my beloved by aging Moto G4 began needing a second daily recharge for heavier use and seemed to run hot more frequently than in the past, I decided to take advantage of a recent sale and purchased a Moto G6. It is a solid phone with seemingly better battery life and faster functioning out of the box that the G4. The things I most appreciated abuot the older phone remain - bright screen, clear resolution and snappy response. Transfer of my Android database was fairly complete. Some apps had to re-installed manually. One game ""Free Flow"" did not transfer its history when re-in stalled, in part because the new Moto G6 was pure Moto. The G4 had was purchased as an Amazon Prime phone. Day to day operation is very similar overall. One quibble: The Moto G6 reversed the positioning of the power and volume buttons on the right side of the phone. The power button is now on the bottom of the three button stack. Not intuitive. Several weeks out I'm still getting used to that. The camera is improved and low light photos are less grainy. The volume seems a bit brighter. Calls are clear. Blocking numbers from spam calls is simple. Turbo charging seems about 25% faster. With my normal use (messaging, occasional calls and checking news and weather, GPS for trips to new locations) I usually can go a day and a half before a recharge becomes essential. The other issues with the phone lie in the transition from Android 7 (Nougat) to Android 8 (Oreo). I had to manually set my notifications and other preferences as they did not transfer. The notification tone Pollux was not available on Android 8. I had to download it manually. I do not care for the smaller round icons and there is no way within the settings to change their appearance. Also some of the app widgets do not center on the screen and there appears no way to adjust them. On the plus side, app updates seem to process much faster. Messaging is improved as well. To sum up: I love the phone overall - it's light, well-built and a great value for the money. I'm still getting used to Android 8 and the button reconfiguration, but I would buy it again.",8.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

It can be used but the advanced features of the service are not available. The standard Moto G6 must be used. The Moto G6 ""Play"" trades a few features (such as a less elaborate camera) and slightly reduced processor performance for an oversized battery and much greater battery life compared to the regular G6 (which generally gets poor marks for battery life). In typical phone use, you can expect around 6 days on the battery. Of course, using GPS navigation or watching videos is going to reduce that a lot. They seem to have designed it with the idea that you could run it more or less continuously for a day on one charge but I have not tested this. Like all of the Motorola phones, it has excellent audio on the earphone jack; good enough to justify high-end earphones. Output is a little low for connection to an external amplifier. A Bluetooth adapter works better for that. Cases intended for the regular G6 do not work with this phone. It needs a case designed for it.

9803,B01LEL8ABY,Amazon Customer,4,17-Dec-16,False,"Well, if this is the best they have...","I have owned my droid for 3 or 4 months. It was a step down in utility, for me, as my primary concern as a product offering was ruggedness-and not just screen ruggedness. (There just are not any out there since the Casio Commando.) It feels to me very flimsy, as do all the big screen phones, & due to its thinness & larger size it is awkward to hold on to, with gloves, even with a case-as again-are all of the large screen ""thinner is better"" leaning phones. I put better than a 1 inch scratch the screen the first day I had it-(Tough it is not.) it was in my pocket, with my keys-oh well-(This never never happened with the commando& I had it for over 5 years-but lesson learned. Seriously, for a $700.00 phone-this lack of durability is weak-really pretty crappy-(I mean, this isn't supposed to be an apple phone-the wife went through 3 apple phones in the time that I had my commando). I then installed the recommended & over priced glass screen protector-which of course, -(yeah, it certainly is glass) cracked when the phone was dropped on its edge. I will never buy a glass screen protector again). For people who use the phone as a phone, and I do-the battery life is AWESOME, at least for me. I routinely get a day and a half out of it, before battery charge gets down into low 'teens. The camera is more than adequate for photos-(PS-if the resolution is disappointing-get over it-it is a phone that has a camera feature, it is NOT a camera-but for the price...). Of course, I don't play the games, or stream videos, or surf the web much-of which this phone will do, so that likely explains my battery life. I have the hot spot option, which is a necessary evil for me. I cannot complain about that either, it is great too. Even with two bars of signal strength, Ookla speed test shows a 24 gig download speed-much better than what I pay for at home, and cheaper too All in all, it stops short of being a ""great"" phone for me, as it is to delicate, as they all are these days, seemingly.

The droid turbo is the best of the best even into the mid year of 2015 with all the new devices out there since the maxx. However the maxx beats them all for everyday drivers when the newer models are not as important to you. I like my maxx better than them all due to simple basic things. The battery on the maxx gets better performance than all of them, the size is perfect, the 5.2 on the turbo is a tad to big, the 4.7 size is a tad to small no matter what phone. The 5.0 on the maxx is perfect not including the texture and feel can't be beat. Samsung and apple users will disagree completely however when you shop only for the name brands that is what you are going to see. I personally could care less on people's opinions or the manufactures, I spend my hard earned money on the best practical device and the maxx beats then all.

4482,B00MWI4HW0,T. Rodgers,4,16-Oct-14,True,"An excellent value, with few caveats","I've been using this phone as my driver for about two weeks now, so I think I can comment on how well it works for that purpose. It's a snappy little device that rarely slows down on me (but yes, it does slow down from time to time). I use a lot of apps and I haven't found one that it hasn't been able to run well yet. The device itself feels fairly solid, although it's a bit hefty, and the display looks far better than what you would expect in this price range. The somewhat low PPI is only visible is you look for it, or hold the device close. Having owned a Lumia 720 with Windows Phone 8.1 before this, I will say that I haven't found the switch to be (even slightly) jarring. There are specific features that I do miss (the Lumia camera apps, long battery life*, double tap screen to wake the phone), but others that I thought I would miss and didn't (Cortana**). In addition, I'm spoiled by wider selection of apps that are available for KitKat. *In terms of battery life, this phone is a disappointment. My expectations might be too high coming from the 720, but this thing can barely make it through the day before needing a charge. Sometimes, I'm reaching for the charger by 5pm (from around 6 or 7am). I tried turning off the WiFi when I'm not using it, setting the GPS in battery saving mode, and setting the screen to turn off after a very short period. **Google Now is a more than capable replacement for Cortana. While Google Now doesn't really do Cortana's chit chat, it can handle just about anything else that Cortana does. I'm very pleased with it. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low cost Android device that can handle your business. Pros: * Great value * Excellent app selection * Snappy performance 90% of the time * Not an eyesore Cons: * Disappointing battery life * The keyboard slows down occasionally, making it hard to type.",11.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-2nd-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4HW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OLIW5q0eL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4HW0,3,99.0,0.0

It is a bigger phone and as someone with small hands that can be rough but with a slim hardcase, it works well. Just be sure that if you buy a Moto Z, you buy a case immediately.

I gave the item a 3 star rating and that is really just for the phone. It's a great phone with better options then the version being sold here in the United States. It was very tempting to get an item better equipped and cheaper then what is sold for the US market. The item should probably not be sold to customers that are planning on using it here exclusively in the United States. The listing should state that. It is for GSM service only in those countries. I did call AT&T on this phone and gave them the specific numbers they needed to check compatibility. They advised me that it would work on their system. It appears even though it may work on GSM , it may not have the ability to connect to all bands that they use here in the United States.

The screen has gone from a 4.7""AMoled to a 5.2"" Amoled. Easier to see and still compact enough to fit into my Scottevest vest. The processing on this phone is much faster, instead of 5 seconds to go from the Motorola listening to the Google ready it does it in around a second. If you liked your MOTO X 1st Gen, you are going to love the 2nd Gen. Faster Bigger Screen The one two negatives aret hat the camera doesn't do well in low light conditions. Sigh... The second, very mild is that the headphone jack is proprietary to Motorola, you can use any headphone but if you need advanced uses of the buttons it doesn't have that feature. On the other side of the coin, the middle button works on headsets that are designed fro apple products. I think they've figured out how to make the phone more battery efficient because I'm getting good life watching youtube videos etc... Tip- I bought the unlocked GSM version directly from Motomaker [Arrived in 3 Days from China. Wow...] 32gb Memory included bought it for $200.00 delivered+ Tax, and am using it with gosmart wireless, a re-seller of t-mobile . T-mobile works great in Southern California.

5298,B00OZTSY6Y,Ebeck,1,16-May-15,False,24-48 Hr Battery? Try 4. Worst Battery Ever.,"I bought my turbo from the Verizon store over Christmas, & was told I had until the end of January to return due to the holiday season. I purchased the turbo solely for it's advertised 24-48 battery life, and 21 mega pixel camera. I immediately flew out of state to visit family for the holiday, which is also when I began using the phone. I immediately saw the phone last for maybe 4 hours .... if I was lucky. I wasn't immediately devastated, because I'd done my research before purchasing, and saw Motorola suggested giving the phone a few days of cycling through the battery before reaching its ""full potential"". In the meantime, my grandfather passed away (still during this trip) so I repeatedly extended my return date. I wasn't concerned about the turbo not making it past 4-6 hours still, because I had been quoted until the end of January to return it, AND, what company wouldn't understand a lemon when they heard these details, anyways? Combined with the unusual predicament I found myself in (which was provable by extrinsic evidence, no less). I returned home, devastated, and was able to get to the Verizon store two days past the 31st. Yes, I was late, but the phone was defective & my delay in returning it was not due to anything in my control. I had proof of my grandfather's death and funeral arrangements, and the travel arrangements and re-re arrangements, and was hoping the store would see the breach of of implied warranty of merchantability; the phone is mainly premised on it's 24-48 hr battery life, & I barely got 8% of that from day one, and it never improved, despite that whole cycling through crap. I didn't want not a different phone, or a return, but just what I paid for before I left town, & exactly what Motorola advertised the phone as doing: a new phone with a decent battery life. I hoped for 24, not 48, but honestly would have been happy to just make it home from work on the same charge. Nope. Totally nope. Not just Verizon, I went straight to Motorola. Citing the UCC, which protects consumers from this very thing, and includes both express and implied warranties of merchantability. I called. I write letters. I went in person. I had a legitimate dud, and was in an honest predicament, but they wouldn't replace my phone with another new turbo? The best I was offered by either Motorola or Verizon was a used turbo. Sometimes leftovers. They tried to polish it up by the whole ""refurbished"" title, but that doesn't change the fact that they sent me something that used to be in someone else's pocket and returned it after changing their mind, despite the fact that I'd just recently paid full price for a new phone, not a used one. If I'd wanted someone else's sloppy seconds, I'd surely have paid less for that. But that's what I got. I could only muster up so much energy for this argument on my phone. Despite knowing I was right, I had no choice. Without a removable battery, I couldn't be without a phone in operation. I gave in and accepted the used replacement. But the first used replacement wasn't much better. I am not an overly aggressive user. Sometimes I use the phone more than others, but there were mornings I didn't use it at all at work and was at 30% by 11. I don't understand. The phone is supposed to be 24-48. I tried having another sent to me, and had slightly better luck with the third turbo (second used one to replace my new one that was a lemon). This one made it to 6-7 hours sometimes, but only with super light use, so I tolerated it. I had to buy a small portable charger to carry in my purse, though, because it still would did at 4 hours sometimes. After two months it stopped taking a charge completely, and I just gave up completely and gave it back to Verizon, moving on from the painful experience with a huge ding in my pocketbook. Motorola used to be my favorite go to phone company, but they dumped me off to each other division and segment when I was seeking resolution with my initial lemon on this unfortunately marketed device. The camera may have been 21 pixels, but it had very few options to do anything with them, and given my battery situation, I never used anything I didn't desperately need to use anyway. My experience was so poor, I'm never touching another Motorola anything.

9735,B01LEL8ABY,Slap,5,16-Feb-17,True,"Excellent On AT&T, Android 7 Update Live","Initial Review: 2/16/2017 I will break this down as best as I can. To begin, I have AT&T and am coming from a Moto X Pure and before that, an HTC One M8. My Moto X Pure is still waiting for its Android 7 update. And after reading some of the reviews on here I was worried that Motorola just forgot about this device. However, as soon as I turned it on and logged on to my WiFi, I received an update notification for Android 7. I set up my phone first, installed and customized a few apps, and then updated, which took 10 minutes of time and 6% of my battery life. So there you have it. The Android 7 update is live on this device. The overall tactile feel of the phone is amazing. It comes with a wood magnetic backplate and a bumper cover which actually all look just fine when placed on the phone. I still ordered a new case...protection! You also get the usual manuals, a charger, and a small utility to pop open the SIM/memory card slot. Also included is a USB-C to headphone plug adapter, which is nice, but it should have a charge port built into that adapter as when it's plugged in, you cannot charge the phone. The phone looks great as well. I find the design very pleasing, although the bottom bezel protrudes a bit too far down and the camera kind of feels like I've got a rock stuck to the back of the phone lol. But these are things that don't bother me. What slightly bothers me is the removal of the headphone jack. I use Bluetooth headphones so I don't have a problem here, but it might be a major problem to others. And I strongly disagree with the decision by phone manufacturers to remove it. Screen:. Gorgeous screen. I believe it's an AMOLED screen so go figure. It has deep black levels and the viewing angles are good. And it's actually quite bright. I wasn't expecting that; my last phone with an AMOLED was my Galaxy S4 and that screen at its brightest was about 1/3 of the brightness of this. I tested it in the sun today and at higher brightness levels, it is easily readable in sunlight. Comparing this screen to the one on the Moto X Pure, I'd honestly have to give it to the X Pure. Things are just ever-so slightly sharper, and I feel the colors are more accurate. Connectivity: I get about the same signal strength on GSM/LTE as I did with my X Pure, which was better than my HTC M8. WiFi is really fast, Bluetooth works well, etc. Everything here works just about as good as one would expect, at least on AT&T. UI: The UI is superb. It's clean, simple, and extremely fast. This is where the phone makes its night and day difference to me. It is ridiculously faster than my Moto X Pure in almost every way: opening apps, browsing the web, general usage. I'll also include bloatware here. No carrier bloatware which is amazing and there isn't much preloaded to begin with. It's pretty clean. Sound: Not as loud as my Moto X Pure or my HTC M8. Both of those phones have dual front-firing speakers which make watching videos or listening to music a very pleasant experience. Sound quality from the speaker is also pretty average. I feel Motorola could have done a little more work here. I've got the call volume maxed and I have very good hearing, but I still find it needs more of a boost. Battery Life: The jury is still out but it feels pretty close to my X Pure right now. That phone has a 3000mah battery compared to 2600mah on the Z. I will update this as I get more information. Camera: Eh. So the camera on my Moto X Pure is over 20 MP (4:3), 16 MP (16:9). The camera on the Z is about 10 MP (16:9). I have yet to take pictures and compare the two but on paper, the camera on the X may best the camera on the Z - will update.",9.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

You probably know it does not have a flash, but what is left out of most spec lists is that it has no internal compass. So if you use it for e.g. GPS, it has no idea which way you are pointed until you start moving (really annoying when you are trying to navigate out of a parking lot in the right direction). As far as software goes, though, this phone is more p0wned than unlocked: 1) If you don't want it to use your wifi location (which implies sending your location to Google continuously), then every single time you enable the GPS it will nag you to let use it use wifi-phone-Google. And if you accidentally allow it, IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY OPTION TO TURN IT OFF. 2) Don't want to enable background data because you pay per MB? Hope you like the nag notification constantly at the top of your screen 3) Want to use cell data you are paying for already? Too bad, the phone will taint your tethered data so the carrier knows it is not from the phone. This is a supposed to be an UNLOCKED phone, thanks Google. (""Don't be evil?""

22731,B07NP2Y82Q,pseudonym,5,16-Apr-19,False,"Excellent value, Good speakers, Good camera","EDIT: The Moto G7 Plus works on AT&T and the companies which use their cell towers, such as Consumer Cellular (including LTE bands) and T-Mobile (possibly not 4G or LTE bands). However, this being an International model, there is no factory warranty in the US. The Moto G7+ takes advantage of major improvements that have been made over recent years in major flagship phones and is able to leverage a good chunk of that technology at a much lower price. At the same time it's not marketed to the people that would necessarily buy a flagship phone, so it still contains certain features that you would more likely find in a mid-range phone, such as a headphone jack. I have using the Moto G7+ for about 2 weeks, and I am impressed with it. Previous to that I used a Sony compact phone since late 2017. Needless to say, the size of the G7+ took a bit of getting used to, and I find I occasionally miss the ability to do simple things easily with one hand. A few things I’ve noticed: The G7+ has very good speakers (i.e. loud and not tinny or distorted). One is front-facing, and the other, louder one is at the bottom, so in typical use they balance pretty well. The screen is bright enough with good viewing angles. Good WiFi; seems the range is better than other recent phones I've tried. Fine, clear calls and excellent speakerphone function. I’ve only tried the camera a bit but it seems like it works pretty well and is very quick to focus. In particular, the zoom function is very smooth, and even at high zoom the results are nowhere near as *blocky* as what my previous phones have often produced. The camera interface is simple, with a ring you can move on the screen to specify subject for autofocus/exposure. I've gotten best results leaving HDR on *auto* or always on. I have not had any problems with battery lasting the whole day, but then again I'm someone who most of the time is able to top it up at various different points during the day. As a result it probably never gets below 50% or so. If I find myself in a situation where I would not be able to charge the phone from an outlet, I would probably take along a small cell charger until I know how the phone would fare in such a situation. By the way, I have not yet even tried once the 27 watt charger that comes with the phone, as I have no reason to charge that quickly, and I'm suspicious that charging that rapidly is going to be bad for the battery itself. The phone's ability to connect to the various different Bluetooth devices I have is very good. Occasionally, on re-connection, the Bluetooth receiver in my car gets its data scrambled so that the file data, such as time played and time remaining, is inaccurate or missing. But that happens on occasion with just about any phone I’ve tried. Using Chromecast, I haven't encountered so much as a skip or a dropout. Yay! As appears to be common to many phones, there is only a single volume slider for both ring and notification volume in the settings- you can't adjust them separately. But, seemingly only on this Moto phone (that I know of), there seems to be a limiter on *only* the notification volume. I can set the volume of the notification/ring in the Settings, but, *in actual use*, the notification tone (but not the ring tone) is much quieter, about half of what it should be. Weird. In general, I miss the ability to adjust all volumes without going into the Settings - that seems to be new to Android Pie, and not just the G7+. I do wish that there was an LED notification lamp. The remaining battery charge percentage is shown in an extremely tiny icon (I think it’s just the usual system modification previously made available under Developer Options), and it would be better if the number were shown by itself elsewhere on the status bar (which is largely empty to the left of the notch). I know that I could use the peek/glance screen, but I found that it activated at odd times, unexpectedly, which became a distraction. So I disabled it.

The kicker to this phone, and what nets 2 stars despite a great review, after 6 months of owning it the battery started to show signs of cell degradation. Battery would last less, it started shutting off with 40 percent battery remaining ect. I did a clean reset, it still did it. 2 months later i couldn't use the phone without it being plugged in to my back up battery.

22774,B07NP6R2RG,mondele,3,15-Oct-19,True,One of the best values in a Chinese-made phone.,"My last Moto phone is my best Moto phone. I won't buy another because of Hong Kong and Uighurs, but this is a very nice phone. It has the Moto gestures that I've come to rely on: shake for flashlight, twist for camera. It has a great battery life (although I still thrash it), it has a huge 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, plus handles my 128GB SD card with no issues. Unlike my Moto G(5) phone from Costa Rica, this one has a magnetometer (digital compass) which is needed by some apps. The speaker is loud, loUD, LOUD, and Android 9 is actually pretty nice. I unlocked the bootloader, but now am wondering if it was even necessary, since the hotspot feature works, even though I haven't tweaked anything. The dual sims are housed in a tray that has a third spot for the SD card, and it can be removed and inserted without taking the phone apart or even shutting it down. (Battery isn't removable, but that hasn't been a problem, so far. Signal is pretty good on AT&T here in the boonies — probably better than the G(5). In short, if you're on AT&T and want a dual-sim phone with big memory and big battery, you could do a lot worse for your money than this guy. On the other hand, if you care about the Uighurs and Hong Kong, you might want to shop for a Korean or Taiwanese phone. Yes, I could probably still send this one back and start shopping for another one, but I'm choosing not to.

5357,B00OZTSY6Y,Quentin Moore,5,15-Nov-14,False,Best... Phone... Ever........,"I owned the original Samsung Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note 2. I skipped the Note 3 mostly because I didn't have any available upgrades on my family plan ;-). Plus I figured I'd skip a generation and get a much better Note. I purchased the Note 4, thought it was great, and then promptly returned it. ""Why"", do you ask? The answer is simple... ================================================= THE DROID TURBO IS THE BEST PHONE KNOWN TO MAN! ================================================= Before you kill me for saying this, hear me out. I'm not a fan boy. I don't work for Motorola. I've tried a number of the current flagship phones before deciding on the Turbo. Here are some of my thoughts on the other phones: - I tried the Note 4, thought it was great, and returned it. - I have the iPhone 6 Plus, loved it, planned to keep it, tried the Turbo, and now I'm looking to sell the 6 Plus. - I also owned the HTC ONE M8 for Windows, thought it was cool, was pleasantly surprised when it started reading text messages to me automatically while I was driving, but I returned it as I was worried about the ecosystem. - I briefly got my hands on the Nexus 6. Thought it was great. Was happy to see that it was made by Motorola, and was then quickly disappointed that it was missing the Motorola Apps and features found on the Moto X and Droid Turbo. In my opinion, the combination of great specs, a great screen, blistering performance, slap your momma long battery life, and most importantly, the unique suite of Moto Apps firmly places the Droid Turbo ahead of all other smartphones. ✔ PROS: - Very nice screen - Fast Performance - Good (not great) camera - Double twist your wrist to launch the camera - The mother of all batteries (MOAB) - Trusted Devices: Keep your phone unlocked when it's near a trusted device (headset, fitness band, etc.) - Moto Voice: The Turbo is always listening for your commands, allowing you to use your phone without touching it - Moto Assist: The Turbo knows when you are home and allows you to accept/reject phone calls via verbal commands. When you are home or when you are driving, the Turbo allows you to hear and respond to text messages via verbal commands. The Turbo will also silence your phone during meetings - Moto Actions: Sensors detect hand gestures to let you activate your phone's screen without touching it. You can use this to see the current time, preview notifications, or wave off incoming calls - Moto Display: See notifications on your phone without touching the phone. You can preview and act on notification from the lock screen - Customizable ""Hello Google"", hands free voice command phrase. - Accurate voice recognition courtesy of an included secondary chip dedicated to natural language processing - Qi wireless charging support. Just buy a $20 wireless charger and you're set. - Turbo Charger support (get 8 hours of charge in only 15 minutes) - Very close to stock Android 4.4. In the past, Motorola has provided quick Android OS updates to its phones. - Cheaper than a Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus (sans incentives, trade-in offers, etc.) - Solid, sturdy build. There won't be an iPhone 6 Plus type ""Bend-Gate"" for the Turbo. ✔ CONS: - You won't get the advertised 48 hours of battery life - Camera has slow autofocus (after you use the iPhone 6 Plus, you notice slow autofocus much more) - Camera doesn't have optical image stabilization (WHY???!?!?!?!?1?ONE!?) - There's a slight delay between when the Turbo hears your hands-free voice command and when it performas the action - Volumes button are a tad flush to the body and takes a wee bit more effort to local them - Only one speaker - Phone can get warm to the touch - No available option for a larger screen that includes Moto Apps and the dedicated natural language chip - No SD Card slot - No fitness tracking related sensors - Mobile hotspot didn't work for a couple days after launch but it works now. - Simultaneous voice and data doesn't work at the time of this writing but should be added in a month or so. ✔ OTHER - The Turbo was incorrectly reporting my location initially. It was saying I was in Washington, DC when I was actually in Virginia. I changed a setting (I don't remember which) and now it's fixed. - I like the nylon cover, although I suspect some people might not - It has dedicated capacitive buttons, not on screen buttons. I prefer dedicated buttons, but I wish the home button was a physical button, like on the Note 4. - The phone is water resistant, (NOT WATERPROOF!). - It's only available on Verizon (for now). We'll have to see if the rumored Droid Maxx and Moto X Play have the same specs and features. - Some users complain about call volume. I haven't experienced this issue. ✔ USING THE DROID TURBO Here are some of the things I've done with the Turbo and why I think it's cool: - I can initiate a voice search without touching the Turbo. Yes, you can do this with many Android phones but on the Turbo, you can customize the command. For example, my launch phrase is ""Eagle One, come in!"" Since the Turbo has a dedicated, low power natural language processing chip, the launch command works more reliably on the Turbo that any other non-Motorola phone. Since the Turbo has a huge battery, you can leave this feature on and still get over a day of battery life. - Turbo knows when I am home. If I'm home when a call comes in, Turbo will say the name of the caller and ask me if I want to take the call. If I say ""listen"", Turbo will answer the call on speaker phone. If I say ""ignore"", Turbo will end the call. If the ignored caller has a mobile number in my contact list, Turbo will ask if I want to send the caller a text message. I can then speak my message to Turbo and Turbo will send it. I can do all of this without touching the Turbo. - Turbo will also announce incoming text messages when I'm home. I can listen to and reply to text messages without touching Turbo. - Turbo knows when I'm driving (or on a bus or train) and will also announce incoming text messages when I'm on the move. - A few times in the past couple of weeks I have taken calls from bed without getting out of bed. The Turbo can hear commands from across a room. - I've taken calls from the Turbo while sitting down, with the phone in my pocket. - I've participated in long text message threads with people while cooking dinner, all without touching my Turbo. The dedicated natural language processing chip rarely misunderstands what I am saying. - Need to take a quick photo? Twist your wrist twice while holding the Turbo to launch the camera app. You don't even have to unlock your phone. - Hate having to unlock your phone all the time? Feeling envious of Apple's fast and accurate Touch ID? Use Trusted Devices on the Turbo. With this functionality, you can keep your Turbo unlocked whenever it's connected to a trusted Bluetooth device you designate. This can be a BT headset, your car, or even your BT equipped home computer. I use my Microsoft Band as my trusted device. Yes, using Trusted Devices is a bit risky as someone can access your phone if your trusted device is nearby. - The big battery allows me to no longer do anything to preserve battery life. No more battery saving apps, no more turning apps off, no more turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Just leave everything on, bro. And since the Turbo has wireless charging built-in, if buy a couple of $20 wireless charging pads for the home, the car, and the office, your Turbo will never run out of power. ✔ DROID TURBO vs SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4 The Note 4 has a better camera that includes OIS, a larger screen, and stylus pen support (a great advantage if you actually learn to use the pen). The Turbo has a turbo charger, built-in wireless charging, and a larger battery. The Turbo also has Moto Apps. I think more people will use the Moto Apps than they will use the Note 4 stylus pen. ✔ DROID TURBO vs IPHONE 6 PLUS The iPhone 6 Plus has the best total camera experience on any smartphone, plus a larger screen. The 6 Plus also has the best ecosystem (apps, accessories, iTunes, enterprise support, desktop integration, mind share, etc.). Unless you are heavily invested in iTunes purchases or need the best smartphone camera, I think you should switch platforms. Moto Apps are just that good. Plus the 6 Plus lacks the big battery, turbo charging, and wireless charging. ✔ DROID TURBO vs GOOGLE NEXUS 6 The Nexus 6 ships with Android 5.0 and can expect to get Android OS updates the quickest. The N6 has a larger screen and dual speakers. Its camera features a ring flash, OIS, and HDR+. If Motorola's past performance is an indicator, the Turbo can expected to get Android updates pretty quick, nerfing one of the N6's big advantages. Since Motorola makes both the N6 and the Turbo, I don't anticipate the Turbo will get updates much later than the N6. If the N6 had Moto Apps, the dedicated voice chip, and a bigger battery, I would get the N6. The N6 doesn't have these things so, to me, it loses to the Turbo. ✔ BOTTOM LINE The Droid Turbo is the best phone available. Period. It has a great screen, blistering performance, and the best battery life. Its suite of Moto Apps destroys everything running on any other phone. While it's true that its camera is not as good as the Big 3 (Note 4, Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus), the camera isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, just not as good as the Big 3 cameras. I know I'm not crazy in writing this review. Several tech journalist have already suggested that the Moto X is the best Android phone available. Google ""moto x best phone ever"" and see for yourself. The Droid Turbo is a Moto X with a bigger battery, better camera, faster CPU, better screen, and more RAM. Thus, The Turbo is better than the ""best Android phone ever"". ;-) Rarely have I enjoyed using a phone so much that I would recommend people to switch platforms and even switch carriers to get the phone! The Turbo is that good. While other flagship phones provide largely the same user experience, the Turbo gives you a whole lot more. Of course, if you don't think you will make great use of the Moto Apps and the big battery, or if you need a bigger screen, you can't go wrong with the Note 4, Nexus 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. At the end of the day, these are all great phones.

5347,B00OZTSY6Y,Quentin Moore,5,15-Nov-14,False,Best... Phone... Ever........,"I owned the original Samsung Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note 2. I skipped the Note 3 mostly because I didn't have any available upgrades on my family plan ;-). Plus I figured I'd skip a generation and get a much better Note. I purchased the Note 4, thought it was great, and then promptly returned it. ""Why"", do you ask? The answer is simple... ================================================= THE DROID TURBO IS THE BEST PHONE KNOWN TO MAN! ================================================= Before you kill me for saying this, hear me out. I'm not a fan boy. I don't work for Motorola. I've tried a number of the current flagship phones before deciding on the Turbo. Here are some of my thoughts on the other phones: - I tried the Note 4, thought it was great, and returned it. - I have the iPhone 6 Plus, loved it, planned to keep it, tried the Turbo, and now I'm looking to sell the 6 Plus. - I also owned the HTC ONE M8 for Windows, thought it was cool, was pleasantly surprised when it started reading text messages to me automatically while I was driving, but I returned it as I was worried about the ecosystem. - I briefly got my hands on the Nexus 6. Thought it was great. Was happy to see that it was made by Motorola, and was then quickly disappointed that it was missing the Motorola Apps and features found on the Moto X and Droid Turbo. In my opinion, the combination of great specs, a great screen, blistering performance, slap your momma long battery life, and most importantly, the unique suite of Moto Apps firmly places the Droid Turbo ahead of all other smartphones. ✔ PROS: - Very nice screen - Fast Performance - Good (not great) camera - Double twist your wrist to launch the camera - The mother of all batteries (MOAB) - Trusted Devices: Keep your phone unlocked when it's near a trusted device (headset, fitness band, etc.) - Moto Voice: The Turbo is always listening for your commands, allowing you to use your phone without touching it - Moto Assist: The Turbo knows when you are home and allows you to accept/reject phone calls via verbal commands. When you are home or when you are driving, the Turbo allows you to hear and respond to text messages via verbal commands. The Turbo will also silence your phone during meetings - Moto Actions: Sensors detect hand gestures to let you activate your phone's screen without touching it. You can use this to see the current time, preview notifications, or wave off incoming calls - Moto Display: See notifications on your phone without touching the phone. You can preview and act on notification from the lock screen - Customizable ""Hello Google"", hands free voice command phrase. - Accurate voice recognition courtesy of an included secondary chip dedicated to natural language processing - Qi wireless charging support. Just buy a $20 wireless charger and you're set. - Turbo Charger support (get 8 hours of charge in only 15 minutes) - Very close to stock Android 4.4. In the past, Motorola has provided quick Android OS updates to its phones. - Cheaper than a Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus (sans incentives, trade-in offers, etc.) - Solid, sturdy build. There won't be an iPhone 6 Plus type ""Bend-Gate"" for the Turbo. ✔ CONS: - You won't get the advertised 48 hours of battery life - Camera has slow autofocus (after you use the iPhone 6 Plus, you notice slow autofocus much more) - Camera doesn't have optical image stabilization (WHY???!?!?!?!?1?ONE!?) - There's a slight delay between when the Turbo hears your hands-free voice command and when it performas the action - Volumes button are a tad flush to the body and takes a wee bit more effort to local them - Only one speaker - Phone can get warm to the touch - No available option for a larger screen that includes Moto Apps and the dedicated natural language chip - No SD Card slot - No fitness tracking related sensors - Mobile hotspot didn't work for a couple days after launch but it works now. - Simultaneous voice and data doesn't work at the time of this writing but should be added in a month or so. ✔ OTHER - The Turbo was incorrectly reporting my location initially. It was saying I was in Washington, DC when I was actually in Virginia. I changed a setting (I don't remember which) and now it's fixed. - I like the nylon cover, although I suspect some people might not - It has dedicated capacitive buttons, not on screen buttons. I prefer dedicated buttons, but I wish the home button was a physical button, like on the Note 4. - The phone is water resistant, (NOT WATERPROOF!). - It's only available on Verizon (for now). We'll have to see if the rumored Droid Maxx and Moto X Play have the same specs and features. - Some users complain about call volume. I haven't experienced this issue. ✔ USING THE DROID TURBO Here are some of the things I've done with the Turbo and why I think it's cool: - I can initiate a voice search without touching the Turbo. Yes, you can do this with many Android phones but on the Turbo, you can customize the command. For example, my launch phrase is ""Eagle One, come in!"" Since the Turbo has a dedicated, low power natural language processing chip, the launch command works more reliably on the Turbo that any other non-Motorola phone. Since the Turbo has a huge battery, you can leave this feature on and still get over a day of battery life. - Turbo knows when I am home. If I'm home when a call comes in, Turbo will say the name of the caller and ask me if I want to take the call. If I say ""listen"", Turbo will answer the call on speaker phone. If I say ""ignore"", Turbo will end the call. If the ignored caller has a mobile number in my contact list, Turbo will ask if I want to send the caller a text message. I can then speak my message to Turbo and Turbo will send it. I can do all of this without touching the Turbo. - Turbo will also announce incoming text messages when I'm home. I can listen to and reply to text messages without touching Turbo. - Turbo knows when I'm driving (or on a bus or train) and will also announce incoming text messages when I'm on the move. - A few times in the past couple of weeks I have taken calls from bed without getting out of bed. The Turbo can hear commands from across a room. - I've taken calls from the Turbo while sitting down, with the phone in my pocket. - I've participated in long text message threads with people while cooking dinner, all without touching my Turbo. The dedicated natural language processing chip rarely misunderstands what I am saying. - Need to take a quick photo? Twist your wrist twice while holding the Turbo to launch the camera app. You don't even have to unlock your phone. - Hate having to unlock your phone all the time? Feeling envious of Apple's fast and accurate Touch ID? Use Trusted Devices on the Turbo. With this functionality, you can keep your Turbo unlocked whenever it's connected to a trusted Bluetooth device you designate. This can be a BT headset, your car, or even your BT equipped home computer. I use my Microsoft Band as my trusted device. Yes, using Trusted Devices is a bit risky as someone can access your phone if your trusted device is nearby. - The big battery allows me to no longer do anything to preserve battery life. No more battery saving apps, no more turning apps off, no more turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Just leave everything on, bro. And since the Turbo has wireless charging built-in, if buy a couple of $20 wireless charging pads for the home, the car, and the office, your Turbo will never run out of power. ✔ DROID TURBO vs SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4 The Note 4 has a better camera that includes OIS, a larger screen, and stylus pen support (a great advantage if you actually learn to use the pen). The Turbo has a turbo charger, built-in wireless charging, and a larger battery. The Turbo also has Moto Apps. I think more people will use the Moto Apps than they will use the Note 4 stylus pen. ✔ DROID TURBO vs IPHONE 6 PLUS The iPhone 6 Plus has the best total camera experience on any smartphone, plus a larger screen. The 6 Plus also has the best ecosystem (apps, accessories, iTunes, enterprise support, desktop integration, mind share, etc.). Unless you are heavily invested in iTunes purchases or need the best smartphone camera, I think you should switch platforms. Moto Apps are just that good. Plus the 6 Plus lacks the big battery, turbo charging, and wireless charging. ✔ DROID TURBO vs GOOGLE NEXUS 6 The Nexus 6 ships with Android 5.0 and can expect to get Android OS updates the quickest. The N6 has a larger screen and dual speakers. Its camera features a ring flash, OIS, and HDR+. If Motorola's past performance is an indicator, the Turbo can expected to get Android updates pretty quick, nerfing one of the N6's big advantages. Since Motorola makes both the N6 and the Turbo, I don't anticipate the Turbo will get updates much later than the N6. If the N6 had Moto Apps, the dedicated voice chip, and a bigger battery, I would get the N6. The N6 doesn't have these things so, to me, it loses to the Turbo. ✔ BOTTOM LINE The Droid Turbo is the best phone available. Period. It has a great screen, blistering performance, and the best battery life. Its suite of Moto Apps destroys everything running on any other phone. While it's true that its camera is not as good as the Big 3 (Note 4, Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus), the camera isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, just not as good as the Big 3 cameras. I know I'm not crazy in writing this review. Several tech journalist have already suggested that the Moto X is the best Android phone available. Google ""moto x best phone ever"" and see for yourself. The Droid Turbo is a Moto X with a bigger battery, better camera, faster CPU, better screen, and more RAM. Thus, The Turbo is better than the ""best Android phone ever"". ;-) Rarely have I enjoyed using a phone so much that I would recommend people to switch platforms and even switch carriers to get the phone! The Turbo is that good. While other flagship phones provide largely the same user experience, the Turbo gives you a whole lot more. Of course, if you don't think you will make great use of the Moto Apps and the big battery, or if you need a bigger screen, you can't go wrong with the Note 4, Nexus 6, or iPhone 6 Plus. At the end of the day, these are all great phones.

My g4 charging port broke right out of the year warranty and it bricked. I preordered this G5S Plus, I had network connectivity issues (Well documented, check online).... Support blamed it on my apps and had me reset them, it did not fix the problem. After 7 months the main in call phone speaker stopped working. Motorola initially offered to replace the phone under warranty then quickly took back their offer because my phone had a small crack in the bottom corner. THE MOTOROLA REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PHONE EVEN ADMITTED THAT THERE IS ALMOST NO CHANCE THAT THE SMALL CRACK CAUSED THESE ISSUES. However, because of this unrelated crack that does not affect functionality they said i would need to pay $100 to get their phone's issues fixed. They lowered their ""fix it"" price to $60, which is still unacceptable for a warranty repair. Connectivity issue: Phone calls intermittently do not come through, even if the phone is showing good service from my carrier (AT&T). The phone will not ring, callers will typically hear two or three rings before it goes to voicemail. My phone will randomly get voicemails minutes or hours later from these callers. This is obviously not ideal as having a phone so unreliable can be a real issue if emergencies pop up. Speaker issue: main in-call phone speaker is crackily, high pitched, and very low volume.

4552,B00MWI4KKE,Arindam Das,3,15-May-17,False,"Some of the quick access like shaking it to open camera was very useful, notifications on lock screen is nice","I am using this phone around 1.5 years now. First year, its performance overall was satisfying. Some positives are: Android updates came fast and consistently. Some of the quick access like shaking it to open camera was very useful. Screen brightness and performance of apps and not-so-hungry games were just fine. Speaker is great. Camera is o.k in good light condition..low-light/indoor shots are not good, specially in comparison to Samsung/Apple products of similar or higher price range. Major problem is battery and volume buttons. After a year, battery performance degraded drastically...now, I need to carry pocket juice every. It even does not last 2 hours of screen time. More over, you can not replace the battery as it is in-built. Also, after showing alert of 10% battery left, it snaps without giving you any time to plug it to power. Also, I face frequent issue of automatic reboot and no response or black screen when battery drains. In that case, you can charge it eirther easily unless you apply certain tricks like holding the volume button for couple of seconds, opting for factory mode and then pressing both volume and power button together...sounds confusing and scary...well, this is discussed in may online forum. So, if you are tech savvy, you can find your way out...but if it is with your mom/dad, they may have to throw it away. Volume button is bad and stopped working after a year. Now, I need to use settings to change my volume...pretty frustrating.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) XT1097 GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4KKE,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HfPVitlfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4KKE,428,0.0,0.0

22722,B07NP2Y82Q,Paul,3,15-Jun-19,True,Perfect $300 phone except for this one BIG issue (loses two stars),"Replaced my LG G5 phone 30 days ago with this phone after hours of studying all the options. Wanted a $300 phone so that if I don't like it after a couple years (or it is lost/stolen), I will buy another $300 phone. I am a heavy phone user for business, audio books, Spotify and reading news. I don't game at all. PROS: This is almost as nice as my $800 Galaxy Note 5 (the phone previous to the LG). The large screen size is a dream. Resolution is superb. Speed is excellent (at least for a 30-day old device). Fingerprint reader works 97% of the time. Facial recognition unlock works great too. The battery is too small to get through 24 hours of use, but the fast-charge is LIGHTNING FAST! Wow. About 3% charge rate per minute. A 10 or 20 minute mid-day charge and you're set. Picture quality is very good. CONS: I think this is an Android 9 (pie) glitch because other phone manufacturers are reporting similar problems. The volume adjustment is unreliable. The problem is intermittent, maybe 15% of the time, but it has caused me problems with clients calling or slow response to messages until I look at the phone. I have it set to full volume to hear calls or text, the device is right next to me and I never hear anything. At first I thought it was me. Eventually after enough missed calls and texts I realized it was a phone problem. Did extensive research (Amazon and Android forums) and found many folks with the same problem. There are fixes, but nothing seems to universally work for everyone. Reinstalling the phone sometimes works and then adding apps manually one at a time. I think it is an Android problem, and possibly related to permissions granted to other apps to adjust the volume (i.e. spotify, Audible, messaging apps, Zedge,...). I check my phone several times and day and make a volume change for Media Volume, Call Volume, Ring Volume, and Alarm Volume. If I could fix this issue, I would rate this phone 5 stars because it delivers so much bang-for-the-buck. I will update this review if I can resolve the volume problem.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G7+ Plus (64GB, 4GB RAM) Dual SIM 6.2"" 4G LTE (GSM Only) Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model, No Warranty XT1965-2 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Smartphone-International-Model/dp/B07NP2Y82Q,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Tiv-FndnL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NP2Y82Q,125,202.99,0.0

I received a charger that barely worked for two months, and wasn't a Motorola charger. Now the phone won't charge at all and I'm two weeks outside of the return window. So angry. First review: I previously had iPhones for several years, but wanted to make a change. I have Verizon and my contract has just run out. Rather than ""lease"" a phone from them and be stuck with that payment for another two years, I opted to give androids a try again. Overall, I am very pleased with how this refurbished phone performs. Considering it was released almost three years ago, it is fast and has no bugs (so far). It was in excellent condition. My only complaint regarding the refurbishment process is that it still had a scratched up screen protector on it. While I appreciate that the screen isn't scratched (which I first thought), I think that it should have been removed. As far as the phone goes, I am impressed with the processor, with the amount of available storage, and with the UI. It has definitely taken me a few days to get used to an android phone again, but I really don't miss my iPhone. My only real complaint with this phone is the camera. I had really hoped that some of the reviews weren't true, but it really doesn't perform as expected, considering the megapixels. As a mother of three small children, the camera is very important to me. Most of the time it takes good pictures, but outside in broad daylight, its like a blurry whiteout. I can barely make out faces. It is going to prove difficult to take pictures on our upcoming beach vacation. However, I have noticed that when I take a picture that comes out well, if I zoom in and crop it, it doesn't loose any clarity and looks spectacular.

4620,B00MWI4KKE,Jelane,2,15-Jan-16,False,"Okay Phone, TERRIBLE Customer Service from Motorolla","I had this phone for 6 months when the keyboard all of a sudden wouldn't stay open. Never had a problem before. I contacted a rep via chat. Everything she told me to try was useless, so while she was typing I found a tutorial in some forum online that solved the problem. (I can't remember what I did. Something about clearing a cache.) Anyway, I thought my problem was solved until error messages started popping up. Something about processes and various apps that had stopped working. No service was available at that point because it was New Year's Day, so I tried to find a solution online. I tried all sorts of things--clearing caches, deleting apps, etc. Finally, I reset my phone to factory condition. Then when I turned it on it would get stuck on the Motorola screen and the battery would drain rapidly. On Jan 2, I chatted with a rep again and explained the situation. A couple hours later, I delivered the phone to FedEx to be shipped to Texas for repair. Jan 7 - Received email stating my phone arrived in their warehouse. Fast forward to Jan 14, still no phone. So I call... Rep #1 (heavy accent & hard to understand) - Tells me it's going to be at least another week because they don't have my phone in stock. I ask for clarification because my phone was supposed to be repaired, not replaced. What does he mean it's not in stock? He gives a blah blah blah response, so I ask to talk to someone else. Rep #2 (even heavier accent & harder to understand) - Asks if I can be put on hold. I laugh and mention that it's funny how I just got put on hold by first rep and now I immediately have to be put on hold again. So she tells me she won't put me on hold. Instead she'll lay her headset down so I can hear everything. What the? She comes back and tells me I have to wait another week for my phone but doesn't know why. I question why the first rep said they're waiting on a new phone. She's confused and starts giving me a blah blah blah answer, so I ask to talk to someone else. Rep #3 - I explain to Kristine that I'm confused. What the heck is going on with my phone? Where is it? Why was I told they're waiting for a new phone to come in? She puts me on hold. She comes back and tells me they are actually waiting on a part for my phone. So I question why they Motorola system isn't set up so that anyone who has contact with a device is required to note it in the system. I mean, this company is in the business of connecting people in the blink of an eye. Don't tell me they can't set up a system where ALL employees who work on an account have the ability to share info related to the product. Kristine tells me that's just not how it works. I proceed to spend at least 30 minutes on the phone with her questioning the ridiculousness of the situation. I find out that the first two reps are in the Philippines, Kristine is in Wisconsin, and my phone is in Texas. Annoying. Moving on...Kristine assures me that she will make contact with the warehouse to find out the exact status of my phone. When they expect the part, how long to fix, when I can expect my phone, etc. I get off the phone with her and receive the following email approximately five hours later: Hello XXXXX, Per our earlier phone conversation I am sending you an email as well. I reached out to our warehouse to inquire about an update on the repair of your 2nd Generation Moto X for Republic Wireless. I truly apologize about the delay and the incorrect information you have received. I am working to get your repair taken care of as quickly as possible. I appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. I received a response from my warehouse informing me why your repair has been delayed. We do not currently have the necessary parts needed to repair your device. We are waiting for a shipment of the necessary parts to complete the repair. I have inquired if it would be a possibility to replace your device with a certified like new device of the same model rather than to repair it. I am awaiting their response. If we have the ability to replace the phone quicker than it could be repaired would you be interested in pursuing that route instead? I have informed our warehouse that your case is urgent and needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. I understand this process has been extremely frustrating and I apologize that you have not been kept up to date with the status of your repair. I will provide you with any updates that I receive as soon as they are available. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me directly by responding to this email or by calling me at 866-861-8157. Please reference case number XXXXX-003395 when you call. I do want to let you know that I will be out of the office until Monday 1/18/2016. If you have any questions please feel free to email me and I will respond as soon as I return to the office. I hope you have a nice evening. Kind Regards, Kristin Motorola Customer Care Executive Customer Relations Department I didn't view this email until Jan 15. As I was debating whether to wait for my phone or have them send me a certified like-new device, I get an email from FedEx at 8:27 a.m. notifying me that my device is on its way. Huh? What device? My device or a certified like-new device? I hadn't responded to Kristine's email yet, so how could a device already be on the way, not even 15 hours after she sent her email? So I call service for clarification. Rep #4 - Tells me the part for my phone was received, my phone was fixed, and now it's on its way. All in less than 24 hours of me being told it would be another week. This makes no sense to me so I start asking questions. I ask her why she said a part came in and my phone was fixed and explain why that makes no sense to me. This rep back tracks and tells me she never said it was MY phone that was fixed. She tells me it was a different phone. Oh, so apparently they have a lot of broken phones laying around waiting for parts so that they can be fixed? I was getting nowhere with her, so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. She tells me she IS a supervisor. I ask to talk to her supervisor. Rep #5 - I ask what her title is. She tells me she's a supervisor. *sigh* Moving on. I explain EVERYTHING, all the way back to the reps in the Philippines. This ""supervisor"" goes through her whole blah blah blah routine - I'm so sorry for all the confusion . . . people will need some coaching . . . I'm sorry but I can't communicate directly with the warehouse . . . I don't know why you were told that . . . I'm sorry, that person shouldn't have said that . . . No, I can't tell you what was wrong with your phone. (BECAUSE NO ONE WHO WORKS FOR THIS COMPANY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER!!! Why can't they all just get Motorola phones?) Anyway, I finally get Rep #5 to admit that she'd be pissed if she'd gotten the runaround like me. She also describes everything she can see on her computer screen about my phone, which isn't much. She deduces that when the warehouse got word from Kristine that my service needed to be expedited that they canceled the repair order and went ahead and sent me a certified USED phone. I asked rep #5 if there was any way she could find out what was wrong with my phone, maybe what part it needed. I'm just curious. I want to know what was wrong with it in case I have the same issue with the used one they're sending me. She said she can't do that because it's against their policy. Whatever. And now, I just received this email, prompting me to report what happened: Dear XXXXX, We've shipped your repaired device back to you. We had to make extensive changes, but it's now in good working condition. If you need any help or have questions, give us a call. We're standing by at 800-734-5870 Monday - Friday from 7AM-10PM, Saturday - Sunday 9AM-6PM CT.

Instead, use the contact information provided. WHAT THE {implied profanity}? ""We've shipped your repaired device back to you. We had to make extensive changes, but it's now in good working condition."" Seriously? So now they're saying they DID repair MY device? I was extremely satisfied with this phone at first (and happy that I didn't spent a fraction of the cost of an iPhone) and I had been telling people that it's just a good as an iPhone. I guess I lied. I won't be recommending Motorola devices to people anymore. Motorola either needs to make a better product that doesn't crap out after 7 months of use, or they need to create a better, more efficient customer service system. This whole cluster is just RIDICULOUS! Bottom line: If you're considering a Motorola phone, maybe consider what will happen if something goes wonky with it. The service is TERRIBLE.

There are just a few things that keep it from being a 5 star phone. 1. The camera is merely good enough. The pictures come out fine, but not great. 2. Doesn't support adoptable storage. Some phones allow you to turn the SD card into internal memory so that you can put apps on the card in order to save space. This phone gives you that option, but 9 out of 10 apps will not transfer to the card. The excuse is that the developers don't allow this, however, with some other phones you can get around this by using ADB tools on your computer to override this restriction. I wasn't able to do this with this phone. Just a minor complaint. 3. Some features that the phone supports may not be available. The phone is capable of wifi calling. I don't have this feature on my phone. The only reason that I could find is that it is not an AT&T branded phone (I'm assuming this may also be an issue with other carriers as well). It is an unlocked, international version, but greedy carriers will not allow all features to be available on phones that you don't buy directly from their store or website. It's not a Motorola issue, it is a carrier issue, but just be aware that everything the phone supports may not actually be available (99% of the things do work, but I am a little bummed about the wifi calling). Wifi calling is a big deal to me, because coverage in my neighborhood is poor. I just ended up using Google Voice which is a free wifi calling app to resolve this.

8463,B01DZJFWWS,HM,1,15-Feb-17,True,Good phone for the price - but has become unreliable,"When my galaxy 4 bit the dust I decided to go cheap. I like the Moto a lot. In fact, I like it better than my galaxy. The display is nicer and I really like that the phone wakes up when I lift it. The flashlight and quick camera open are nice features as well. There are a few things I don't like. When I tile the screens there is a lag when the x shows up in the corner to close it out. The phone is not very clear on speaker and I don't get a good connection with the cord when hook ING up to car speakers. Those are small things I would not be willing to pay an additional $500 for. And if I crack my screen, I'll be upset, but not devastated. Updated Review 12/8/2017 I have not had this phone for a year and I am experiencing problems. The number 9 key seems to get stuck, so when I try to unlock my phone, not even touching the 9 key, the 9 keeps going as if I am pressing on it. I press the power button to turn off the screen, then turn on and try several times until it finally stops. Since then I changed my lock to a pattern code, which seems to be working. There are more issues when I try to tile the open applications, the phone freezes and all the little screens began to flip out, blinking all over the place. Often times I turn the phone off and wait a few minutes before powering on again, which seems to keep it working for a little while. I am very disappointed as it seems like a $800 phone that lasts 4 years costs the same as replacing the $200 Motorola every year. Unfortunately I purchased 2 Motorola 5s from the actual Motorola site for family members before all the problems really started getting bad. I can only hope these issues have been fixed. Updated review 2/2/2018 I have learned that the proper terminology for my phone's issues is ghost touches. I contacted Motorola support and was instructed to do a factory reset, which seemed to work for a while, but now the ghost touches have gotten so bad that the phone is barely usable. My phone is still under warranty so I can send it in for repair. However, if I want a replacement phone first I have to pay a $200 deposit as well as a $24.99 fee, which I think is insane. It's a bad product, I should not have to pay for anything. I've decided to look at LG and Sony phones and make a purchase, then I will send in my Motorola. If they can fix it, great, but I am suspicious they'll blame me for the issues and I'll be out a phone anyway. Updated 2/5/2018 I got to thinking that maybe the phone I purchased is a fake phone.

4805,B00NO2WXM4,RM,5,15-Dec-14,True,Only a week of use and I already love it,"I upgraded to the 2014 Moto X from a two year old Samsung Galaxy S3. I went with the Moto X because I had been running Cayanogenmod on my GS3 and wanted something as close to vanilla Android as possible without the cost of an unlocked phone or the (semi) hassle of rooting my new phone and installing a new ROM. The Moto X is exactly what I was looking for. On the software side, the phone is still running KitKat (hopefuly Lollipop is coming from AT&T in the coming months) but there is no skin on the software like you find on LGs, Samsungs, HTCs, etc. Other than bloat, the software seems to run the same version of KitKat you would see on a Nexus device. AT&T did include some bloat, about 9 apps, but while you can't install them to free up space, you can disable them so they don't show up in your app drawer. I had heard good things about the Moto apps to improve the user experience. The moto app gives you the option to set up Assist, Actions, Voice, and Display. Research the details because they are all pretty useful. The voice portion gives you an option to give the phone a unique catchphrase to wake it up (as oposed to the ""Ok Google"" you generically use on Android) and ask it to read your texts, tell you what is coming up on your calendar, etc. The drawback for me came when using Moto voice to do anything that required a web search, such as checking the weather or asking for information. There is a four to five second delay between when you state your search and when the app goes to Google to get the results. It sounds small but compared to the default Google voice search the delay is a bit cumbersome. I ended up disabling Moto voice and just using ""Ok Google"" to search the web. The only other con I have regarding software is that there is no easy way to toggle from silent to vibrate to sound other than decreasing the volume with the rocker button. This may be an Android issue but Cayanogenmod had a button to toggle on the drop down menu. As for hardware, the build quality is top notch. The metal band around the phone and the wood back feel very premium. I only wish I hadn't dropped my old phone so many times as to convince me that I need a case on this one as not many available cases show off the back without adding a lot of bulk. The camera is pretty good, better than the GS3, but apparently not as good as some other companies' flagship phones. I don't take too many photos, so it's not a big deal for me, but research the camera so you know what you're getting in to. The screen is great, both in size and image quality. Also, the front facing speaker is better than any phone's external speaker I've heard. It's not going to give you awesome sound, but it's much better than other phones, and having it on the front makes a huge difference. A quick tip if you're upgrading in a unique situation as I was. I have an old phone plan with AT&T that serves my family better than their current lineup. Upgrading through Amazon showed that I would have to make a few changes to my rate plan and did not reflect my employer's discount. However, per AT&T's instructions, when I received the phone, rather than following the activation instructions from Amazon, I simply called AT&T and told them I wanted to activate the new phone but keep my plan exactly as it had been before. It took a three minute phone call and I was done. I've gotten my first bill and there were no surprises (still had to pay the $40 upgrade fee but that was to be expected). I was extremely happy that this worked out as I saved over $100 buying through Amazon vs AT&T.

4483,B00MWI4HW0,Denzel Garcia,5,15-Aug-15,True,Best Budget Phone of its time!,"Check out my Youtube channel AppsOnFire for a video review! So my phone has recently broke and I didn't have that much too spend so I was looking for a phone that can still perform well and not break the budget and I decided to pick up the Moto G because I have heard really great things about it. It is a great mid range phone at the price of a low end one. It has some pretty good specs and you are also getting Android Lollipop all for the price of $180 Unlocked. So here is my full review of the Moto G 2nd Generation Design So the design of the phone is actually not that bad. It certainly doesn't look like your paying only 180 dollars, it actually has pretty nice build quality and feels really nice in that hand. It may be hard to notice but the phone has a very subtle curve do it which makes it more comfortable to hold. Its not the thinnest phone out there but looks fairly slim and sleek. It also is not that heavy, it is pretty much entirely made of plastic and the back is removable which gives you access to the sim card slot and micro sd slot for expandable storage which is a big plus. You get a 5 inch 720p display and you also get some front facing speakers which is not too bad. You got all your buttons on the side which I found to be pretty mushy when first pressing them but got them used to them not too long after. Overall the design of the Moto G is nothing to write home about but is amazing for the price and I am pretty satisfied with how the phone looks and feels. Camera So usually on smartphones this cheap you get a camera that is pretty bad but that is definitely not the case with the Moto G. You actually get a pretty decent camera. But don't expect this to be a flagship camera. The phone focuses a little bit slow and it doesnt take photos very fast either. The Camera on the moto g also suffers in lowlight situations but if you have the right lighting this camera is actually pretty good. The is the same for the front camera as well. It actually takes some pretty good selfies in good conditions. Here are some samples. Performance So how does this phone perform at such a low price. Many people think at this price point that a phone can't perform well but that is not the case here with the Moto G. It is still packing a 1.2 ghz Quad core processor with a gig of Ram which is still some decent specs in todays standards. Everything usually runs smoothly with the Moto G because it is running pretty much stock android with no bloatware or skin to slow it down. But multitasking seems to slow this phone down and will start to lag if you have a bunch of apps open. But the lag is not so bad that the phone becomes unusable. Overall this phone can handle your daily tasks as long as you dont go crazy and the battery life will last almost a full day of you are not a crazy power user. Final thoughts So that is pretty much the end of my review and the Moto G is a great budget phone for people who need a backup or who are just trying to save some money but still want a great phone.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-2nd-generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00MWI4HW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OLIW5q0eL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00MWI4HW0,3,99.0,0.0

5033,B00O2SW2IY,GaryTucson,4,15-Apr-15,False,GREAT LITTLE PHONE THAT WAS WELL WORTH THE $49.99 I PAID FOR IT!!!!,"I took a real chance three months ago, and I'm very glad I did. I had been with Sprint post-paid for 15 years, always hoping they would make good on their promises to improve their coverage, speeds, etc. and remaining loyal. Finally, with minimal signal in my home, little luck with their Air Rave hot spot and tired of their empty promises to build new towers and implement 4G in my area, I bought this great little phone at Best Buy for $49.99, signed up for Verizon's new $45/mo. prepaid plan with auto-pay in order to get the extra 500MB data every month, and have never looked back. In fact, I now wonder why I waited so long. But, this review isn't about me, or Sprint, or Verizon, it's about this cool little phone, and I guess the first thing I would need to say is that it is NOT worth what it's now selling for, but it was WELL worth what I paid for it. It runs on a slightly modified version Kit Kat for Motorola and Verizon (and by that, I mean Motorola and Verizon unfortunately found some way to block Kit Kat's ability to store or move apps to the SD card on this phone, even though stock Kit Kat allows that - however, this is one of the only real drawbacks I have found using this phone now for three months) With that said, everything else about this admittedly entry-level phone is exactly what I was looking for as a break away from Sprint contract. It has a fast dual-core 1.5 GHz processor, 8GB internal memory and 1GB RAM. The main camera is 8MP (the selfie lens is VGA), but it takes surprisingly good 1080p video. These are, admittedly, low-end specs for a newer phone, and that's why it's NOT worth what it now costs. But as a smartphone, it works as well as any of my friend's MUCH more expensive phones, and Verizon's incredible network makes it a joy compared to what I put up with from Sprint for so many years. Not only does the phone work for calls quite literally everywhere I go, it also finds a 4G signal where other networks in the area can't even pretend to (almost everywhere I have gone - even up into the mountains), and it locates me and displays a map with navigation faster than any of my friend's phones do, has great sound through headphones, plays great videos, and does everything else you could possibly want from a low to mid-level device. Just for fun, I have compared it with a Samsung Galaxy S4 on the AT&T network for the last month, and it's faster, gets better cell and data signals everywhere I have tested them. And I LOVE the proprietary Motorola Circles widget that comes with this phone. That app is one of the coolest apps ever made, and there is nothing that compares to it available anywhere. Bottom line? While this device wouldn't satisfy the most demanding techies out there, it more than satisfies this less demanding one. I'm very pleased I no longer settle for any of the other networks that can't compare with Verizon and I'm very happy with the phone I bought to make that move.",11.0,Motorola,Verizon 4G LTE Moto Luge by Motorola Prepaid Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Moto-Motorola-Prepaid-Smartphone/dp/B00O2SW2IY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612FFO+p-3L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00O2SW2IY,31,74.98,0.0

It does not have band 12 no matter what they say. I could make phone calls at 2G but, every time somebody would call me it would kick right to voicemail. In fact, I gave the IMEI number of the device to my carrier and they did a fool signal check on it and determined that it did not have hardly any of the bands that was needed including band 12. Trying to use this on a GSM carrier in the United States is very undependable. The phone is gorgeous and has great specifications and the 720p looks like a 1080p screen.

The battery is fantastic and typically lasted me all day. My reason for 3 stars may make some scratch their head, but it is a deal killer for me. If I paid full price, I'd be livid and the Moto X4 would be back in the hands of Amazon. Why? Well this phone lacks a notification light (well not really, it’s there but MOTOROLA WON""T ACTIVATE IT).

I bought one when my iPhone conked out, because we had bought one for our 14-yr-old son for Christmas and it's working well for him. I didn't want to pay the Apple premium so I bought another Moto for myself. The price is right, and everything works, but the placement of the buttons that control sound are right next to the home button, and I'm constantly fussing with the ringer and media volume. Often, I accidentally turn off the ringer, and then I miss calls and texts even though the phone is sitting right next to me. I work from a home office and my phone is my professional lifeline. I can't keep missing calls. Also, no matter how I set up the notification settings for things like texts and WhatsApp, I either don't get notices or I get every notice very loudly. There doesn't seem to be an in between. I really miss the Apple features like the sound-off switch and home button, and even though I've used this Moto for a few months now, I just can't seem to make it work for my needs. Maybe it's user error, but I'm pretty smart and I think it just has design flaws that interfere with how I need to use a phone. I finally ordered a new iPhone and will gladly relegate this to the 'back up' pile in case we lose or break a phone. At least I'm not out much money, as I was able to use my discover rewards to get this phone very inexpensively.

3345,B00HPP3QD6,hbaum,4,14-May-14,True,"Excellent phone, but not an 8 GB","My last 2 phones before this were an iPhone 4, and a Galaxy S3. My first major annoyance with this phone was the lack of a physical home button, unlike the iPhone and GS3. After 2 weeks now with the Moto G I've gotten used to that, but it is still a bit annoying that the digital buttons are part of the actual screen. Again, that's not a deal breaker, just kind of weird that it was designed that way, rather than using the extra space below the screen for the buttons. Overall, for 100 bucks, this is a spectacular phone. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is not an 8GB phone, as advertised. The phone comes with a total capacity of 5.52 GB, and about 4.5 available GB after the Kit Kat update. Again, for 100 bucks, I am shocked at how great of a phone this is. Its not AS good as an iPhone or a Galaxy phone, but it is actually conparable, for a fraction of the price.

5327,B00OZTSY6Y,Madden,4,14-Jun-15,True,VERY happy with the battery life,"I will say from the beginning I am not a super techie phone person. This phone has a lot of great things it can do to make it useful, but what I was really looking for was something with enough battery life to get me through the day. I work outdoors and often have little to no cell service which can be a huge draw on the battery. My old phone often drained so fast I had to shut it off for the day to conserve enough battery in case of an emergency. I was a little reluctant to try this phone, as many reviewers stated they were not getting the full 48 hours of battery life advertised. I am happy to say I am not only getting 48 hours, but generally 72+ hours between charging (I just put the phone on the charger this morning - it was down to 7% after running for 3 1/2 days since it's last charge). I should clarify that I do NOT have my wi-fi on all the time (not much need in the woods), and I use the phone mostly as a phone for talking, texting, some email, and some internet browsing. I really like the fact that as the battery gets below 10% it doesn't take a nose dive down to 0 like my old phone, so is still usable for several hours even below 10%. There are many other reviews here listing the pros and cons of all the aspects of this phone, so I won't go there. I really wanted to share if you are looking for a nice phone with good battery life and use it more like a phone and not a computer, you should be pleased with the battery life of the Turbo. I have also read some negative reviews regarding the cell reception of this phone. It seems to work as well if not better than my HTC DNA out in the woods. In general I would say I have slightly better reception in areas of low reception than I did with my old phone. My only criticism (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars) is it's a little big. Only slightly bigger than the DNA, but that difference is enough that I have a hard time doing anything one handed. I have pretty small hands, and the DNA seemed to be a perfect size for me. The slightly thicker and wider Turbo seems huge in my hand, but I guess I will get used to that. Overall, I really like the phone. Getting over 3 days of use between charges is great.

1385,B0096QYH80,Molly,2,14-Jul-13,False,I miss my old phone,"I was due for an upgrade, so I went with this phone because it was a ""free"" phone and because the screen is about the same size as the X. I had a Droid X for 2/3 years or something like that. This phone feels like a downgrade in many aspects. The camera is absolute garbage, especially compared to my old phone. There isn't even a macro setting (for small things, like, for example, if you wanted to take a picture of a bug). Maybe it's not a fair comparison, because I'm pretty sure the X had a better camera than a point'n'shoot camera I have. I cannot stand the location of the screen on button. It's right above the volume rocker, and when watching videos or something, I'll go to turn the volume up and turn the screen off and then have to find my place in the video again. The other thing about buttons that really irritates me is that there is NO WAY to connect the notification and ringer volume. You can't just turn the rocker up or down to change both. It only changes the ringer. This irritates the hell out of me. I've tried downloading like every volume app out there to try to fix it in the background, but you can only use them when they're open... so it's at least somewhat of a fix... but it's something that I shouldn't have had to fix. I also miss all of the real-people buttons on the screen. I really like having real buttons for things. Like, I would have preferred to have a real keyboard on a phone, rather than the touch screen one, but not even my old phone had that. The reason being is that my fingers get very cold very frequently and sometimes have a hard time being picked up on any touch screen. I dislike that these buttons will also go away in certain apps, or the lights will dim so you can't see what the button does. It is nice; however, to have the buttons rotate around when you turn the phone. I've had some minor problems trying to open up apps and the phone thinks I've slid my finger to move the screen. This may be because of touch screens not liking me, but my X never did that of which I can think. I've also been having a difficult time with anything with music or sound. For some weird reason, my music skips when I play it in the car. My X never did that once. I also use lightning bug at night for white noise and I've noticed that skipping often. I can't understand why it would skip... it isn't a cd or a tape and in the car, I can't use a tape adapter (anymore) and it has to play through the radio. This is also not a fault of the radio thing, because, again, it has never happened with my X. The nice thing is being able to disable bloatware apps. It still may be on the phone, but you can disable it and it won't bother you anymore. That is a really nice feature that I wish my X had. Getting the SD card out is a pain, but it is a lot easier to do than with the Droid X. No more taking out the battery to remove it. Overall, I really miss my Droid X and I'm honestly thinking about switching back to it.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

But what it lacks in specs it makes up for in value. I bought mine at walmart for $70 and received a $20 shop card upon purchase. For $50 you will not find a better phone. First thing that got me was the fact that it is quiet a bit smaller than my last few phones. I got used to having a 5 inch + screen so the 4.5 feels kind of small, but I am starting to enjoy that about it. Makes it easier to hold and use on a normal basis. As far as the performance goes I have nothing to complain about so far. I don't do much mobile gaming or anything like that, but this phone will tackle all of my daily calling, texting, and mobile browsing (including some video watching) with ease. I would imagine it would run most games just fine. The only complaint I really have about this phone is the fact that it DOES NOT have expandable storage. This is a pretty big deal for me because I have a pretty large music library that I can not put on this phone. But for the price I am not going to complain about this. This phone is fantastic.

But that is all that is good. Time for a horror story, children. Three days after receiving this phone, I dropped it for the first time ever. Gorilla glass my middle finger. It shattered from less than two feet, although it was on concrete. (Didn't have chance to get case yet). I bought a case with built in screen protector to keep glass in, moved on. Yesterday, I felt my phone becoming hot to the point it was hard to touch in my backpack. With a heavy duty case on. That's a big problem. I had no idea why this was happening, as I didn't drop it hard or step on or abuse it at all after my first incident. (Learned my lesson well.) I took it out of my bag to find that nothing was on the screen aside from a cluster of green pixels scattered across the right side of the screen. It would show up at random, not when I pressed the power button or anything, just when it felt like it. It had been acting weird earlier. It had no 4g signal for some reason, no service whatsoever other than wifi. I checked to make sure I had 4g on and it was on. Turned wifi off just to see. No reception for 3 hours. Everybody else, including people using same carrier, had good connection. I had to restart phone to get signal back. Anyway, after cooling down, the screen wouldn't show the pixels as often and now it won't show at all. It will sometimes vibrate when I hold power button for long time, but not always. No sound or anything. Can't recover all that info I had on it, because it had a passcode and I can't unlock, even when pressing where the numbers should be.

26498,B07WSXH2W2,Jonnymo,5,14-Dec-19,True,Great phone for the price,"My $8million LG6 that was pretty worthless over its lifetime broke when the phone was out of contract and I pulled the sim card out to replace it with a new one. The cheap plastic tray broke inside and without mortgaging the house, there was no way it could be fixed. So, rather than go all in and drop another grand on a stupid phone, I bought this one. I have to say, for the price, it's a darn good phone. It took a while to set up, all the software updates and whatnot, but it took to my sim card from AT&T like a fish to water. It's got a nice clean look, Motorola has some nifty features built in, and for a guy like me who really doesn't do much but listen to music, check email, and surf the net, this works like a charm. I powered up the phone on a Thursday afternoon. It's now Saturday afternoon and I have 42% battery left. Granted, I haven't used it a ton, but still, no complaints there given my LG6 would power down in about 14 nanoseconds after hitting 100%. Keep in mind, there isn't a ton of memory here, but I put in an SD card and store all my photos, music and movie downloads there. That too is easy to do and keeps your internal drive in good working order. As for the camera, full disclosure, I'm no Ansel Adams or Annie Liebovitz, but I find it more than adequate. I will have to give the nod to the LG6 in terms of better quality, but if you start to break down the price per photo, LG has it around $87.42 a pic, and the Motorola is about $.0000001. So that's a pretty good savings. Seriously, I'm never buying another phone for more than $100 again.

24813,B07RB78W37,Paisley,5,14-Dec-19,False,"Oh Motorola, you've done it again.","I hemmed and hawed for a while about which phone I should buy. My Moto G5 Plus had served me well for two and a half years, but it was starting to show its age. I like Motorolas—you get a lot for your money, and you get the benefit of the funky Moto gestures along with it. I had my eye on the Z4 not only because of its Moto-ness, but because of the mods. Mods! Your phone becomes a battery powerhouse, a tiny boombox, or a Polaroid camera just by snapping on an attachment! Then I looked at the professional review sites. Reviewers using high-end iPhones and Galaxies as their yardsticks railed against the Z4’s Snapdragon 675 processor and its 4 GB of RAM, warning potential buyers that their lives would be mired in sluggish load times and laggy keyboard action if they chose the Moto over, say, a flagship OnePlus. So I briefly looked elsewhere. There is no dearth of phone options out there nowadays: phones with half a dozen cameras littering the back; phones with more RAM than some gaming PCs; phones with screens so big and clear you can read them from space. But in the end, I was always drawn back to the Z4. Boy, am I glad I was. Full disclosure: I am not an ultra-heavy phone user. I use it mostly for email, messaging, calls, web browsing, and some reasonably low-demand games (like Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing). But for what I need it for, it performs flawlessly. Some of the things I like: -The OLED screen is very, very clear. Some folks are bothered by the camera notch at the top of the screen, but I haven’t found it to be a distraction. It's also kind of big, which I and my tiny hands were worried about, but that turned out not to be a problem either. -MODS. Mods are GREAT. Don’t let anyone tell you mods aren’t cool. -It has a headphone jack! -It’s already got 128 GB of storage built right in, but you can expand that out to half a terabyte. If your phone is also where you carry your music with you, you’ve got it made. -The Moto gesture controls are seriously handy. Chop twice for flashlight—twist twice for camera—three-finger screenshot—and one button navigation. One of my favorite actions that I haven’t seen many people mention is “swipe to shrink,” which means that you can make the screen a fraction of the size in either direction for easier one-handed use. My aforementioned tiny hands appreciate it. -Lag? What lag? This thing’s fast enough to give Chuck Yeager a run for his money. -I haven’t had the same problems with the in-screen fingerprint sensor that others have had. Just like the Motorola reps say in responses to reviews, it does actually get better with time. Setting it up was a little janky, but once it’s done, just keep working with it and it’ll work with you. (I also like to map a couple different fingerprints, too, just in case one works better than another.) -This isn’t widely advertised, but the Z4 is compatible with MPP (Microsoft Pen Protocol) styluses: the ones that work with Surface tablets. That puts it on a similar level as phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note, for a fraction of the price. -I really don’t mind that the mods don’t fit flush along the curved edges of the phone. However, I do use a bumper case around the edge when I’ve got mods on, so I don’t even see the gaps. -It’s still got an FM radio! That pleases me to a ridiculous level. The one thing I can think of that I’m not crazy about is the built-in speaker. Compared to the speaker on my G5 Plus, it’s awfully wimpy. I’d recommend getting one of the speaker mods, whether the JBL mod or Motorola’s own. Overall, I would recommend the Z4. Maybe you’ve had a Moto Z in the past, and you’ve got some mods you’d like to use again. Maybe you just need a good phone for a decent price that’s got a couple perks attached. Whatever reason you have for buying it, it’s an absolutely solid choice.

18811,B07CHWMYHP,Tianji Z.,1,14-Aug-19,True,Very disappointed to the phone's performance,"As a former Motorola engineer, I thought that I should give some support to its products because Motorola was a great company with great products. So after my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge was soaked by the water in the sea, I decided to look for a Motorola phone. I do not need a fancy one, but one with good camera and smooth internet browsing is mostly what I need. So I bought this Moto G6 Plus international version. Two months after the purchase, I was very disappointed to the performance and quality. I should give the review earlier but I had a lot of travels and finally today I decided to write the review. If I could I would give the rating ZERO star. Come on, guys, did you really test the product before you shipped it to the market? Here are some reasons why this phone is bad: 1. Camera is really crappy. ~30% of the time it cannot focus and the photos are blurry. Sometimes it focuses but is easy to lose focus. This makes taking photos really difficult and unclear. Far objects are not clear , as well as close-up. 2. Touchscreen: The touchscreen does not function well!!! It is lag in response. And obviously it is not calibrated or aligned well -- sometimes I use finger to touch one browsing link, the other link far above or below is open. This makes me frustrated because I have to go back doing again. Similarly I touch one app icon but it takes me to another app! 3. Internet browsing is slow and sluggish. My 7 edge was launched ~5 year ago, but it surfs internet smoothly. I assumed that the G6 plus should have faster core and should be at least as fast as a product of ~5 years ago. 4. RF signal is not good. When we travel overseas, in the most cases my phone shows EDGE in data roaming. My wife's iphone still has LTE. We have T-MOBILE family plan and both phones are with T-mobile roaming plan. Do not know if it is antenna design issue or RF system performance issue for this G6 Plus. That is all for this review. I want to support Motorola products but with the performance like this G6 Plus I might get something like iPhone or Samsung phone instead.",3.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 Plus - 64GB - 5.9"" FHD+, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1926-7 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Plus-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHWMYHP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511i4Qx+e2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHWMYHP,185,174.94,184.99

3993,B00K0NS0P4,Natty AKA Picky Polly,4,13-Nov-14,True,Cheap & Cheerful.,"I've had the phone for 48 hours now. I'll update my review if time changes any of my opinions about this phone. At this point, I feel like this would be the perfect phone... except for the camera. The camera is pretty darn bad. Before this phone, I had the Nexus 5, which really was perfection but I'm hard on my electronics and the Nexus was the top of what I was willing to spend on a phone. After accidentally dropping that phone in a body of water, I seriously considered getting another one used but I'm glad I took a chance on the Moto G instead. I use my phone to make actual phone calls (I know, who does that?) and I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on the call quality. Everything sounds great on my end. I have yet to test it with an earpiece or headphone-with-microphone set up; I'll update when (if) I do. The phone hooks up easily and reliably with the Bluetooth in my car. It also hooks up easily with the Bluetooth in my speaker bar in my living room, which is something that wasn't reliable with my old Nexus. I'm really enjoying throwing Amazon Prime Music to my speakers when I'm hanging out at home. The Bluetooth also easily grabs info from my FitBit throughout the day. I do a lot of texting/Hangouts/Facebook messaging and everything is speedy, though Hangouts and texts aren't coming together as automatically as I would like. I also use a lot of fitness apps like MyFitnessPal, Pact, and FitBit and everything runs like butter. I love how little bloatware was loaded on the phone and I'm actually enjoying using the Assist and Alert apps that came with the phone. I haven't tried anything requiring GPS but will update when I do. The battery life is impressive! It arrive half charged and I did all my phone set up and first day abuse without charging (even updated the operating system!) and I was still left with a quarter charge by bedtime. I charged it fully overnight and I've been playing with it heavily since then, downloading apps, casting Netflix to our Chromecast, streaming music to our speakers, wifi and Bluetooth on at all times, made two hours worth of phone calls, took a ton of (bad) pictures, let curious family members fiddle with it, and 24 hours later, I still have 15% of the battery left. The one thing that stinks about the phone is the camera. I know the best camera is the one you have with you, but I think that's only true if the camera has the ability to take a focused picture. I've downloaded and played with six different camera apps so far and some have helped (A Better Camera is the best one I've found so far) but it's a lot of work to take a picture of a still life, forget capturing the antics of a puppy or a toddler. I don't mind too much as I have a very nice point-and-shoot that lives in my purse but it would be difficult to use it for the more practical pictures I want my smartphone to take (ie, the ingredients in a recipes from a cookbook, paint samples at the home improvement store, the license plate of a car, a price sticker.) Maybe the next system update will help with this. I would rank the picture quality as slightly better than the camera I had on my Razr in 2006 but below my Galaxy 2. I took a few pictures for this review and included the best one I was able to massage out of the camera. It was taken it bright diffused light with the camera balanced on a flat surface and I still had to take several shots to get an in-focus picture. I've found it to be useless with a moving subject and/or dimmer lighting. I'm thrilled with everything but the camera at this point and would heartily recommend it to anyone wanting a budget smartphone, so long as they heed my warnings about the camera!",7.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (1st Generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00K0NS0P4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L5LzVmrcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00K0NS0P4,1,209.75,0.0

I loved the driving mode that the 2nd Gen had...while the X4 doesn't work quite as well as the 2nd Gen did, I still like the fact that ""OK Google"" will unlock the screen and listen for my commands.

22794,B07NPRQYP1,Adrian,5,13-May-19,True,Great phone for battery life and price point,"My Moto Z Play battery was in the process of dying (battery swelling, lifting the lcd screen 1mm off the frame, 1 charge barely lasting 3 hours) so I googled phones with long battery life and was pleasantly surprised to find the Moto G7 Power. I was tossing up between a new Moto Z Play again and this, but decided on this as it had no recorded battery issues that Z Play does. There is a Z4 Play coming out, but it's still not for a few months, so I bit the bullet and sold my Moto mod projector and bought this G7 Power. I am overseas, so have none of the issues American reviewers have with being able to connect with networks. The phone comes with clear plastic case on. (pics of the phone as it is in the box front and rear are attached). I read a review here which said it gets slippery without the case, so i've left it on. Overall, it's been good. Small amount of time needed to reinstall apps. It works smoothly, it's great knowing you can not worry about battery dying late at night. Phone apps work smoothly. Screen is supposedly a lower res compared to very latest phones, but I haven't noticed any problems at all there. Photos and videos are fine too. Only issue was the included little pin, which is for sticking into the little pinhole, to eject the holder for the sim card and sd memory card. While it fit the G7 Power's one, it was slightly too large for my Z Play's hole, so I had to find a paper clip to eject from the Z Play's holder. I was at a seminar, before it started, while changing things over, so I didn't have easy access to my own office to get a paper clip. Sounds like a small issue, but it almost brought my eagerly awaited new phone's use to a halt for the day. Only other things, having used the phone for a week, is I haven't been able to get the much vaunted 3 days per charge battery life boasted about. So far, the best I've gotten is 100%--> 5% lasting 32 hours. Still, for daily use, it's good to know that for a 12 hour period, I am able to take 1100 photos, 3 videos, have data constantly on, and the battery will still be at 55% And I'm really pleased with the price. Given how quickly these things depreciate, I can't bring myself to pay top dollar for mobiles. For the price, you get a lot of phone, imho. Edit 9th Oct 2019- software works just like day 1. Battery doesn't work quite as long. Might reach 15% in 18 =========== hours continuous use now.

I love running an updated version of Android for a change. I also love the dual core processor. It is smooth. I haven't encountered any lag as of yet running any app. The 8GB of internal RAM doesn't seem to be an issue for me. I don't have a ton of stuff to put on the phone, and even if I did I have a 32GB SD card for media, so 8GB is plenty of internal storage. The battery life in this thing is phenomenal. I haven't felt a pressing need to charge the phone at all yet because it survives all day until bed time with ample power left every day. I plug my phone in every night as a matter of habit from my old phones. I don't think this phone needs it though. I leave 4G data on all day. I also have rules setup to enable WiFi when I'm home. The rules are especially nice and handy for controlling the phone without actively having to change settings, which is something I had to often on my Droid Charge. I especially appreciate the smaller form factor of this phone. My Charge had a 4.3"" screen, as does this phone, but the Charge feels like a brick now compared to the Razr M. I specifically didn't get the HD version because I don't want a ridiculously large screen. I don't need it. I don't plan on watching movies on my phone. I've taken some pictures and am quite satisified with the camera for my average uses. The shutter is unbelievably quick compared to the Charge. I was especially surprised by the quality of an image taken under full zoom. I love the aluminum frame and the kevlar back plate. The mirror on the back is a nice touch too so I can take vanity shots with a higher quality lens, though I don't really intend on doing so too often. I generally hate pictures of myself.

The problem I have is that the phone has a very hard time attaching data to texts or emails. I will often have to try to send a text or email 5 or 6 times if I'm attaching a picture. Then it may take 10 minutes to go through or I will just give up and stop trying. Also, there is this annoying ""background data restricted"" notification that comes up all day long. I've tried everything to change the settings in the phone to not restrict data even if the phone is idle. I took it in to Verizon and they couldn't fix the problem. What this means is that I can't stream Slacker or Pandora radio because once the phone has been idle for 5-10 minutes it shuts off the data stream. So it will usually play 1 or 2 songs and then cut out and I have to restart the application. Verizon thought this was part of the Smart Actions, but all smart actions are turned off.

Oh boy was I wrong, I had used a OnePlus one for almost five years prior so I always preferred stock Android and the Motorola software that comes on this phone is basically stock with a few added cool features! The big benifit from that is better battery life, and with a 5000Mah battery you're going to get good battery no matter what software you're using, but it's still cool that Motorola goes the stock route instead of bloating like most manufactures do. The ONLY thing that is sub par on this phone is the camera, and the display has decent color accuracy but falls behind 1080p screens from 2014 even. But still, for 200$ you can't go wrong with this.

HOWEVER Within three months of original purchase it would no longer charge. Although I found a handy blog where someone showed that if you press a nickel between the back of the phone and a protective case which restored the charging function (something to do with the internal heat sensor malfunctioning), that's a dumb way to live with a BRAND NEW PHONE. So I returned it under warranty to Motorola (paying $25 for their expedited phone in hand version). That was a month and a half ago, and now the replacement will no longer turn on. The phone is great, when it works, but since it dies on its own (never dropped, kept in TPS case with screen protector) I would avoid like the plague.

I'm a guy with smaller than average size hands who upgraded from a 5"" screen. I'll admit, the ergonomics have changed (using with one hand is a little more challenging, but not that bad) but for the most part it's no big deal. The battery life is great. I can easily last an entire day, sometimes even when I start with less than half a charge. I watch a lot of YouTube videos, so it does pretty well. I haven't had nearly as many issues with phone service as some others have. Only one day did it not read my SIM card. I just tried putting it in the second slot and it fixed the problem. I use a provider that operates on AT&T's network, but I almost always have 4G LTE. Sometimes it goes dead when I'm inside certain buildings, but it doesn't happen frequently enough to really be an issue. I've had it over a month.

1272,B0096QYH80,CKC,5,13-Jun-13,False,Nice Phone... But,"I'd like to start by saying this phone should get four stars. But I read a lot of possibly unfair 1 star reviews here and wanted to offset that a little. This being my first smart phone I was incredibly excited and did a lot of research. Becuase of budget I limited myself to what Verizon offered for free with a 2-year contract. And, to be honest, I think this is probably the best Android phone through Verizon for the money right now. (Of course I could be wrong) Overall, the phone is great. I love the large bright display. Reception is great in my area. I have the smallest data plan so I limit most of my online activities ot WiFi. But when I used the 4G, it seemed fast enough to do what I need to do. I think this is a great little phone. Now here is what I wish I had known before purchasing the phone. It's an 8GB phone. But what they may not tell you in the store or is listed in the very non-specific small print is that about 3.5 GB of that 8GB is already used and cannot be reclaimed. From basic after-purchase research I guess it's from the OS, reserved space for future updates and 'bloatware'. (apps that come with the phone... and in the case of Android / Verizon, cannot be uninstalled). So after purchase you really get about 4 GB of storage for apps. Just be sure to get a microSD card and point your pictures / video to it and I think the average user will be fine with the remaining space. I tend to get app happy on my Android tablet. I'm just being a little more conscious of apps and space with my new phone., I look at it like this, I can tolerate having what is actually a 4GB phone and I can tolerate the bloatware for a really nice phone that was basically free. The good news for us Android users is that we have the micro SD slot where you can store your pictures, movies and songs. And we don't have to deal with iTunes. (the main reason I did not choose an iPhone) So bottom line for me is that I'm okay with those compromises. I would recommend this phone. Just know going in that you'll have about 1/2 as much space as advertised and a lot of pre-installed apps that you may not use and cannot remove.",5.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

Phone software channel is RETLA (Latin America) if you want RETUS (United States). I did the research, so you don't have to, but I do suggest you read (google) these issues before buying this. Nowhere does it state this is a phone with a Latin America software channel that is updated in latin language but is only warranteed in the region it is purchased for. Also the U.S. version will be updated to Android Pie soon with possible no updates for this version. If your in the U.S. and want a phone that is updatable in english and warranted in the U.S, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.

I returned the phone and I was refunded promptly, so kudos to no problems there. I didn't rate this a 1-star due to the phone was new and nice, the seller did refund quickly as well.

8449,B01DZJFWNC,The_Debrainer,5,13-Jul-16,True,Moto G4 Plus 64GB - 4GB RAM,"{(((1 year update, well 11 months))) : this moto g4 plus is still going strong. no problems with it to report, still charges fast and holds a charge all day. } Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed... First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good. the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made. The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB. CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAM The buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them. the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast. I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected. The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen. IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance. the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear. Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie. The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet. Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons. The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature. This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun. Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are: No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked. No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning. Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me. ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE: I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering. I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone. EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive. The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.

14666,B072ZWCKP5,CFred,5,13-Jan-18,True,Recommend,"I love this phone. I'm a big believer in budget phones. Got this on a great Black Friday deal. Even at full price, it's decent, but at $115 for the non-Amazon version (no ads), it's by far the best phone per dollar out there. Performance and camera are just average, but definitely not an issue. Decent screen. Good, reliable LTE and WiFi. Can handle everything u need it for. The biggest standouts me: 1. Near stock Android. No UI or skin. No bloatware (with non-Amazon ads version). Just a few small Moto apps, which are actually useful. 2. Great fingerprint scanner. Quick and efficient. And is also multi use. Moto's ""one button nav"" lets you take away the constant navigation bar at the bottom taking up screen space like most androids. 5.5"" of fully used screen at all times. Doesn't sound like a major deal, but it does make a difference. 3. Most important. The battery. ABSURD! I use it all day with moderate use and have 80% at night. Can last days. All in all. Highly recommend. UPDATE: After 5 months of use, still loving it (In terms of price/value ). No issues. Very dependable. Sticking with everything said above, except for the camera. Well below average unless in ideal light conditions. If you're big on smartphone cameras, you'll be disappointed. Also, fingerprint scanner has started not recognizing sometimes.

The reception seems to be the same as my Alcatel Idol 4s Windows phone. - This may not have fingerprint unlock but yes, it has facial rec unlock which works really well as long as you have adequate lighting. - Moto actions. There are a lot and they are pretty slick. - Snappy processor. I see no lag so far. - Removable Battery - Nylon (I believe) back cover. Yes, it is not glass but who cares? If it were, there would be a case on it anyway covering it up. - I would say this unit satisfies the vast majority of users at a meager price. - Camera is decent. Better than my Alcatel or the same. It is definitely more responsive. Negatives - It is not a Windows phone. It is Android.

I haven't owned a Motorola phone since my StarTac back in the day, but I'm likely to stick with them for my phones going forward, as I've gotten G5/6 phones for my kids and now a G7 Power for my wife and this G7, all with good results. The build quality is great on this phone. I am not seeing any issues with how it comes together, it isn't flimsy and it doesn't feel mid-range or less than premium in any way to me. I've owned Sony, Samsung, Apple and OnePlus phones, and see no disadvantage to the G7 in that regard. I love the size of this phone. I have small-ish hands, and this desire to put a laptop sized screen in people's hands and call it a phone has me going nuts. It's tough to get a decent-spec'd phone in a size that doesn't look like you're holding a movie screen up to your ear these days, but the G7 is nicely sized. It isn't massively smaller than the Sony I've been carrying for 18 months or so, but in daily use I literally feel the difference in how my fingers have to stretch to swipe type with one hand or just getting across the screen to open an app. It is a lighter phone, too, which is nice. The speed of this phone is noticeably better than the A2 Ultra as well. Granted, it's a newer phone, and new SoCs on these phones from year to year are still making decent leaps, but I'm not waiting for my email client to delete messages anymore and make me think it's locked up, swiping is noticeably faster, etc. I don't use my phone as a PC (I use a PC as a PC) but faster is generally better in any computing device. I do miss the dedicated camera button. That was a nice feature the Sony had this does not, but I'm not trying to be a professional photographer with the phone, so opening the app is just fine. The camera takes great photos, and I don't see any difference in these pics and the reference pics of $1000+ devices or even $700 devices. I'm snapping pics of my kids and S/N stickers on servers or other things I need to remember and don't want to write down, so I'm not expecting the quality of a Nikon or Hasselblad camera, and I don't care frankly because I'm eating the rolled tacos, not taking the freaking sunset heart hands picture. Period. Battery life is good, but I will say the Sony beats the G7. I could go 2.5, sometimes 3 days without a charge on my Sony, and I'm getting roughly 2 on the G7. I'm not tweeting every time I blink or trying to explain to the world why the dimple in MY pancakes is photo worthy and you should all care about me and like me with your anonymous click so I feel validated in my life, so perhaps I'm not the average user here, but 2 days worth of phone calls, a smart watch connected via bluetooth, dozens to hundreds of texts and news notifications coming in is a pretty decent battery. :-) The stock Android 9 experience is good, not a lot of bloatware. I do wish manufacturers would tell Google to get a clue and give me Ringer volume control on my buttons. This is not a move screen, so controlling media volume is not the primary thing I want to do with this device. It is a phone. Ringer volume and in-call volume are the primary volume necessities for A PHONE. Give me the option (like there used to be) of dedicating the VOLUME buttons to things like, I don't know, VOLUME of the ringer? This is the one beef I've had with the stock Android experience I have had for some time now. I wish Lenovo would give me that option in their settings. The Moto gestures are a little goofy to me. I used a OnePlus / LineageOS for a long time, and their implementation of gestures on the screen was, IMO, superior. Shaking my phone, even though it doesn't cost $1000, just feels like asking for trouble. Give me lock screen gestures for things like the camera and flashlight instead, please. I've tried the face recognition as well, and I'm more security conscious than many, so I'll be sticking to my complex screen pattern, thanks. Nice idea, it seems to work pretty well, but the risks are high with that method of unlocking. I don't have government secrets on my phone, but I still like the data I keep there to be safe. I'm testing the fingerprint scanner right now, and the placement is good, it seems to work well, and I haven't been able to fool it with other fingers or placement tricks. If it's not your print, it doesn't seem to unlock. I'll be testing it further for sure. Oh, and headphone jack -- YES! So I can use the gazillion pairs of headphones I have in my office, travel kit, office bag, etc., and not have to worry if my wireless buds are charged all the time. Good thinking, Lenovo. Wish I could add 1/2 a star just for that. All in all, I'm glad I made the move, and I'm likely to stick with Moto going forward unless OnePlus comes back down to where they used to be price-wise and fixes some of their other issues. I don't see the value in Samsung and will never go back to Apple's closed ecosystem and the abomination that is iTunes. Most other vendors in the $700+ range just don't justify their price when you work with this phone.

9879,B01LEL8ABY,runkrambs,1,13-Dec-16,True,"If you want to use Bluetooth for ANYTHING, do not buy this phone","One last update. If I could give this 0 starts I would...especially after using my Galaxy S8+. My smart watch no longer disconnects randomly. I can sync my MISFIT without power cycling the phone, and I can make and receive calls in my car reliably. The Moto Z Bluetooth performance is truly awful and ruins the entire experience. Didn't they used to talk about Seemless Mobility? My final jab at this crappy product will be that as I was driving back from FedEx with my Galaxy S8+ I made one last call with my Moto Z to check on my mom and her chemo session earlier that day. No kidding, it dropped the connection three times, which was just perfect to make my mom repeat what she was saying three times. Sadly, I am editing my review and lowering to 1 star. I ended up returning the phone through Motorola as I had missed my window with Amazon. I have to say the return process was completely painless, and I had a brand new phone in less than a week. That's where the good news ends. After a month, I think the Bluetooth performance on this one might even be worse. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to not be able to make or receive a phone call in my car with any confidence that the audio will route properly. This is a basic feature I've expected from bargain basement phones for the past 10+ years. A premium flagship phone has to cover the basics. To make matters worse, I recently won a fitness tracker. It synchs with the phone via Bluetooth. Lo and behold, it has problems connecting often, and the only solution is to power cycle the phone. Even after that, the phone shows that Bluetooth is on, but the app says it's off, and asks for permission to turn it on. I allow that, and magically Bluetooth works again. To sum up, if you plan on using Bluetooth devices, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! The Bluetooth performance on this phone drops it from great to a disaster. I've had 30 phones or so connected to my car's Bluetooth. I've never had one perform as badly as this one. Every call I make, I have to hit the speaker button and select Bluetooth. Not what you want to be doing when driving. In essence, I can only make calls when stopped. (android auto makes it slightly easier, but still far from safe) For incoming calls, sometimes they route to Bluetooth, often they don't. Then, in the call, the bluetooth connection often drops mid call. I have to pick up the phone and talk into it...which is illegal in Illinois, so I just shout that I'll call back when safe or ask them to hold on for a bit as the Bluetooth will eventually reconnect. This is a major major disappointment in what is supposed to be a premium flagship phone. To be fair...all else is actually pretty great. It feels good in my hand, and I use the camera, extended battery, and car mount mods. (the BT problems started before the car mount...so not related) With 4GB of RAM it is very responsive, and the battery life is outstanding. Like everything though, one major issue has killed my love for this phone. As much as I commute, I need to be able to reliably make and receive calls while driving, and this does not accomplish this basic need.",10.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0

It has all the important and essential features you need and skips the stuff that isn't important from the high-end flagship phones. It works on every US carrier. You can spend more another Android phone but are unlikely to get one much better than this. If you need a phone that will work on Total Wireless, SIMPLE Mobile, Page Plus, etc. this is the phone to buy. - Very solid build quality. It doesn't feel super premium the way a Galaxy or iPhone does, but it feels high end and looks great. - The camera is much improved from the Moto G4. Practically speaking this is the biggest improvement in the phone. The camera no longer feels low-end. The new camera features like spot color work easily. The main weakness of previous MotoG phones have been addressed. - Performance is very good. No lag, everything is responsive. - Screen looks great. - The screen size is narrower than before. This is not an improvement IMO and does take a bit of an adjustment. But after a day or two, it's irrelevant. - As in the past, the Moto gestures are super handy. These are simple and immediately useful. - The fingerprint scanner and facial recognition work without a hitch. - USB-C is very nice to have, and fast charging is appreciated. A standard headphone jack is nice to have too. - Motorola continues to run a clean version of Android with only a couple Moto utilities added on. This is far better than most other manufacturers like Samsung. - The biggest negative is the back of the phone. Yes, it looks nice. But it's glass, which is pointless and a liability. And the back has curved edges that are so smooth the phone is easy to slip through your hand. Thankfully both of these things are handled but getting a case for the phone. - I read that people don't like how Motorola doesn't promise more than one updated Android version. If this is important to you, you pretty much have to spend 2 or 3 times what this device costs. This seems a minor complaint IMO. You will get a solid 18-36 months out of this phone before you start to feel ready for something new and improved.",23.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 (32GB, 3GB RAM) Dual SIM 5.7"" 4G LTE (GSM Only) Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1925-2 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1925-2-Unlocked-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHW5KMY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RO-IMRSvL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHW5KMY,212,118.96,118.97

10929,B01MDMJGYT,Steve F Nevil,5,13-Aug-17,False,Buy it for the battery life. Add a power pack mod to laugh hysterically at other people plugging their phone in to keep them alive,"I have owned this phone and the Incipio Off Grid power pack with wireless charging for about four months now, and I can safely say no other phone comes even remotely close to outlasting it. To clarify, I just finished 'torture testing' my phone because I was curious how long it would take to actually kill the battery. I run a live wallpaper that updates itself to provide real-time satellite photos of the Earth (amazing, but horrible on battery life), and Nova launcher because I like to customize the Android interface. I also have a weather/time/calendar/location info widget running on my home screen that constantly updates. On top of these battery nightmares, I have six month old little boy who is dominating my social media environment by being insanely cute, so use of Instagram and Facebook are at unhealthy levels. Short version - I'm not going easy on the battery. Ever. I took it off it's charger 6am Wednesday. Time of death - 12pm FRIDAY! It's worth noting that the phone ran down to 1% before going down. No surprises. 54 hours. With the smallest power pack available. I have silicone plugs in the bottom ports simply because I never need them for anything. If I remember to put it on it's stand once every couple of days, I'm golden. Top of the line features? Not technically, although the phone doesn't underperform in any respect. Gorgeous display, snappy processing, drastically understated water resistance (this phone has been tested UNDERWATER), an excellent camera (out of the box settings need to be changed - look into that right away), expandable storage (mine is at 232gb and it wasn't expensive), it's the best experience I've ever had with a smartphone.",6.0,Motorola,"Motorola MOTO Z PLAY (XT1635) Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen - 32GB - Black (International Version - No Warranty)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1635-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B01MDMJGYT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YWHpWk7+L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MDMJGYT,161,169.0,0.0

My first major annoyance with this phone was the lack of a physical home button, unlike the iPhone and GS3. After 2 weeks now with the Moto G I've gotten used to that, but it is still a bit annoying that the digital buttons are part of the actual screen. Again, that's not a deal breaker, just kind of weird that it was designed that way, rather than using the extra space below the screen for the buttons. Overall, for 100 bucks, this is a spectacular phone. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is not an 8GB phone, as advertised. The phone comes with a total capacity of 5.52 GB, and about 4.5 available GB after the Kit Kat update. Again, for 100 bucks, I am shocked at how great of a phone this is.

5,B001AO4OUC,MayaMan,1,13-Apr-11,False,Terrible Customer Service,"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

A decent phone for $40 when it'd otherwise cost $400 or more for no reason... So the one downside is it's listed as having 16GB of internal storage.. Apparently that's more like 10 after it's included software and unless you're a programmer there probably isn't much you could do to regain that space.. That being said this phone marks right up there with a lot of the phones that people pay several hundred for.. Next to the newest Iphone or Galaxy s8 or whatever.. Of course it's not up to par next to them. But if you want a phone that can do pretty much anything the others can for a fraction of the cost.. This is the way to go. It starts up quick, the fingerprint reader reads well. The camera seems to about the only complaint I have.. It has room for improvement but for $40 I can't really complain too much. It has problems focusing sometimes though and even just trying to scan barcodes in stores I have issues sometimes.. Other than the camera I can't really find anything to complain about.. I give it a perfect five stars because of the price and the bang for the buck. You'll be hard pressed to find a better deal. YES this phone is locked to Verizon. There are programs online you can use to check a phones compatibility on your network.. If you plan on unlocking this to switch carriers please seek one of those sites out and check to see how compatible it is before even buying it and wasting your money.. Verizon has some awesome prepaid plans though and I read bad things about their prepaid but for the most part I have no issues with it. I notice sometimes playing youtube I get hang ups but I paid $40 for a phone so it's probably the phone.. For the most part though everything is great.. Great signal and great phone. Can't beat it. I don't like the idea of making payments to ""lease"" a phone or so I can even afford to buy one that's for sure! I pay $40 a month for unlimited talk, text, and net.

Granted, the device lacks many gsm bands an actual tmobile phone may have, like band 12 and 66, but if you are in a band 2 or band 4 area, you wont have any issues after you enter the apn settings.

My battery last 2 days. -Screen size is great, I like how small the phone is yet I can watch videos with 4.3 inch screen in HD! -Phone size is small and thin, whole new world of large screened phones. -Fully customizable like all Droids -Beautiful sleek look, aluminum border, kevlar backing, Corning gorilla glass Cons: -because the border is aluminum painted black it will show silver at the edges of the screen with time, but no biggy -not a huge selection of cases and covers available, which is to be expected with any brand new phone -Smart actions app doesn't always work and drains a significant amount of battery life. Cool idea, but it just uses to much power -Now to the only really bad part-For some reason the camera program that comes preloaded in the Razr M doesn't take good pictures at all! But there is a solution my fellow droid users, go to google play store and download ICS+ Camera app. It is only $2.99 and takes perfect pictures. Also it adds a panoramic picture taking function to the phone (Iphone 5 already has preloaded, but o well) Wrap up: All in all, great phone! Best Droid on the market when you consider, screen size, weight, size of phone, os, and battery life. I highly recommend it and let me know if you have any more questions.

9889,B01LEL8ABY,T. Blikstad,4,12-Nov-16,False,"Aside from the waterproof-ness of the Galaxy S7 / iPhone 7, I prefer this phone","I came to this phone from a Moto G first Gen. That phone had 3G, fast enough WiFi, a decent processor for the time, and a 4.5"" screen. I started to notice the slowdown a few months after I updated to Android 5.0, and then it really hit home when I tried to play Pokemon Go. I decided then that I would upgrade my phone when I had the money. I did a LOT of research, so I will try to highlight both what made me choose this phone over others and how it holds up. The processor: This phone has the second-fastest processor available these days, the Snapdragon 820. It does run very smoothly most of the time. Like any phone, it stutters in a very small number of circumstances. For this phone, the only time it slows down is when I start a new message to a person I've never texted before. Kind of obscure, I know. The phone is fast, except for these few times. The screen: I was worried I wouldn't want a phone that was this big (5.5"" screen, with a pretty small screen-to-body ratio). I was worried it wouldn't fit in my pocket. I was wrong. I like the big screen, and it fits just fine in my pocket. Plus, it's gorgeous, and about as high-definition as you could want. I've read reviews that say it's too reflective of a screen on a sunny day, but I disagree. I've also heard it's a fingerprint magnet, but I disagree. It attracts way fewer fingerprints than any other touchscreen I've used. The battery: I've read some bad things about this as well. It does not pack a very big battery, given that most phones pack at least a 3000 mA-hr battery these days. I can't say I'm overly impressed by it either. However, I purchased the Incipio Off-Grid Power Pack, the wireless charging version. With that spare battery on the back, it does two days of moderate use, no problem. The fingerprint reader: this thing is lightning fast. I've read good things about the Nexus phones having ultra-fast fingerprint readers, but I can't imagine it going much faster than this. It doesn't do the thing that Galaxy phones and iPhones do, where they first go to the home screen, think about it for a second, and then finally unlock the phone. It goes straight to your home screen. This doesn't seem like much of a difference (probably only about half a second faster), but think how many times you unlock your phone per day, per week, per year? The Moto Z is where it's at. Side note, though: the fingerprint reader sits on a rather large black ""chin"" on the front of the phone. This does look kind of weird, especially when the three black Android navigation buttons are present on the screen right above the reader. The camera: This is one area where the Moto Z loses to its competition. Both the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 have better cameras. I've also heard good things about the Pixel. The Moto Z has a good camera, don't get me wrong. But it's not the best. If you want examples of photos from its camera, there are lots of reviews online where they took the same picture at the same time with several different phones. I would suggest looking at those for the best comparison. The body: This phone is SLIM. Super slim. When I snap the battery mod on, the whole thing becomes normal-phone sized. So maybe you're thinking, ""yikes, is this phone going to snap in two in my pocket?"" I thought the same, and so I consulted Jerry Rig Everything, a Youtube channel. On the video for this phone, a very strong man (who was able to easily snap the Nexus 6P) tries to break it, and comments how strong it is. I was impressed. Another thing to consider about the body is that the camera is a very large bulge coming out of the back, unless you either attach a mod, or attach the back cover that comes with it. If you want it as thin as possible, you can take everything off. It's just that the camera will stick out like a sore thumb. It's really a stylistic choice for you to make. The headphone jack: Ok, I lied. There is no headphone jack. This is more of a problem than I would have thought before I bought it. They do include an adapter, and it actually produces good sound at a good volume, but if you lose it you're kind of out of luck. There really aren't any spare adapters on the market yet, not even from Motorola. The only ones you can get on Amazon are from Asia somewhere and have some pretty bad reviews. I think as the market catches on, some quality ones will come forward, but for now there are few options. The software: Lenovo (the makers of this Moto phone) does a really good job of leaving the Android experience very clean. The only things they add to it are (generally) helpful. Moto Voice is a female assistant much like Cortana or Siri, and it's useful but it has its quirks. Moto Actions let you turn on the camera or flashlight with specified hand movements; notices when you reach for your phone and lights up the screen; lets you put your phone in ""do not disturb"" by turning it over; and turns the phone's ringer to ""vibrate"" when you pick it up to answer. I turned off a couple of features, and you can turn any of them off if you want: the flashlight seems kind of dangerous, the way they have you shake the phone so hard. Also, there is a feature that allows you to shrink the screen to a smaller size by swiping up from the bottom; I didn't find this to be useful. Other than these features, there are no apps pre-installed on the phone. It's also unlocked for GSM, so you can use it on the two US carriers that use this technology, as well as in many places outside of the US. Be aware that you cannot use it on CDMA networks. Signal/battery issues: I get a good signal at home, but at work, inside the building at my desk, I get nothing whatsoever. The phone appears to search for a signal the whole day, and it causes the battery to drain rather quickly. While you could classify this as a network issue, I wish the phone would stop searching for a signal trying, or at least stop using so much power in searching so often, at least until the signal improves. The ""fast charging"": This phone really does charge fast, and the battery mod is no slouch either. Right now I'm charging it using the Moto charger that came with it, and it went from 22% to 65% in 30 minutes. Then it went up to 93% after a total of 53 minutes. However, all of the flagship phones come with fast charging these days, so it's not a stand-out feature. A side note is that this version of the Incipio battery mod includes wireless charging, but the phone itself doesn't come with it out of the box. On a $700 phone, this should be a standard feature (I'm looking at you, Apple). The memory: This phone has a respectable 4GB of RAM, and a solid 64GB of storage. It also has an SD card slot, which is helpful but I probably will never need it. The waterproof-ness: This phone is basically not waterproof. I think they list it as ""splashproof"", but it does not have a specific IPXX rating. If you want to drop it in the pool or go taking pictures out in a heavy rainstorm, this isn't likely to survive. The Mods: Moto Mods are pretty cool. I have both the battery and the speaker mods, which are both worth the money. I wouldn't buy the camera lens or the projector, because those are too expensive for what you get. I'm hopeful that Moto will continue to push for more Mods. If you have an idea for one, by the way, Motorola has development kits to speed you on your way; they want Mods to become a prolific thing! The price: This phone is priced the same as the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, so it's clear they're targeting the same folks. When I got one, the clincher that put me over the edge is that they took $150 off of the price in order to undercut Samsung and Apple. It was a limited time offer, and it may not be available by the time you read this. I do believe that the $550 I paid was worth it. On a side note, the Galaxy S7 is coming available this Black Friday at Best Buy for the same price. However, I'm not too disappointed I chose Moto. The screen is bigger, the capabilities are expandable, and I've always liked Moto phones. The verdict: I like this phone. If it was priced at $550 all the time, I would give it five stars. At $700 it's too expensive for what you get. But hey, aren't the iPhone and the Galaxy the same way? In the end the choice is yours between this and the other flagships, but aside from the waterproof features of the S7 / iPhone 7, I prefer this phone. EDIT 11/29/16: After having this phone for almost a month, I wanted to add just one detail: the camera lens scratches WAY too easily. I can't keep my keys in the same pocket as my phone anymore. They don't scratch the screen even remotely, but they scratch the camera lens SO easily. Not a huge deal, but a letdown nonetheless. It doesn't change my rating, but it slightly sways the argument towards buying another flagship phone over this one.",22.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0
5348,B00OZTSY6Y,Nathaniel Allen,5,12-Nov-14,False,"Droid on 'roids! Solid Maxx update w/ some bugs, and the battery is not all there...","I moved to the Turbo from last year's Droid Maxx. My prior phone was a Galaxy Nexus. Strung together, these phones represent a continuation of Google's post-Gingerbread aesthetic, when the Android OS really began to take user interface design seriously. Each of these devices run close-to-stock versions of Android (unfortunately 4.4.4 KitKat for the Turbo at launch), without the heavy, increasingly unnecessary skins by the names of Touch Wiz, Sense, Xpria, and MotoBlur. __________ Construction: The Turbo is somewhat unremarkable, and maybe plain, but ugly? Eye of the beholder and all, but... No. It certainly doesn't have the fashion sense of the Moto X, nor the industrial refinement of the HTC One. From the front, it's very similar to the Maxx. The primary visual differences are the smoked chrome bezel, and the front-facing ""eyebrow"" speaker that easily goes unnoticed. The always-present capacitive buttons were a conservative, questionable decision by Verizon, and like 'em or hate 'em, the phone will be stuck with them and be ""instantly outdated"" upon the update to Lollipop, when the button design will be changed to a Playstation-esq triangle, circle and square. The back of my 64 GB model is the ""ballistic nylon"" textured finish. First, I don't really believe that this is laid-up weave integrated with the phone. The pattern is too precise, too ""aligned and centered"" for me to go along with that -- I believe it's simply a back made of plastic (ok, fine, nylon, polymer, whatever...), with the simulated weave pattern molded in, replicating a heavy canvas-like material. I expected this textured finish to be ""grippier,"" i.e. less prone to slipping and dropping, than the smooth Kevlar back of my Droid Maxx, but quite the opposite is true: with the gentle way we hold, no, *cradle* our phones, maybe there's less surface contact between the fingertips and phone's back, but whatever the reason, the Turbo is more prone to sliding away. If you're at all clumsy and not planning to encase this device, it's worth checking out in-store. As it is, the ballistic nylon is the only option if you're opting for the 64 GB model. The 64GB model is void of any Verizon branding, other than a sensible DROID logo on the back (a Verizon trademark). Even the classic ""angry red"" Droid boot animation and default background has been toned down. No longer does the phone croak a robotic ""Droooooiiid"" during boot. _____ Phone: Call quality is exactly what I expect from Motorola. The sound is clear, the mics seem good judging by what the people I'm talking to are saying (it's not, ""You're scratchy -- say that again?""). No problem with the Bluetooth functionality in my vehicles. The dialer is the recently updated white background, Material Design-themed version, and it's really snappy and responsive. It's funny to say that about a dial pad, but it really stands out to me how quick it is to respond to my finger press, and more importantly, my finger release -- previous dial pads have always had a bit of lag when I lift my finger to move to the next key. It sounds minor, but is in reality a big improvement in usability. ______ Screen: While I don't spend a lot of time ogling my phone, I *DO* look at my screen. The Maxx took a lot of heat last year for its 720p screen, when 1080p devices were all the rage. Personally, I found the 720 screen to be quite adequate, and I'm sure it helped with the battery-sipping properties of that model. However, I'll have to admit that the QHD display is absolutely stunning on the Turbo, even when watching 720p content on YouTube. But the extra resolution doesn't do me a bit of good on certain web sites where I hoped to most take advantage of it -- for instance, my local newspaper's web app, which only generates lower-res images of the paper for browsing. However, on text-heavy sites such as ARS Technica, where white text is displayed against a black background, GONE is the effect of the letters dimming when the screen is scrolled. Clearly, the technology driving this AMOLED screen has been refined. If you've fooled around at all with Google's ""Cardboard"" virtual reality goggles, this high res screen translates well, with individual pixels just perceptible enough to let you know they're there, without ruining the illusion. (Unfortunately, the magnetic switch on the goggles doesn't play well with the Turbo.) The screen, it's worth mentioning, has proven to be extremely oleophobic. My Maxx's screen was constantly obscured by finger smudges, while the Turbo stays very much unimpaired. I don't know if this is a coating that will eventually lose effectiveness, or is an innate property the glass, but I'm happy have it. ________ Sound: Perhaps my biggest criticism of the Maxx was the rear-firing, over-tasked speaker. It sounded over-driven from day one, with just a bit too much distortion at full volume. By contrast, the front firing speaker on the Turbo is not only facing the correct direction, but its output is crystal clean. Love it! It doesn't pack the volume to fill a room, and struggles to compete with the sounds of my morning shower with the exhaust fan running. But around the house, it's excellent for personal listening, and I can listen to a newscast from a room away. The speaker is is audible for in-car navigation, even over the radio at reasonable volume settings. Just don't expect it to be LOUD. ______ Radios: I'm sorry to report that the cellular and WiFi radios aren't as strong as those in the Maxx. I have a few reliable, repeatable ""dead spots"" in specific locations at home, work, and my favorite watering hole. Last year's Maxx surprised me and pulled weak but workable signals. With the Turbo, I'm back to no reception at these locations (one is a test of WiFi reception; the others of 3G/4G). This isn't a deal breaker, just a test of the functional limits of radio technology. But remember, the Maxx achieved the dubious notoriety as THE PHONE with the highest radiation output in 2014 -- if you concern yourself with that sort of data. I guess the trade-off there was exceptional radio range. On the topic of radios, in December the Turbo received an update to Verizon's ""Advanced Calling,"" aka VoLTE, i.e. ""Voice over LTE."" If you're out and about, AND have a 4G connection, this phone will do simultaneous voice and data -- and at the same time provides a really nice voice connection to other Verizon users utilizing this feature. However, if the phone loses 4G, it drops the call. If you're in a 3G or 1x area and initiate a phone call while navigating or streaming music, you'll get an error message that the data connection was lost. If you're in range of a WiFi connection, voice + data are no problem. ______ Battery: Let's just say that battery life claims should always be viewed with skepticism. That's why I was surprised when last year's Maxx pretty much met Motorola's claimed 48-hour target. It's also why I'm surprised that the Turbo doesn't. Despite having an extra 400mAh under the hood (3900mAh battery, vs. 3500 in the Maxx), it has to drive a screen with 4x the resolution. Different processor, different launch OS, different features -- however this tallies up, my Maxx is comfortably an all-day ""plus"" phone (and I have my share of 24-plus hour days), which can include an hour of GPS navigation, an hour plus of video, some audio streaming, and lots of web usage -- much of it in an LTE-only environment. For my purposes, the all day battery is just great, but the Maxx (at launch) ran circles around the Turbo. The included Motorola ""Turbo Charger"" is the perfect solution to pumping another 16% into the battery in a mere 15 minutes, compared with a 6% boost from a non-Turbo charger from Motorola. At the discharge rates I'm experiencing, that's about 4 to 5 hours of additional usage time. Carried over from the Maxx is the built-in wireless charging using the Qi standard. Although you'll need to pick up a compatible charging stand separately, the Tylt Vu has no problem taking this huge battery from zero to 100 in less than 5 hours. ______ Camera: The out-of-the box camera experience is good, with some surprises. Moto's very useful ""twist to activate"" feature is present -- if you're not familiar, it's a simple trick to torque my wrist twice (like turning a door knob) to call up the camera app. Because of this, I live without a camera icon on my home screen, as the quick motion opens the app nearly instantly, even when asleep and locked. Overall, exposure, color, and focus are excellent -- I take no exception with the output quality, although I do call into the question the obscene 21 MP photo size. Long-pressing the screen to capture multiple shots in continuous drive mode results in a seriously impressive burst rate of 5 frames per second, but I am disappointed the first shot takes about 1.5 to 2 seconds to capture -- that's a bit slow, though I hope can be addressed in a future firmware update. __________ Performance: I'll leave it to the tech sites to relate benchmark data from the Turbo's chipset (which, from the ones I've read, show it on top of the heap of current devices). Here are some real life day-to-day observations. Boot time is 26 seconds to lock screen, and 35 seconds to ""ready to use."" Facebook initialization (after downloading a FB app update, for instance) was literally taking minutes on the Maxx (you can read users complaining about this in the app's reviews). On the Turbo, this ""blue screen"" initialization time has been reduced to less than 15 seconds. In general, task switching and in-app page changes are instant. The hallmark of an overtasked processor is when I realize that I'm waiting for an animation to take place during a task switch or in-app page change. None of that here. It's an all-around fluid visual experience. Dalvik runtime is the default at launch. I haven't tried ART on the Turbo, and will probably wait until Lollipop to do so, but I was running ART on my Maxx for the last few months without any hiccups. ______ Memory: Google has definitely stepped away from expandable memory via SD slots, as evidenced by the last few generations of Nexus devices, and it seems that Verizon and Motorola are both on that train. Like the Maxx before it, the Turbo has no expandable memory, but the 64GB option should make amends to SD diehards. At a $50 price premium, it's a relatively good deal considering most phones up to now charge that much to upgrade from 16GB to 32. There is good news. The Maxx is OTG (""On The Go"") compatible, via the micro USB slot. This means the phone natively supports my Leef microUSB reader, so I can still easily swap files should I have the need. The Leef device is postage stamp small, about matchbook thick, so it's not something that would be left plugged in all the time. But its presence wouldn't hamper watching movies on the airplane, or plugging in extra tunes in the car (except it blocks the USB port from accepting a power cable). ______________ Operating System: These comments will lose their substance quickly, as I expect the Turbo to transition to Lollipop in short order. Additionally, as Motorola perfected with the Maxx, they have a great deal of control over various functions of the OS that previously would have been ""baked in,"" requiring an OS refresh -- Moto has shifted much of that to the app side, and is able to make ongoing improvements through Google Play. Case in point: ""OK Google Now"" commands were initially answered with, ""Opening Google..."" before reading or displaying results. Less than a week into ownership, Moto updated their Moto Voice app to eliminate that small annoyance. There have likewise been minor app updates to Moto Actions and Connect. Present are all of the Moto goodies: Active display (notifications displayed on-screen while the phone is in standby mode), Moto Voice (""OK Google Now"" or a phrase of my choosing to wake), Moto Actions (senses if I'm driving, sleeping, in a meeting, etc. and adjusts behavior accordingly, i.e. reading text messages aloud in the car and prompting me to respond by voice dictation). ""Attentive Display"" optionally uses the front camera to sense whether the screen is being looked at to remain on -- and it works well, but in practice is only useful with screen timeout settings in the 30 second to 1 minute range. ""Trusted Devices"" carries over, allowing the bypass of the lock screen when connected to a known Bluetooth device; alas, this feature still doesn't work with WiFi, so I continue to disable it and use the excellent SkipLock app instead. The OS is devoid of any skin-over, and as Moto has been doing for the past two years, is about as close to stock Android as can be hoped for -- just a few minor tweaks in the Settings menu. Verizon got their bloatware, but it's only present in the form of applications, which can easily be disabled and hidden from view. You'll find the usual pre-installed Amazon, Audible, IMDB, NFL, Softcard (ISIS mobile payments) apps in there, in addition to Verizon's Cloud, Message+, VZ Navigator (really, Verizon?!?) and others -- I've rolled back and disabled 15 pre-installed apps in total, though they can't be completely deleted, so remain present in memory. The apps I most use that potentially get ""under the skin"" of Android are all work without drama: Nova Launcher, Sound Profile, Skip Lock, and Swype keyboard. ____ Bugs: Thankfully, not too many. This mostly picks up where the Maxx left off. I've had the odd case of the clock, WiFi, and signal strength icons showing up upside down on the left side of my status bar. On occasion YouTube video playback freezes while the audio continues. There have been a few ""low battery"" shutdowns when I'm at 30% remaining, and launch something processor-intensive such as Google Earth, YouTube, or Cardboard -- but these have been isolated, non-repeatable instances where the phone picks right back up after reboot. All-in-all, I haven't experienced any recurring stability issues, random reboots, or missed calls. _______ Summary: If you're already a Droid Maxx user, or have the S5 or HTC ONE or newer, there is probably limited justification in picking up the Turbo. The Turbo's upped screen res, fast processor, and forward firing speaker are nice, but the Maxx remains a very usable device, with a Lollipop commitment from Motorola. The biggest knocks against the Turbo are notable: battery life is nowhere near what's claimed, and the camera is very slow to fire its first shot. I'm wavering between 4 and 5 stars for my rating, but the truth is, I *love* the phone, despite the shortcomings I've listed. Added together, all of these refinements over the previous generation make for an appealing update to an already solid phone.",110.0,Motorola,"Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-Turbo-Ballistic-Wireless/dp/B00OZTSY6Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VMO0UpxfL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00OZTSY6Y,545,149.99,0.0

1283,B0096QYH80,Anonymous#1337,5,12-Nov-12,False,Don't miss my iPhone,"The phone is perfect IMO. Larger screen phones are just too big to be 'phones', and smaller screen phones (even my previously owned, only slightly smaller iPhone 4) are difficult to work with as smartphones. Battery life isn't quite as good as the iPhone, even taking the slightly larger screen into consideration. By the end of the day I'm averaging 10-20% less battery power remaining than I would be using the iPhone. Fortunately I don't live on my phone so I'm never in danger of draining it. App selection on the Play Store is very good, and has some unique offerings missing from the heavily restrictive iTunes store. All the apps I used on the iPhone have Android versions, and most cost nothing or were a fraction of the iTunes store cost (for example my birding app is $30 on itunes, $10 on android). Beware that there's a learning curve coming from Apple's iWorld to Android, but anyone able to download and manage apps on the iPhone will not have difficulty learning the new way of doing things. Just be patient as your brain needs to be retrained. Use is very stable and the recent apps view is useful for quick switching between apps. Call quality is very good, noticed how much clearer this phone on Verizon is versus my iPhone on AT&T.

18812,B07CHWMYHP,JK,5,12-May-19,True,LOVE MY NEW MOTO G 6 PLUS!!!,"[I live in the US in the Carolinas] Day 1- the phone came in it's original box it did include it's own charger and cable (it didn't mention it would come with these two items as some reviews said it might not) It did have a few settings popping up in Spanish but not all (some reviews mentioned this detail but I am fluent in Spanish so it didn't bother me) The set up was pretty quick. I had a Moto 5 gs Plus so all that data transfered perfectly. I saw some people mentioned it didn't work with T-Mobile or that the sound was bad or that Bluetooth wouldn't work. I, luckily, did not have any of these issues. If you are new to the Moto phones, you may want to get used to learning the Moto settings app (which is it's own app rather than in the settings icon) to turn on/off some actions or settings. All other phone settings didn't give me a problem. The physical features are very nice. The texture of the phone on the back feels very sleek and durable but light. I got the deep marine blue (or indigo whatever) and the color is very nice . I'm not a fan of the color blue but it looks fantastic on this phone. The front of the phone has a very nice interface. I try not to use my phone without a screen protector but using the bare screen is a great feeling. The audio jack and charging port are at the bottom which is nice. If you have your phone sitting in your pocket and a liquid or anything like that falls on you, it won't fall directly into these openings. The Sim card port is on the top and has multiple sizes for multiple Sim cards. The finger scanner is pretty neat. It's one of those newer types that's smaller and barely feels like an indention and can scan easily. It has the face recognition security scan but that's too creepy for me. I don't want it on. The camera is crisp. I like it. I use it every now and then. I'm not too picky. Honestly, if you want an excellent picture, get a Samsung or better yet buy a dedicated camera. Space on this phone is great. Speed and handling multiple apps is fast. I like using this phone for work and documents and it handles it wonderfully. Battery life depends on usage so, keep it over 30% and try to turn it off while it charges and the phone will have a long battery life. The speakers and mic work fine. I played music on them and I took a phone call on speaker without an issue. While on a regular phone call, I could actually hear the person next to the guy I was talking to. Using LTE for T-Mobile hasn't been an issue. I have down loaded items using my data and it downloaded just fine. I haven't had issues with my phone. Honestly, I was expecting a bad experience but it's been nothing but great! 👌🏿I did see some other customers had issues after 30days (coincidentally that's the same expiration for the Amazon warranty on the phone) I will up load a follow up review after then.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 Plus - 64GB - 5.9"" FHD+, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1926-7 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Plus-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHWMYHP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511i4Qx+e2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHWMYHP,185,174.94,184.99

Phone was nice and solid (I like the fingerprint unlock) but the Interface leaves a lot to be desired. Phone app is horrible compared to Samsung phones. You cant even hold a number and choose ""Add to Contacts"". After using Samsung Note 3 for the past 3 years, I realized the UI is not well polished and easy to use. There are very few options in settings such as hands free mode or reading mode, blocking mode etc. Note 3 had so many possibilities that it puts the Z play to shame. Just the camera app alone is so sparse with options that I would not recommend it. And to make things worse since I got this phone I had to do 3 system updates and every time I did, it tells me there is another system update waiting to be downloaded !

It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone.

24823,B07RB78W37,Xanthene,4,12-Jun-19,False,Great addition to the Z line. Good value vs performance,"Like many I was disappointed to find there would not be a Force edition with a more powerful processor. After using the phone for a while my disappointment faded. The slower processor with help with battery life and i hope to get 3 years out of the phone. I upgraded from original Z1 Force which has served me well for 3 years now. Having invested in many mods it was a no brainer to stay with the Z series and I hope this will not be the final release. The interface is almost the same as the Z force with a few minor exceptions. Having no bloatware and a raw android experience is exactly what I wanted. The bells and whistles on this phone are the mods, worthless voice assistants and proprietary overlays annoy me so this hits all my needs. The screen is bright and crisp and is almost bezzleless with the notched top and bottom buttons that only display when needed. The finger print sensor is behind the screen and is nice to not have it take up space like it did on the z1. It is responsive and blinks red if it's not getting a good reading so you don't have to wait for it to deny you before adjusting. The processor is fast enough for me to run SWGOH and MSF with no hiccups or frame drops. It loads much faster than the z1. No problems or delays with any app I've thrown at it yet. Bluetooth in my car is more stable and small hiccups i heard with my old phone are gone. Why 4 stars and not 5? While they put back in a 3.5mm headphone jack, they did not include a set of earbuds with the phone. It's the first phone i bought that did not come with a set. Mods fit perfectly... too perfectly. When i use the JBL speaker it feels unsafe without a bumper case and as of now there is no official or third party bumper cases that are mod compatible. The adaptive brightness could use a little tweaking. It feels too bright sometimes and too dim others. manually doing the brightness can be difficult in the sun with glare.

5364,B00OZTSY6Y,Alive and Well,3,12-Jun-15,False,READ ABOUT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE YOU BUY!!,"So I was upgrading from my Droid 4. The biggest thing on my mind was that I needed power. I run many productivity apps that my Droid 4 became sluggish (even after I do a wipe each month). After receiving this directly from Verizon and testing it out this is what I found: PROS: 2.7GhZ CPU (@ 4cores - not 8), 3GB RAM, 32GB space - plenty for anyone not planning on watching media (holds a good amount of music), the images are astonishingly vivid and crisp on the screen. Weight quite light (for its size). The camera is very nice at 21MPx but I don't use the camera features on my phones. CONS: This is where I wished I had really read the reviews prior to purchasing. The GUI sucks in this version of Android, I (along with dozens of others have immediately (literally upon turning the device on) installed a custom loader page. The icons and configuration makes me feel like I'm using a device from 10 years ago. Use a 3rd party GUI to fix that. There is NO slot for an expansion card. The speaker is on the front (unlike the Droid 4 which had a separate audio speaker on the back). This speaker is also very weak. Tested several audio samples on both devices (Droid 4 vs Turbo). The Turbo's sound quality simply sucks; almost unbearable for a device that is supposed to have this perk (play audio and video). The Droid 4 is much much stronger. A personal issue for me is that the charge port is on the bottom portion of the phone. Since I like using the Verizon belt clip and case, having the port on the bottom when the kickstand has the phone standing tall is not too pleasing - but not relevant for most. If you are looking to use it for basic activities, then this is great - has lots of power with a few tweaks to customize it to your liking. But this device is not for those who like to have many options to tweak. This phone comes with some crappy stock configurations and 1/2 of the media quality (video - not sound). I know there are a few other phones with the same 3GB of RAM but slightly less CPU (~2.1-2.5GhZ).

24799,B07RB78W37,Kiro,5,12-Jul-19,True,Coming from a Moto Z Play the Moto Z4 is a solid upgrade,"Don't listen to all the negative attention this phone has been getting from mainstream reviewers that are putting this phone down because it doesn't sport the fastest processor on the market or that it still supports moto mods. Its like saying in order to browse the internet on your computer you have to buy an expensive gaming rig with an I9 processor even though you just need a cheap I3 that perfectly does the job. Does it make any sense to buy a flagship phone just for the specs when processors have gotten fast enough that the fastest is just not necessary anymore? Your just wasting your money if you buy into the fastest processor nonsense. Motorola is smart, they are trying to make a phone that is practical, affordable and high quality all at the same time. I know there are other phones similarly priced with better specs but the reason I choose this phone over the others is the moto mods which is the whole point of this phone. I'm coming from a Moto Z Play which i sadly broke and was forced to upgrade and knew right away going back to the Z line of phones was a no brainier considering the great experience i had with my Z Play. So far my experience with the Z4 has been great. The phone feels solid and the processor is quick and handles all tasks i throw at it with ease. Aside from the obvious features like the beautiful OLED screen or the much applauded return of the headphone jack, what sets this phone apart is the gesture support, the always on display and the moto mods. These three things are what made me want to invest in another Z phone and have made me a loyal Motorola customer. The gestures and convenience of the always on display to see your notifications put this phone on another level in terms of practicality and usability. You don't realize how useful and easier your whole experience is with these features is until you try to use another phone without them. The mods are another great way to add super functionality to this phone. The whole point of the mods are to accentuate certain features that one may find useful in every day life to add to their experience and there are mods to fit everyone's tastes. For example since I'm a power user battery life is very important to me. The convenience of having an extra battery mod you can just slap onto the phone to get you through the day without having battery anxiety is such a relief. I constantly hear that the phone is not worth it from other online reviewers since mods are expensive, but the phone is priced in such a way that most real world users would probably stick to one or two mods that really add value to their phone experience so essentially it works out as if your paying a for a flagship phone in the end but with a far more superior experience with the mod you need. As long as Motorola keeps making a Z phone compatible with the current mods they are a good investment as they can be used in future phone upgrades. Also people like myself are more inclined to stay with Motorola phones as a result and the investment one makes pays off in the end. The only gripe i do have with the mods is that they are hard to officially obtain unless you go on eBay and pay inflated prices due to lack of availability on many of the mods through official channels. I think Motorola needs to improve the availability of the mods if they are to continue making modular phones and want people to invest more in them and take the Z line more seriously. Another point I've seen reviewers crap on this phone for is its design and how the moto mods keep it from being innovative but the reality is that there's no need to break compatibility with the mods in order to slightly change the shape and size of the phone when its perfectly fine the way it is and Motorola has been able to evolve and refine the phone with every new generation using the same form factor. They did however slightly change the curve of the bezel on the back so the mods don't sit flush as they did on previous Z phones. I'll admit that at first the small gap did feel weird when i slapped a mod onto the Z4 but i found myself quickly getting used to the small change and its something i can live with. The final and most important thing i want to talk about is the in display finger print sensor since many people seem to have trouble getting it to properly work. At first i had trouble getting the finger print sensor to accurately scan my finger and unlock the phone. It was probably unlocking with a 50% failure rate which was very frustrating but i found the solution that has made it work 100% of the time, yes I said 100%. The trick is to not follow the on screen instructions to scan your fingers at different angles. Just keep scanning your fingers at the same angle you would as if you would normally unlock your phone over and over till its done scanning. This method actually worked and now the in display sensor is just as accurate and fast as it was on my original Z play. So the sensor actually works great and is very accurate as long as you follow my unofficial instructions. So if your one of the many having problems try re-scanning with this method and you'll see the difference too. The facial unlock feature is also very fast and accurate and i also have that enabled as an additional convenience. Overall I'm very pleased with this phone and hope that Motorola continues to keep the Z line alive in the future. The direction Motorola is going in with the Z line by making it a premium upper mid-range modular phone is a win in my opinion. This is the only way the mods will stand the test of time by keeping costs reasonable with this phone. The Z4 has a place in today's competitive market by offering something different and clearly Motorola is doing something right with the Z line of phones now that they have gone into a 4th generation with the modular phone design past their initial 3 year promise. Whether your using this phone with a mod or on its own its a really good phone either way and you wont be disappointed.",37.0,Motorola,"Moto Z4 – Unlocked – 128 GB – Flash Gray (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, Metro - PAF60007US",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Z4-Unlocked-Warranty-PAF60007US/dp/B07RB78W37,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81POiya5gbL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RB78W37,60,399.99,499.99

G7 bad - battery doesn't last all day (large screen doesn't help), reception (speeds weren't great and wifi doesn't always switch over to closest AP), 1 speaker has rather low volume, and no wifi calling on Verizon (not Moto's fault as carrier decides which unlocked phones gets all their features so check carrier here as I believe ATT has wifi calling with this same phone). Overall a good phone at the price. I decided to spend the extra $100 and return for a Pixel 3A, which excels in the areas where the G7 is bad. Both are running pure Android, with a few useful extra Moto features/apps on the G7.

5400,B00TFAVFL4,Kaibob,5,12-Jul-15,True,Excellent budget phone,"The phone I purchaed was a 2nd generation unlocked Moto E with LTE. Amazon was the seller and the price was $99.99 plus tax. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this phone. As a budget phone, and with major consideration given to value for money, I have rated it at 5 stars. I have included below some random thoughts on the phone. I'm on the AT&T network and live in a somewhat remote area with marginal reception. I previously used an iPhone 4S, which got a usable signal in the living room of my house, and several months ago I purchased and then returned an iPhone 6, which would not make reliable calls from anywhere in my house. Fortunately, the Moto E is marginally better than the 4S in making phone calls from my house. The call quality with the Moto E is decent. Voices sound a bit scratchy but are clear and easily understood. The volume when using both the phone's regular speaker and speakphone are quite good. The screen of the Moto E has a resolution of only 245 PPI. This concerned me, but I have found everything on the screen--including very small text--to be quite legible. When I first received the phone, it seemed sluggish. I disabled everything that might slow the phone and it now seems significantly faster. Realistically, though, you can only expect so much with a phone at this price. There was a learning curve but I generally like Android. I especially like the back, home, and running-app buttons at the bottom of the screen. This is much better than the single button at the bottom of my iPhone. The Moto E only has 8GB of storage with 5GB available when I first powered on the phone. For many people this is probably not enough. After installing all of my apps, I now have 3GB free, and I still have the option of installing an SD card if things get tight. I would like more storage but I can live with this. It's probably of no importance to most people but I really like that the phone has a flat display. This makes the installation of screen protectors simple and allows the screen protector to cover essentially the entire screen. All in all, a nice little phone.",5.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto E (2nd Generation) Locked Cellphone, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Locked-Cellphone/dp/B00TFAVFL4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T5JR5djdL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00TFAVFL4,1,0.0,0.0

1292,B0096QYH80,Airhawk,2,12-Jan-14,False,Be wary and do your research!,"I did not buy my M from Amazon and instead went to the Verizon, yet I am here to inform potential buyers about some possible headaches when buying this phone. I originally upgraded from a basic slide phone to this to get started in the smartphone world. I wanted a Casio one that was waterproof but the salesman convinced me to get this, saying it was faster and not as buggy... Well... Pros: - Heavy, solid build - DROID - MicroSD port Cons: - Software (as of 1/12/2014, ALL M's are stuck on Android 4.1.2 with no word on updates) - Speaker goes out very quickly - Super slow - Not enough RAM Let me start with the cons of this phone. First, the software. As Google announces 4.4 KitKat, Motorola users have been stuck on 4.1.2 or thereabouts for well over a year. The OS is old, buggy, and apps are starting to have issues. You can try to get 4.4 unofficially by ""rooting"" your phone, which, as of the most recent updates, is impossible. So if you're looking into getting into custom ROMs and hacking your phone, this isn't the one for you. The speakers. After about 2 months of having the phone (and not rooting it), I would answer a call and nothing. Just silence. I would hang up and dial the number again and I wouldn't even hear the dial tones you get when the other person's phone is ringing. I'd check my phone and yep, it's connected to the other person. I would get a text back that they could hear me. I've reset my phone countless times in an attempt to solve the issue. After some quick research, Verizon refuses to acknowledge the issue and blames Motorola, and vice versa. Shortly after that went, my speaker on the back went, meaning if I got a call and my phone wasn't on vibrate, I'd miss it. Speed. It's very very laggy once you actually get your phone up and running. Even texting can be a challenge on this phone. It'll freeze when switching conversations and even opening the basic included app. I've tried others and the included app is /the/ fastest, least glitchy one. You can't play any games that require any amount of graphics other than solitaire. Videos and movies are ok though. The pros! It is solidly built. After the speaker had already broken, I accidentally dropped my phone from about chest high and it was fine (with an OtterBox). The screen didn't crack and the buttons still work. DROID. Who doesn't like that DRRROOOOOIIID sound? MicroSD. I've been looking at other phones and some of them do NOT have a MicroSD slot. For example, the new Moto X comes in only 8 and 16 gig versions (actual usable space is less) and there's no slot for a MicroSD. So if you want to listen to music without streaming over the network and running your battery down and data rates up, you can only keep some songs, maybe a movie. So, to wrap things up, the phone has points for the MicroSD slot, DROID sound, and build quality minus the speakers. It looses points for software OS not being upgraded, speakers have short life expectancies, it's very slow, and not enough RAM.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

After 6 hours of Pokemon the battery is only down to 15% which is when the battery saver kicks in. The battery can last two days if you aren't constantly on Pokemon Go. I used to carry a battery pack when I go play Pokemon Go, now I don't. The answered questions both say dual and non dual sim. I took a gamble and hoped for a dual sim. And it is a dual sim nano. I'm ready to travel the world and catch those regional Pokemons. Well Maybe. I wish. Next, next, next year maybe. Depending on funds. :( The camera is great. You can choose beetween the tap the whole screen or tap shutter button. I chose to tap the shutter button so I won't confuse those who are used to iPhones or other Android. I swiped from the left just like on Moto X only to see the most basic simplistic options. But when I clicked the camera button, it is actually more advanced. It has Professional Mode, Slow Motion, Panorama, Video and Photo. In Profesional mode, you can set the focus mode, White Balance, Exposure time, ISO, and exposure compensation. You couldn't do that on Moto X. And yeah it can do 4K videos. This camera model only has one storage size option and that is 32GB. My Moto X had 64GB which was the highest option. 32GB is still big enough for most casual gamer, app installer. Of course you can add in an Micro SD card if you want. It's got front mono speaker as is standard with all of the most resent Motorolas. Or should I say Lenovo Moto. Not dual speaker like my older Moto X. It's mono speaker and the is located on the top of the screen. A downgrade from the Moto X but hey battery life. It's still loud enough. Cases are hard to shop for.

Hendricks,5,12-Dec-15,True,Great Development Phone,"I use this phone as a development phone (so I'm using it on wifi only), but I think it would be a great primary phone as well (this coming from an iPhone user). I like the size of it - not too small, not too big - and the screen is surprisingly clear and bright. I just upgraded it to Lollipop 5.1 and it is running smoothly and responsively. I chose this phone over the Moto E because the screen is bigger (however, if you want Android 6, you'll want to get a newer generation of this phone if you don't want to hack it). Developers only: As mentioned, I'm using this as a development phone to test web sites and apps. Unfortunately (at least the one that was shipped to me), it is the 2013/Falcon model, so Lollipop 5.1.1 is the highest version of Android that is supported. However, if you are savvy, you can install CyanogenMod CM13 *at your own risk*. (Note: To get past the activation screen nag the first time, I had to scroll down the ""notification bar"" dropdown from the top, which caused the bottom buttons to appear. Then I used the recent screens/task button on the right to close the activation app. Pros: - Price is excellent for the phone quality - Nice size, very crisp and bright screen - Seems fast and responsive (I have no complaints) - I was able to upgrade to Lollipop without activating the phone Cons: - Only 8GB of storage (which is fine with me as a dev phone) - Highest version of Android supported without a custom mod (on the one that was shipped to me) is 5.1.1 Lollipop",1.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0
5281,B00OZTSY6Y,S. J. Eckles,5,12-Dec-14,False,WOW! What a Phone!,"This is a great phone! I just moved up from a Droid RAZR M a little over a week ago. I wanted a phone with a bigger screen, better photo capability and larger internal memory than the RAZR. And I have not been disappointed at all! I can read much easier on the big screen. Since the phone is larger than the RAZR, I have to get accustomed to using my fingers a little differently to Swype, but I'm learning quickly. The photos are excellent, and the phone automatically reads any text that's within the photo (like the name on the side of a truck), turns it into text, and adds it to the file description of the photo. The 64 GB of memory is incredible! I had run out of space for apps on my old phone (only 8 GB). When I got the Turbo, I loaded it with all the apps I wanted, and I've still only used about 5% of the available memory. I don't need an SD card, because all my documents, music and photos are on OneDrive. And I wasn't particularly looking for more battery charging capability. I have chargers in my house, purse and car because I was always charging the RAZR M. (If I wasn't retired, I'd have a charger at work, too.) But I have noticed that I'm charging the Turbo less than the old phone. Some people have complained about low volume on Turbo calls. I have found that my phone has much better volume and sound quality than my old phone. My husband is hard of hearing and I always had to use my speakerphone when I called him, but no more! He can hear me very clearly with the normal phone volume. And it's plenty loud and clear for me, too.

I don't want a big unwieldy cell phone like the Galaxy S III or Droid DNA, so having a screen this size in a phone that still comfortably fits my hand is wonderful. I recommend the phone to almost anyone, but it is important to know something going in. This phone completely lacks the ability to move applications from internal storage to the SD card. Even third-party applications such as App2SD cannot do so, as they only streamline the native process. That being said, the phone has ample internal memory, roughly 4.6GB, which is far more than I need for my applications at this time, and I imagine a long time to come. It is absolutely worth investing in an additional SD card, though, for storing music and video files. The SD card slot is very easily-accessed on the side of the phone, as well, so that's a plus. The only people I imagine would find substantial disappointments with this phone are serious tinkerers, and even then only a few of them.

1282,B0096QYH80,DigiKill,5,12-Dec-12,False,Best phone I've ever owned.,"RECOMMENDED! I've owned a lot of phones over the last 15 years. So far this is my favorite. The latest skin by Motorola is quick, smooth, and substantially less intrusive than previous Motoblur skins. I love the quick access settings menu, and that I can create unlimited application screens. Battery life is great! Individual results will vary, but so long as you don't have a million services running in the background, you should go a full day on a charge. Some friends of mine aren't so lucky with older RAZR models. They had to buy extended batteries, or keep a charger with them. Having mentioned batteries; you can't open this model. That is, the battery is sealed inside the phone. You do have easy access to the SIM and MicroSD card slots. The best feature in my opinion is the Motorola Smart Actions application (included on the phone). It's like a slimmed down version of the ""Tasker"" app. Smart Actions allow monitoring of simple conditions to manage battery life, messages, profiles, or locations. For example, IF I'm at home, and its after 10pm, and the phone hasn't been picked up in 10 minutes, THEN turn off the ringer, disable WiFi and Mobile Data, and auto reply to incoming text messages. It's really handy. The screen is AMOLED and quite beautiful. Since each pixel generates light individually, black is OFF and thus truly black. There is no back light. I've been using the phone for about four months and I've had no problems. The local Verizon 4G LTE network gives me a blazing 21 Mbps download (faster than my home internet!), and gets great signal. The only downside is the camera. It takes O.K. photos. The photos seem a little fuzzy (like someone painted them) under high zoom. The HDR mode does take nice photos in low light, and the macro capabilities are decent. The new panoramic feature in Android 4.1+ is less than great. Very rarely do the photos stitch together well, and usually the blurriness is horrible. Data access priority is a bit of a pet peeve. If WiFi and Mobile Data are both turned on, the phone will prioritize access via the WiFi. If you enter a building or area with free WiFi access, the phone will connect automatically. The issue I find annoying is often these free access networks require you to accept terms of service (TOS) via a redirected web page before the network grants you access to the internet. So you ARE connected to the WiFi hotspot, but not the internet. If for example you quickly try and comparison shop a product on Amazon, you get a network error (this happens a lot when you aren't aware there's free WiFi). You either have to load the browser and accept the WiFi hotspot TOS, or shut off WiFi. Kind of annoying- especially since most free hotspots don't remember you when you return a few days later and you need to repeat the process. Not really a problem with the phone specifically. In my opinion if the phone doesn't detect internet access on the WiFi connection, it should automatically switch to the Mobile Data connection. I shouldn't have to force it to switch. It's an unnecessary step. In fairness, this may be by design to assist users using too much data on their data plans. Also, if you're thinking of a case, I find this one to work well. It doesn't bulk out the phone, and includes a secure belt clip: Verizon OEM Shell Belt Clip Holster Combo Case and Kick Stand for VZW Motorola Droid Razr M XT907 RAZRM XT 907 by Verizon And if you're looking for a ridiculously overbuilt, industrial car window mount, try this: RAM Mount Universal X-Grip Holder Twist Lock Suction Cup Mount In all I am very happy with this phone.

1375,B0096QYH80,Lynn Dalton,4,12-Dec-12,False,Motorola Droid RAZR M,"I've had this phone for about 2 weeks & like it so far. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy S that was running Froyo. That phone came with an earlier version of Android but I rooted it to get the later version & get rid of Verizon bloatware including Bing as the default search engine. There are so many cool things to like about this phone & Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). It has a higher resolution screen than my old phone - 540x960 vs 480x800. Even with the higher res, the phone is smaller, about 1/8"" in each dimension. The thickness is the same, but tapers to a bit thinner than the Samsung. The RAZR M has the same resolution & screen size as some other current Moto phones, but with less bezel. I like having a smaller phone. I liked the RAZR MAXX for its battery life & 540x960 res, but it was just too big. The ratio of thickness to height & width made it seem too thin like I'd probably break the screen at a huge expense to replace. Insurance costs upfront or monthly typically has a $100 deductible. Both the RAZR M & MAXX were the same price ($0), so that wasn't a consideration. The weak point of this phone is the camera. The Samsung was 5 megapixels & this one is 8, but the image is not as good as what I was used to. Shadow ares show lots of noise. It has problems doing macro shots where the Samsung focused closely. I considered the Samsung Galaxy S III, but like the RAZR MAXX, the size turned me off. There are some great features of Jelly Bean that really make using the phone better than Froyo. There's a recent apps button that brings up all of your recently opened apps. Chrome also has something similar to tabs on a desktop browser that lets you keep many web pages open & switch among them. The phone came with Ice Cream Sandwich & was updated to Jelly Bean a few days later. This update removed the ability to hook the phone up to a PC via USB (UMS) to add & remove files from the phone's memory. That was a stupid move on the part of Google. Furthermore Motorola tech support didn't even have that issue in their knowledge base & I wasted over 2 hours on the phone & resetting it to factory specs. I've found AirDroid to connect via Wifi & access the files on the phone, but it's not as seamless or fast as just using a USB cable. Shame on you Google. They also removed Speed Dialing. It was halfway there in Ice Cream Sandwich - you could set up speed dials, but they didn't work. So they removed the halfway implemented feature from Jelly Bean. Some Moto (Google now) rep online said they found that speed dials weren't used very much. We've has speed dials since cordless phones with touch tone buttons. There's a workaround widget called Direct Dial, but it's not as elegant.

22599,B07N91S9MW,psychtobe,2,12-Aug-19,True,Great phone if you don’t need it to stay turned on.,"I had the moto g5 and was happy with it for two years. When I cracked the screen I did my research and saw that the G7 remained a good budget phone, and being happy with the G5 I went for it. Big mistake. Soon after I got this phone it began shutting off randomly, without warning. It does this as often as twice a day. I contacted Moto and they blamed an app I had downloaded, and suggested I run the phone in safe mode. Well, that helped the problem but makes the phone unusable. After a lot of trial and error I discovered that any audio product - apps such as Youtube, Pandora, Spotify downloaded on the phone will cause this problem. If I delete all of these products, and don’t use Youtube in the browser, then the phone doesn’t shut down. Well, this is not an ‘app’ problem. This is a phone problem. These are standard, safe apps with millions of users. The phone is not compatible with these apps. That makes the phone a joke. The second problem is the fingerprint reader is very inconsistent. I could live with this if it were the only problem but in my opinion it does not work as well as the g5 reader did. The battery life is also inferior to the G5. The G5 lasted two days with moderate use. The G7 often does not last the full day. Part of this is the next problem: The screen is very dim. In order to see the phone outside, the screen brightness needs to be on close to full brightness. I think this adversely affects battery life. Compared to the G5, the device is faster; the phone function itself has markedly louder volume, a big plus; and supposedly it has NFC which I haven’t tried yet. But none of this matters, because the d*** phone doesn’t stay on. This means, for example, I can’t use the phone as my alarm, because it sometimes just shuts down in the middle of the night. Moto’s lame excuse that this is an app problem is unacceptable.

14658,B072ZWCKP5,Bob Jacobson,1,12-Aug-17,True,UPDATE TO MY PRIOR REVIEWS (below): Consider this before buying this phone as anything other than a stopgap.,"UPDATE: I'm about five months into owning this phone and as of now, NOTHING WORKS RIGHT. Simply transferring apps from the too-small internal memory to an SD card, the usual thing to do, threw everything into chaos. Essentially, the phone is right now unusable. I will have to backup the entire memory and all the apps, then do a factory reset -- basically, emptying the phone -- and hope that it works again, at least for a few more months. Support from Lenovo is zilch. As you can see from my earlier review, I like this phone in concept and for awhile, it worked as promised. But now it doesn't and I'm on my own. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $50 or $100 for a real phone that really works, that has an up-to-date OS (operating system), and that receives regular security updates -- none of which pertains to this phone. Ick. Ick. Ick. * . * . * I expected by now to receive from Lenovo, directly or via VerizonWireless, to receive an Oreo upgrade and an update to its security patch, which dates from July 2017. Neither now seems to be the case. Hence, my phone is about 75% effective and an open target for digital outlaws. (I subscribed to Kasperian to have a fighting chance against them.). Also, the notification LED remains disabled, and since the (pre-Oreo) Nougat Android OS doesn't provide badges on icons as notifications of waiting items, there is no way to check for new messages, email, software, etc. without reading through pages of notifications. Lastly, I had to use a third-party apps, ""drupe,"" to replace the terrible Lenovo dialer. I use my phone well enough, but as soon as I can afford it, I'm buying another with these essential items, especially as Lenovo seems impervious to customer requests that it offer the same upgrades and security as does, for example, Nokia, even on its cheapest phones. In an earlier version of this review, I noted a number of problems with the phone. These I've cured by diddling with settings, installing Android Store apps (like the excellent dialer/contact manager app ""drupe"" and the terrific Blue Mail email client) to replace stock apps, and adding SD memory to barely adequate internal memory. An earlier incompatibility with Kindle has sorted itself out. The battery's great, fast-charging and long-lasting; the screen's big, bright, and indestructible; and the fingerprint ID and mouse is practical and fun to use. All around good design. Lenovo (owner of Motorola) won't upgrade this phone with the new Android OS 8 (Oreo): something to do with not overburdening this phone's cheap chip set. This at first out me off, but then I read that fewer than a quarter of all Android phones -- the most expensive -- come with Android. The largest fraction are running Android OS 7.1.1 (Nougat), including this one, so no big deal. Eventually there will be Oreo knock-offs, but Nougat works just fine. Still, Lenovo: how about a security update? It's a small but important matter. Lenovo support overall could be better, though there's plenty of it online.",19.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

3553,B00HPP3QD6,Brandy Alexander,5,12-Aug-14,False,I love this phone !,"Ok I am a cheap person. I have NEVER had a contract phone ! I have only had prepaid through Verizon wireless. Since i'm cheap and I already own an Ipod and a Kindle HDX I only had their cheapest flip phone models. I will also admit that I was bit scared of having a non flip style phone...I feared butt dialing and embarrassing myself. I feared the battery life would be too short for my needs. I feared it would be too hard to learn to use a smartphone. All my fears were unnecessary!!! I got mine from RadioShack ( my flip phone broke and I needed a phone NOW ) The Moto G is a great phone. The display is big,bright and beautiful! The phone is just the perfect size and weight. I keep my phone in my back pocket,it fits well and does NOT slide out. The battery life is excellent. I use it all day ( I turn data off and keep screen at medium brightness ) for calls, texting maybe a few minutes of web surfing (WIFI) I still have half a battery by late night! The call quality is way better than the cheapO Samsung Gusto2 flip phone that I was previously using! The hardest part for me was adjusting to a non flip style of phone. It took me a day or two to feel totally comfortable. I downloaded an app called call confirm. It launches each time my phone attempts to dial out. Its a great app because it keeps my phone from calling out on its own ( a big fear that I had ) The phone was easy to set up and to learn to use...Perfect for a first time smartphone owner. Overall, I love this phone ! It has met and far exceeded my expectations! Its an incredible value at $ 79.00 ( the price I paid ) *** HERES WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE MOTO G *** * Low price ! * Look great! The size is perfect! The screen is large and bright ! * The screen is very responsive ! * Rings very loud ! * Has great battery life ! * Call Quality is very good ( not great ) * The phone is FAST !",12.0,Motorola,Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only),https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Verizon-Prepaid-Phone-Only/dp/B00HPP3QD6,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VuPb8-arL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00HPP3QD6,773,64.99,0.0

22495,B07N91S9MW,Gregory H.,2,12-Apr-19,False,Updated review (and downgraded rating),"I've had to remove my original review and update it to this one, and unfortunately I cannot recommend the Moto G7 any longer. Shorter after my last review, my phone started having wifi connection issues whereas it drops your wifi on and off throughout the day, causing apps and processes to stall out. At first I thought perhaps I just had a buggy individual unit, so I did the troubleshooting steps I'm familiar with such as rebooting, going in and out of airplane mode, etc. Nothing worked. I even completely reset my phone to mfg settings and redid it. Problem still came back. Turns out there are quite a few Moto forum posts about the G7/G7 Power phones having this exact same issue. It is not just my unit - it affects quite a number of them. The most troubling part was that Moto reps were asking people in these forums to create phone logs and send them in, but this has been going on for months. No updates or fixes and answers no longer being posted in their own forum about it. Not even, ""We are working on a fix, thank you for your patience"", type of thing. Meanwhile, the problem for many continues. For some tasks it's not a huge deal - you can simply switch off wifi and use LTE to do them. But things like video doorbells and some video security camera apps really do need wifi to work effectively (or, at all) - when you cannot connect to home security apps, yeah, that's a problem. Phone calls/texting continue to work as there seems to be no issue with the cell tower connections. Nice screen, decent camera, Soso battery life. But it would be a good value money wise and a good, usable phone. But it's ruined by Moto/Lenovo's lack of addressing this KNOWN issue and their unresponsive attitude so far. So again, I just have to downgrade this to 2 stars and give it a ""not recommended"" rating.",324.0,Motorola,"Moto G7 – Unlocked – 64 GB – Ceramic Black (US Warranty) - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, & Metro",https://www.amazon.com/Moto-G7-Unlocked-Warranty-T-Mobile/dp/B07N91S9MW,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Vobb06FVL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07N91S9MW,361,179.99,299.99

22746,B07NP6R2RG,Amazon Customer,4,11-Sep-19,True,"Amazing price, always responsive, and awesome features","I had a 2 year old Samsung J7 Star before this one. It finally just reached the end of its life due to how much I use and depend on my phone, and very suddenly wouldn't reliably do anything I asked it to. So, I did some digging and found this one, about $100 cheaper than I originally paid for the Samsung. This was a pretty neat upgrade. Some apps use the full screen mode that allows you to fill the boarder at the top of the phone, giving it more surface space. Other apps just stop at the top, but still give you your battery life and the time in that top bar. The lower boundary is oddly shaped, but I use a lot of apps, and everything is always accessible with ease. The speaker gets louder, but it doesn't have as good of quality by the time you turn it all the way up. This leads to the mics breaking or just some basic vibration sounds while you play music, but it gets plenty loud before reaching this point as well. This phone has a neat little set of tricks up its sleeve. The swipes on the home screen and to pull up the bottom menu quickly become habit. I've been using this two weeks, now, and it's been very easy to adjust to. The battery life isn't as good. Instead of plugging it in around 2-3 am when I normally go to bed (I work evenings), I have to plug it in around midnight instead. But it charges quickly, and the battery still lasts a full day. I think a lot of its power goes to the quad processer, but the phone is responsive and never seems to lag for anything, even when running music, IMs, some background web pages, and a game. I've had no issues with it at all. The phone comes with all the things you need to set it up at home. The tray for the SIM and SD card gave me some grief when I tried to put it back in, but I don't need to access that every day, and it finally went back in with a little wiggling. It comes with a small rubber case that I wouldn't trust if my phone took a tumble, but it does stop you from throwing it around like wet soap. The glass backs sure do look nice, but the lack of texture is always an issue. Including a rubber case is an interesting way to remedy that. You can do all the cool tricks of customizing your phone, too. Different lock and home screen pictures, and you can even change the picture in the background of your keyboard. The texting app has ""dark mode"" which is amazing for people like me that struggle with bright screens. This phone is a perfect example of not needing to cough up a couple thousand dollars for a good modle. I absolutely hope that Moto keeps this up.",1.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G7 (64GB, 4GB RAM) Dual SIM 6.2"" 4G LTE (GSM Only) Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1962-4 No Warranty (Clear White)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Smartphone-International-XT1962-4/dp/B07NP6R2RG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c3FZ-X6nL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NP6R2RG,108,153.99,179.99

The phone is supposed to unlock after you use $75 worth of services from Verizon. I bought over $700 worth of services from them, but through a third party company, and because of this they wouldn't unlock the phone. Figuring this out took hours with customer service. If their automated system doesn't understand what you're saying, instead of transferring you to a representative it hangs up on you. So first I had to figure out how to get to an actual person. Then once I did the person I got was completely unhelpful. He told me he could help me buy more Verizon products, but not fix the one I already had. Why would I buy more of something that doesn't work? Hung up and dialed in again and, luckily, got a really great customer service person who did her best, but after investigating every possibility the policies were too strict and there was nothing she could do.

We have had Moto X phones before with good experiences and I expected a next-generation experience from that. The specs are all there, and the phone is attractive enough. Setup and personalization are OK. However, the phone immediately had some issues related to the vendor software: switching to speaker mode during a call worked, but could not be switched back to headset. Very annoying. Volume control during media playback seems to randomly affect ringtone levels instead. Pairing with vehicle systems (2 different manufacturers) is inconsistent and track data is not transmitted (apparently due to the lack of an enhanced AVRCP driver, something the Moto X had 2 years ago). More recently the phone began becoming very hot, seemingly at random but often when the charge level was low. Last week, after less than 3 months of use, it heated up again and the touchscreen stopped responding. After a reboot, the screen seems totally blank. Phone has gone back to Moto for a replacement, we will see how that process goes.

The Razr M has the perfect size to fit in your hand and pocket (not a large bulky frame to take up space) The 4.3"" display hits the sweet spot for form and function. The battery lasts a ridiculously long amount of time as compared to other smart phones. On the Verizon Network you can talk and surf the web simultaneously, something you can't do with the Iphone on Verizon or Sprint. Best of all you have a microSD slot to expand memory on the phone. I purchased a 64GB MicroSDXC SanDisk (category 10)memory card on Amazon, formatted it on my phone, and it works like a charm!! That's more memory than is available for the Iphone.

1304,B0096QYH80,househunter,4,11-Oct-12,False,a review by a non phone aficionado,"I've had my phone now for just under the 15 day cut off period Verizon gives us to switch if we want to, and I've decided to keep the Razr M. My job as a realtor and part time investor has finally forced me to embrace the kind of technology that allows one instant access to information, so I decided this time around to upgrade to a phone that would hopefully let me receive & send emails, look up information on real estate sites, get where I'm going without getting lost, etc., and the Razr M seems more than capable of doing that. There's very little argument that I can see among reviewers regarding the speed of this phone, and I can vouch for that. It opens up applications quickly, and switches apps and screens with almost zero delay. When I receive a notification that I have a new email, I can be at that open gmail message in literally 2 or 3 seconds. The screen on this phone is extremely good as well. I've seen lots of reviews criticizing the pentile display as not being ""true HD"", but I'm quite sure most people wouldn't know that if someone hadn't told them, it just plain looks extremely high definition to me. The battery life is also more than adequate. I was afraid going from a feature phone that I had to recharge maybe twice a week to a smart phone, that I'd be sadly disappointed in the battery life. But I can go two full days on a charge with the Razr- that's looking at maybe 20-30 emails a day, another 30-40 texts, 20 minutes of conversations, a few photos and maybe 15 minutes of web browsing. My 15 year old son has the iphone 4s, and he considers the build quality of the Razr M to be at least as good as his phone, likes the screen size better, and really can't tell much of a difference in screen quality between the two. The camera is another area where professional reviewers have beaten on this phone a bit. I've taken a number of photos with it already, and anything taken in strong to medium light looks absolutely fine. Its low light capabilities are a bit weaker than the iphone 4s but again, coming from a feature phone with a 2.3 MP camera that could barely produce a recognizable image in low light, the Razr M camera is very adequate. All in all, I'm very happy with the Razr M, and I'd give it 5 stars if not for the bloatware issue that Verizon has caused by insisting on putting all kinds of Amazon and other partner apps in a phone that only has 8 gigs of storage internally. I looked at several alternatives before deciding on the M. The Galaxy SIII was just a bit awkward in size, felt a bit cheaper in quality, and the screen wasn't quite as bright. The iphone 5 was an another option, but I really hated the thought of being dependent on itunes, and it didn't even give you the option of increasing its storage with a micro usb card. I thought briefly about the Blackberry Bold touchscreen, and had it been 4g, with a better battery and camera, I might have thought harder, but I guess there's a reason RIM is losing market share as fast as they are.",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Droid RAZR M XT907 Verizon Wireless, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Droid-RAZR-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B0096QYH80,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-afm8RuLL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0096QYH80,488,349.99,0.0

4480,B00MWI4HW0,Man o 'tides,5,11-Nov-14,True,Goodbye dumbphone. Hello incredible smartphone,"I thought myself pretty brilliant and downright smug going down the road of life with a dumbphone with TMobile prepaid minutes in one hand and an Itouch wifi phone (TextMe app) in the other. I would look down my nose at my friends with their fancy smartphones (although I have to admit I was impressed with those gorgeous display screens) and pity those poor souls with their pricey contracts. I mean when ya got down to it I had all I needed for cheap personal communication (less than 10 bucks a month) cell phone (mainly for emergencies as I don't do a great deal of calling and occasional ""where are you"" queries) and wifi phone with very cheap minutes and free texting. 90% of my calls are via wifi anyway. Yeah I had to haul around two devices...my candy bar dumbphone with its 2 inch display and that little ol Itouch (4th gen) the always impressive Swiss army knife of electronicdom. Thus content in my old technology I swore I would never buy a smartphone.....Until...I stumbled upon review and after positive review of the Moto G 2nd Gen. And ...I mean a pure Android experience with very little bloatware, a 5 inch screen, and a guaranteed move up to Lollipop, and an Amazon price tag of ....what??....only 179 bucks? Did I order this thing immediately if not sooner. No. I read user reviews till I was blue in the face....until...at last...convinced...I said to myself.... I'm in. Amazon shipping was fast....the Moto G 2nd Gen arrived sooner than expected. For some reason it didn't come with a sim card. No problem as I took it to the TMobile kiosk at the mall and they installed the sim card (free) with my TMobile minutes in no time and my Moto G 2nd Gen was good to go. Having been used to my dumbphones small screen I was taken aback by the vividly rich colors and sharpness of the 5 inch display on this puppy. The Moto G feels well built and soiid and I can hold it very comfortably. And I can put in my jeans pocket and almost forget it's there. I liked the 8 pixel camera after giving it a good work out and was pretty well pleased with the results. I had read a lot of good things regarding the free Google Camera app so decided to download it. I must say it turned what I would call a very nice camera into an even better one. I found the Google Camera app does better in low light than the stock camera and I really like the features including ""camera blur"". As far as battery life: I have yet to get at least 24 hours with usually about 15% left. This after my routine, surfing, ebook reading, light camera use, email, gaming (Scrabble, Classic Word...not heavy duty gaming) youtube, IHeart and TuneIn radio, wifi calling and texting and vpn use at public wifi hotspots. Mostly I keep screen brightness at or below 50% and use battery saver. I could go on and on about this smartphone but all I can say is that I like it very much and am glad I now continue with the my less than 10 bucks a month personal commuicatioon using TMobile prepaid minutes and wifi phone (Text Me app) in one, user friendly , efficient and sexy device with all the bells and whistles I need and then some at a bargain of a price. The $179 Moto G 2nd gen is one heck of a deal. One other thing: don't waste your money on screen protectors. The Moto G 2nd gen comes with gorilla glass which takes an awful lot of effort to scratch. Check out the gorilla glass tests on youtube. UPDATE: 5/11/15 After several months as an owner of this phone I am quite pleased. Also didn't realize just how much I enjoy listening to the FM radio app that is included with the phone.

1365,B0096QYH80,Selina,4,11-May-14,False,Decent Introductory Android Smartphone,"I bought this phone on contract at Cartoys when it first came out in September of 2012. Let me start off by stating what type of user I was: A teenager, looking for a decent smartphone, sub $100. I had no expectations since this would be my first smartphone. I was looking for a compact phone that could fit into my pocket. I was also looking for a device that could be my camera, music player, and be able to run the games I want to play. This phone is similar in size with the iPhone 5 and it currently runs with 4.1.2 Jellybean (the current version of software, 4.4 Kitkat is supposedly being released in a ""few weeks""). Pros: -Colorful display, very bright when turned on the highest setting -8 MP Camera on the back, which is a good camera for normal lighting, but it doesn't do well in low lighting. -Runs Android 4.1.2 and may receive an update to 4.4 Kitkat in the future -NFC functional (phone transfers/receives data by touching with another phone; Used it to check the balance on my bus card) -loud alarm clock -People ask if it's an iPhone so... Thank you Apple for setting the standard. -Chromecast Remote, but that seems more Chromecast than this phone... -Durable with case: case has dings and no broken screen Okay, but could be better: -Games: it works, but once in a while (if you're playing Riptide GT 2) it may just not respond, so just press ""Okay"" and keep playing. -Rear Speaker can be accidentally muffled by my fingers, but it is loud. -4G LTE may not be found in certain areas, but normally high school tries to lessen your signal and mountain overpasses probably are meant to be remote for a reason. -Call quality could be better on speaker phone Cons: -Lag. Not many people want to perform factory resets, although it's easier if your life does not revolve around your phone. Lag can also be remedied by changing the animation, window, and transition scale to none (although to the psychologically, none may seem like the phone is lagging even more) or to 0.5 under developer options in the Settings. Do not get a task killer app; it just closes processes that the phone will reopen and it's a vicious cycle. -Battery: It's decent, can keep maybe a day and some if you're a light user, but for heavier users with consistent screen on time, then it could last from 4-6 hours depending on if you have Wi-Fi or LTE on. Battery does get really warm with constant usage. - Pre-installed apps: If you don't use them, disable them or ""Force Stop"". I did this with the NFL, IMDB, Google Magazine, and Slacker radio. While it sucks to have apps that are some users don't need, the only way to remove the apps that I know of is to root the phone. Overall this phone is decent for a starter. It does the tasks that you want it to do and even becomes an integral part of your life if you choose. If Motorola holds up on its promise to bring 4.4 Kitkat to the phone, it may possibly change the lag situation. If you choose to buy this phone, then buy a case (even if it is thin rubbery plastic) to avoid dings if you drop it on concrete. After I update, this phone will still be a good music player, camera, alarm clock, games, ebook reader ,and a device that a kid could use for a long road trip. UPDATE: 4.4.2 KitKat was released and the battery life is better. When you turn on your mobile data (4G LTE) it connects faster than it did before.

5392,B00TFAVFL4,Daniel,5,11-Mar-15,True,Yay 2nd Generation.,"Is a really nice update for the old Motorola Moto E. Nowdays on $95 used to be $130 & used to be the best phone you could get for less than $130. Now with this release of Moto E 2nd Generation you can be sure it is the best phone you could get for $120 & If you need/like LTE for $150 you could get Moto E2 version with LTE (But 4GB capacity instead of 8GB). Trust me, you wont regret getting this ""cheap"" phone. Improvements from Moto E to Moto E 2nd Gen: * New Android (From v4.4 Kitkat to v5.0 Lollipop) * More cores (From Dual to Quad) * Front Camera (Added) * Capacity (From 4GB to 8GB) * Bigger Battery (From 1980 mAH to 2390 mAH) * Larger Screen (From 4.3'' to 4.5'') Cons: * No Flash. * Only 5MB camera. * Phone & Wall Charger only, No HeadPhones nor USB cable. * Low Capacity.. Even Improved to 8GB isn't big enough (for me, since you can use ONLY like 5GB)... - I think it should be minimum 16gb.. of course you can use a microSD, but some apps wont allow you to move to the SD card & thats a problem sometimes if you've too much apps. At the end is an amazing phone, considering is only 120$ we get so much. UPDATE: After using it for almost a year everything is working fine. So if you bought one and have any kind of problems using it (sound, screen, anything) just return it and ask for a new one. Nowdays (December 2015) it only cost 90$ & 100$ with LTE (I bought at 120$ without LTE). So a pretty good option for people that need or want a smartphone with good capacities without spending too much money.. The biggest problem with this phone (besides camera <good but not great> of course better camera would increase price a lot) is the capacity <only 8GB>, with the software updates and having too many apps you'll have some capacity problems.",163.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto E (2nd Generation) Locked Cellphone, Black",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Locked-Cellphone/dp/B00TFAVFL4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T5JR5djdL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00TFAVFL4,1,0.0,0.0

3994,B00K0NS0P4,Marcus R,5,11-Jun-14,True,Everything you ever wanted or needed in a phone,"So first I should point out that I am a fan and recent convert to cheap unlocked cellphones. I have done the 2-year subsidized phones in the past and made the switch to off-contract unlocked phones after years of paying way too much for phone service, that when you leave the country just seem stupid. Now obviously you my first thoughts when abandoning a major carrier for something like Straight Talk or Cricket were things like number portability, network reliability, and data especially the sweet sweet 4G stuff. So I did my research and thanks to things like Google Voice and BYOP on Straight Talk I would be keeping my number; using the same networks for super low rates; and heck they even throw in 3GBs of LTE data. Now to the device at hand. The Moto G LTE, wow this little guy kick ass. Android KitKat installed with a guaranteed upgrade to the next Android flavor. Excellent build quality, with Gorilla Glass, LTE model comes with SD card slot as well. Uses MicroSIM card it says not to use a SIM card adapter, but I did from a nano. When compared to other phones that a similarly priced, there are none that can come close to the specs we are talking about here. LTE is a BIG deal, one of the biggest things keeping me in the higher priced phones like the Nexus 5, One+ One, and Blu. Obviously there are a couple of things that this phone does not have one being wireless charging like my Palm Pre had several years ago (come on people,) you'll need to go with the Nexus 5 for that. The other feature I would have liked to have seen is NFC though this feature I have less concern about as the market is trying to figure out what to do with it. PROs: Holds its own with when compared with the flagships in terms of usability and overall build quality.

5280,B00OZTSY6Y,Donald Sensing,4,11-Jul-15,False,Great - except for the FIVE HOUR Android update,"I bought this to replace my Samsung GS 4. I had had the Droid RAZR before and really liked it, and didn't fall for the GS4 all that much. There is no perfect phone and the Turbo isn't it, either. That said, I am not pining for my GS4. I love the Turbo's screen and long battery life. Haven't gotten 48 hours from the battery as advertised, but I haven't tried, either. I know the power lasts a whole longer than it did on the Samsung, which sucked the battery dry in well under a day. The Droid's ""turbo"" charger works as advertised and will really pump up battery charge in a short time. It is, btw, just a 15-watt charger so any other 15W charger will do the same. I have read that all smartphones will move to this. About the upgrade to Lollipop 5.1: My phone came with v. 4.4.4 and the upgrade directly to 5.1 was released about a week ago. It did not go well for mine. The screen advised it would take 20 minutes. I had upgraded the Samsung to 5.0 so I thought I knew what to expect. Once the upgrade started I plugged in the charger and walked away. TWO HOURS later all the phone was doing was to cycle through boot, then ""installing update,"" then to the dead phone symbol of the little Android robot lying on its back. Over and over. I called Verizon tech support, who called Motorola, who said they had never encountered that before. Verizon is overnighting me a replacement Turbo as I type, but since the happened Friday night, overnight means I'll get it Tuesday. The phone would not factory reset, either, nor would it turn off. So I figured the battery would run down overnight and I left it on my desk when I went to watch the ball game on TV. Three hours later I came back and -- the phone was fully updated and fully functional with no data or apps lost. It actually conserves battery power even better than before. I have no idea what the problem was, but the update was successful after all, it just took five hours instead of 20 minutes.

3321,B00HPP3QD6,K. Zinth,5,11-Jul-14,True,Probably Won't Impress Your Friends (But So What?),"I came to this phone from an iPhone 5 (Verizon) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 (Virgin Mobile). Both of those phones were in themselves superior to this phone in just about every way, although battery life and voice quality on the Moto G is clearly superior to the Samsung. The deciding factor for me was that the price of the prepaid was far less on Verizon's network, which I found negates any advantage of the superior hardware on the Virgin network. If you're in love with Apple's OS, can pay the premium, and want a higher quality camera, stick with the iPhone. While I love Mac otherwise, I prefer the Android experience, so this made sense for me. To each his own. Bang for buck wise, I think this blows any offering on Virgin out of the water, due to the the network's limitations. Voice quality has been great, camera is passable, size is good, display is pretty good, network/GPS connectivity has been pretty darnn good. All in all, I give this five stars because this phone is good to really good but not great in so many areas, but paired with the network and the price, it is a perfect fit for this non-power user who still demands what may now be considered basic levels of smart phone performance.

1389,B0096QYH80,T. Winston,3,11-Jul-14,False,good phone,"I had a Samsung Galaxy III and loved it. It was such a beautiful phone. I hated that I had to replace it eventually due to horrible battery life. It got to the point where I could barely use the phone. For some strange reason the battery drained constantly everyday all day. It was like I had no phone at all and it constantly shut down. I felt that I needed to get another phone and decided to purchase the Motorola Razr M. I purchased it through Verizon web page. When I got it through the mail I was quite surprised at how small this phone was. I was so used to my wide screen Samsung Galaxy III. I was kind of disappointed. It felt like I downgraded from the Samsung Galaxy III. I really wanted a phone the same size as the galaxy with decent battery life. The motorola is quite compact and very light but it is a decent phone. One positive is that the graphics and screen on this phone is very beautiful. In my honest opinion even better than the Galaxy III that I had. The graphics and color are very sharp and clear which I love. My mother has a phone with remarkable color and graphics to. Way better than the Galaxy or Iphone combined. Just a very stunning and beautiful screen which is a plus. Even though I will miss my Galaxy, the Motorola that I have functions just like it and has the same features just more compact. I guess by most smartphones operating on droid they have similar functions. Far as battery life I am sure this phone will do quite well. My Samsung was horrible and a friend of mine that had the same phone had that issue as well. The Samsung was so bad I don't think this phone can be any worse. You just cannot enjoy a phone with an atrocious battery life. This phone may not be aesthetically pleasing but I can tell it is a decent phone. Touch sceen works great. The keyboard is excellent to type on and responds quickly. Making calls or receiving calls is decent also and the reception is good. I definately recommend this phone to anyone looking for a nice compact smart phone. This phone performs good and quite functional. It is good to know that their are other devices just as good as the Samsung or Iphone.

Then, my carrier discovered that it was blacklisted/carrier blocked. That's usually reserved for stolen/lost phones, and is usually reversible. However, several hours later, and I had to settle for a refund thanks to their mistake. Rather than actually check to see if their used phone would or could work, Amazon sold what could have been stolen merchandise that would not work on any carrier in the US, and not only hid that information from me, but couldn't even help me fix the problem. Amazon touted this as an unlocked, ready to be use phone. They lied. In short, Amazon pulled one of the oldest scamming tricks in the book. I'd expect this of a shady reseller on Ebay, not of my beloved retail giant. They also, contrary to the manufacturers, and my carriers information, couldn't unlock it, and couldn't/wouldn't tell me any of the history of the used phone to give me the information required to unblock it.

9789,B01LEL8ABY,Amazon Customer,3,11-Jan-17,True,Beware: This phone does NOT receive updates,"As of writing, it is January 11, 2017. The unlocked Lenovo Moto Z was released back in September here in the United States. And also as of writing, this phone has never received an update since it was released. None. It is still on Android 6.0.1, and still on the July 2016 security patch. Not only does this make the phone horribly insecure in regards to malware and other exploits, it has not received the Android 7.0 update. Bizzarely, Motorola/Lenovo has advertised that the phone has the Android 7.0 update since November, but it only takes a little Googling to find that the US unlocked model in particular, has received no updates in the 4 months since its release, and both Motorola and Lenovo support will give no time frame for when or if it might receive any. This is despite the fact that the Verizon ""Droid"" model has enjoyed fairly frequent updates and has had Android 7.0 for months. The India, China, Europe, and Canada models also have been updated for a while now. But the unlocked US version? Absolutely nothing. It's a shame too, because the phone is nice. Good screen, nice build, fast performance, insanely thin, and 64GB + microSD is a great for those who like to download lots of apps, games, and movies. But Lenovo has completely and utterly ignored this phone in regards to support. There are many far better options out there for even cheaper prices. UPDATE: Well as of February 10, 2017, the phone has officially been updated to Android 7.0. Great, right? Well, not entirely. While I am happy to have Nougat, the unlocked Moto Z received an old version of the update, complete with a 3 month old security patch (Nov 2016) and without any of the bug improvements that the Droid models received. For example, in Android 7.0 there is a bug that lowers the volume of your notifications, making it difficult to hear. The Droid models received an update fixing that in late January, and have received a security patch update since then as well. The unlocked Moto Z, despite being updated later than that, received an older, less secure, bugged update. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we at least got Nougat. But my previous point still stands.

For the thin profile, the battery gives me a full day's use without needing to recharge. I am sure this may change over time, but I had also heard that Android Nougat (7.0) was supposed to improve battery performance. Not confident I will find out anytime soon if that is true. As you may have read from other reviews, this unlocked version on AT&T has been largely ignored by Lenovo / Moto and possibly AT&T. This is not a phone that AT&T carries, so I can't really fault them as much, but I would have certainly expected Lenovo to have upgraded the unlocked Moto Z by now. The Verizon version was upgraded OTA around November last year. The notification problem has lead to me missing a couple of things, but in general it's not a showstopper. I have seen far worse issues on Google Pixel and iPhone 7. Overall, this is a very good phone all things considered, but I would definitely like to get the improvements that come with the Nougat update.

14558,B072ZWCKP5,Ava shopper,5,11-Dec-17,True,"Best phone for the specs, price, and battery for young students.","The following is a review from my 12 yr old kid. ----------------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW- This phone is a great phone for those who need a big battery, cheap price, and decent speed. When I am listing the pros and cons, keep in mind that I use this phone for school, and limited usage- only calls and occasional web browsing and music playing, no games or videos. PROS- -The battery is first. With 5,000 mAh, this will easily last you two days on average usage. For me, I only need to charge it once a week. For the price, this is an excellent battery, and most people will buy it just for that. It is technically embedded, however, it is just held in with screws, so if you really needed to, you could remove it. There is a warning label which does say, ""DO NOT REMOVE"". -Next is the display. Even though the resolution is 720p, you really can't tell the difference between it and 1080p, and remember, if the screen was 1080p, you'd be paying a lot more for this phone. Besides, 720p is still considered HD quality, so you've got nothing to worry about. For me, I get perfectly vibrant and visible colors when using this for watching the occasional Youtube, and everything else is clear as well. -The stock system is next. With this phone running Nougat right out of the box, you've got about 2-3 outside apps than what vanilla Nougat gives you, and they're mostly Motorola apps. For many people, their phones come with many bloatware apps and that takes up space for your other apps you install. -Then we have its speed. With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 427, it provides a decent speed at which it handles its processes. You can do many functions at once without it slowing down, and it responds just as fast as any phone. It can handle light gaming such as Temple Run and Subway Surfers, but it might stutter or slowdown on heavy games like Asphalt 8: Airborne. However, for everyday usage, it will respond and handle very quickly. -Finally, we have its build. The rear is plastic, but feels like metal, and feels smooth and rich. It feels like a higher-end phone, and I like that Motorola put the effort to do that. CONS- -The camera is not amazing. Its pictures are a bit fuzzy on the rear camera, but the front takes decent pictures. Don't expect too much, though, as this camera is cheap in quality, but also cheap in price. You definitely get what you pay for with this camera. -Weight and size are a bit big. At 11.2 oz., this phone is a bit hefty for some, but as you use it, you will definitely get used to it. Also at 5.5 inches display size, it's not a phone which you can very easily pocket or carry. Motorola does provide a ""shrink screen"" option, but it can be a bit of a burden for some. -Base storage is too small. 16 GB is taken up by 9GB of system storage, and after updates and setup, you'll have about 6GB left in storage, which isn't much for other apps. You really do have to take the 32GB version to make the most of it. Personally, I have had this phone for many weeks now and this phone perfectly suits my needs as a student, for limited calling, web browsing, and music. It can handle much more than what I use it for and is one of the best phones in its price range. If you want a great battery, decent speed, good display, and feels like a high-end build, then this is the perfect phone for you.",40.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

7172,B0192XJ0P6,Grant,5,11-Dec-16,True,It came in amazing shape. It's a brand new phone,"Honestly. I don't know HOW THESE AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE. The Turbo 2 has the same performance as my old Galaxy 6. For who ever designed the new Galaxies they should be fired. Honestly. Droid obviously chose practicality over feel. The Samsung covered their phone in Glass. And what is the first thing that breaks on a phone? the Glass. So the Droid Turbo 2 is for the normal human that doesn't have to cover the phone in expensive cases. The droid turbo is fast. Well designed. And a proper phone. I've had galaxies, I've owned an iPhone. And I owned the old Turbo. Motorola all the way because they aren't made to break and aren't a silly fashion statement. The reviewers that give this phone criticism about how it looks should go outside and see how it fairs in normal conditions of day to day use. The droid turbo 2 is only proper phone that I have owned that has earned its dollar. If you want a phone that works, isn't covered in thin glass. Then buy it. If you want a fashion statement. Go buy something else. I've owned the Casio Commando. They have the similar thought but never had the performance. This cuts it close. IF you want it waterproof. Grab a life proof case. I would buy this 10 times over any new galaxy or iPhone. I bought it used. It came in amazing shape. It's a brand new phone. I can't tell the difference. Pros: Not made of glass, made to survive the day to day. Great performance. Battery superb. Amazing Price over the Samsungs or Apple Phones. Properly made.

1366,B0096QYH80,Vinod Shah,5,11-Dec-12,False,Great mid-range phone,"I upgraded from Motorola Droid so it is a big leap for me. I like this phone for many different reasons but mainly for size and unadulterated Android experience. Phone is easy to handle considering it has 4.3"" screen; feels light in shirt pocket. I upgraded to Jelly Bean and Motorola has not messed around with core Android too much. Compared to Samsung Galaxy 3, you would notice how beautiful the fonts, color schemes, menu layout and transitions look. Difference to a keen eye is huge. For example, the settings menu is easier to access than on S3 even though they both have Jelly Bean. Another plus is how few default apps have been thrown in by Verizon compared to TMobile. In fact, Motorola's Smart Actions saves you time and embarrassment. You can configure it to go silent at work, turn on GPS automatically when driving and have it announce caller's name when at home! Also, did you know that this phone has same processor as S3?!! All the apps start quickly, page movements are fluid and videos play loud and clear. Phone looks sexy from all angles. Call quality is acceptable, nothing wrong with it. Battery life is acceptable as well, I am a fairly heavy user of data services through the day and it lasts till night on single charge. Photo quality is 7 out of 10, I felt S3 reproduced slightly more accurate colors. Transferring content to other phones using NFC was a thrill. Overall the phone is pleasure to use, Jelly Bean is what makes the whole experience fun.

Went to a Moto X Play, then a G5 Plus and recently decided to give myself a bit of a birthday present and move up one step to the G6 Plus. They were all dual sim models, since I travel internationally and don’t want to carry multiple phones when impractical. I bought this G6+ 64GB RAM version along with a hard rubber case and a few screen protectors, same way I’ve outfitted my previous phones for carrying in my front pants pocket. It’s a touch bigger than my previous phone, but not obtrusive – doesn’t bump into countertops and doesn’t crowd my junk. Screen size is great, I can view anything with ease. I am primarily on 100% screen brightness most of the daytime since my vision ain’t what it used to be - but that’s a fault of human aging, not the phone. I’ve had to crank up the brightness on iPhones, Samsungs and Nokias alike. Screen resolution is clear, pixel density is high, though I didn’t count them myself. I’ve been reading about notches on screens and how camps are divided one way or another. I could give a sh…oot. If I’m watching a video or reading a webpage, my eyes are never drawn to some notch (or lack thereof) at the end of the screen anyway. As for performance: Phone boots quickly. Apps load speedily and transition between each other with ease. Battery lasts me a day despite moderate to heavy on-time and my screen brightness preference. I transplanted a 64GB microSD card from my G5 and have plenty of storage - though if I run low, this thing’ll support a 256GB card. And yes – there are dedicated slots for the microSD and both active SIMs – none of this “hybrid” second slot crap. The phone functions as a phone. I checked the bands on this unit before buying. It works well with AT&T and foreign carriers alike. Calls are clear, signal is strong. No one has complained about call quality from my end, I hear everyone else just fine. Not sure what else you need. Speakerphone could be a little louder - but if it was and I used it more often, I’d then become one of those obnoxious people I make fun of anyway. If you can’t work with what this phone’s loudspeaker can do, earbuds with a mic are made for that purpose as well. Music and video both play well. Volume on audio (when run through the Dolby feature) are clear and to me, are plenty loud. No, I’m not running Yanni through here. “Thunderstruck” resonates cleanly – though if you're expecting butt-thumpin’ bass lines from any phone speaker, you were poised for disappointment long ago. Pics taken with the phone are more than adequate. better outdoors than in, but that's true of any phone camera. Not sure why the current emphasis is on having a phone camera that’ll potentially outshoot a digital SLR. If you go to a movie opening, the paparazzi aren’t following celebs with their phones, are they? Quentin Tarantino didn’t shoot his latest masterpiece while waving around an iPhone, though that’d be something comical he might be able to pull off. Somehow I now find myself needing a GIF of Samuel L. Jackson looking into a phone camera and declaring “I don’t remember asking you a g*****n thing!” Selfie camera is better than it needs to be, given the subject matter that looks back at me when I point this thing at myself. It’s got a flash, it works, its accuracy and clarity makes me feel as old as my birthday declares. Wifi hooks up to the weak-ass signal at my apartment and locks in better than my laptop. YouTube videos stream without stuttering whether on wifi or AT&T LTE, although those freaking ads… Geez. Both Netflix and Amazon Prime video likewise stream without stutter or buffering. (watch “The Boys” – gratuitous plug here for a very watchable show) Why’d I buy this particular model? I’ve had very good luck with both previous Moto phones I’ve owned. Both are still functional, I just felt like a change – but I’ve never been one who has to have the latest and greatest model of anything. Still, it’s nice to be the first one to tap the buttons, if you know what I mean. Combined with previous brand history, pricing was a significant factor. Between the phone, the case, the screen protectors and the microSD card, I’m all in at about $250. And the G6+ still has a headphone jack. To get similar features from an iPhone, I’d be at 3-4 times that amount for a phone with no dual sim capability, no expansion capability, no headphone jack and no one to come pat me on the shoulder while reassuring me I made a good financial decision by forking over that extra money. Make no mistake – Apple makes one hell of a quality product. So does Lamborghini, but I’m not buying an Huracan for $200K when the Corvette C8 starts around $60K. As for the transaction: Prime eligible. Ordered one day, showed up the next. And mine has English all the way through after setting up the language option at initial boot. All in all, I’m very pleased. One question for anyone else who has this unit (or this irritant): The G6+ automatically upgraded to Android 9 upon startup. After doing so: when I take a screenshot, it brings up a preview screen that requires me to either save, discard or edit the screenshot before proceeding. I’d sure like to lose that requirement and have all screenshots be saved automatically…",2.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G6 Plus - 64GB - 5.9"" FHD+, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model XT1926-7 (Deep Indigo)",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Plus-Smartphone-International/dp/B07CHWMYHP,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511i4Qx+e2L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CHWMYHP,185,174.94,184.99

1353,B0096QYH80,Dev2r,5,10-Oct-12,False,An underdog but a clear winner,"I upgraded from a Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S) to the Droid Razr M after looking at all possible carriers options in the market. The reasons I chose Verizon over AT&T (my previous carrier) * Better signal coverage in my area * New 4G LTE Verizon phones are Global, meaning they can be unlocked and used in other countries using a SIM card. The reasons I chose the Droid Razr M over other phones: * 1.5 GHz Dual processor: Not many phones in the sub-4.5-inch class have a fast or dual processor * 4.3"" screen size: To be fair, I got this phone hoping to push it to my wife once the 4.7"" inch Droid RAZR HD comes along. After having used this phone with a Commuter Ottercase, I feel that a 4.7-incher may be too bulky and hard to use with one hand. I may be keeping this one, missus! * Android ICS - Not tied to iTunes or an Apple ecosystem. Much prefer Google's tie-in services since I've been drinking the Google kool-aid for a while. Now, the thing that has impressed me the most despite my initial reservations - the battery. I was concerned about the non-removable battery since I had to do several battery pulls on my old Samsung when the software stalled. So far (2 weeks), my Android ICS experience has been error-free. The battery life has been AMAZING. I have full 4G data on and Wi-fi enabled for home in the evening, and I'm only at 70% by 10pm! On my old Samsung, I would be at 25%. Other pluses: A decent camera (coming from a DSLR user), Smart actions, Bubble Widget. Pros: * Astounding Battery life * Fast and smooth interface - but a bit confusing, coming from Froyo. More on that below. I personally like that ICS is more consistent when it comes to user-experience between mail and other apps * Mail Notification LED - I love this feature, being a past blackberry user * Great GPS, WiFi and voice call quality Cons: * Heat - When I had GPS, 4G and charging all together, the phone got toasty * Vibrate and Ringtones - Even though the Razr M has some futuristic ringtones, it does not have some standard ones that can be used. Vibrate action seems to be less vibratey * Interface - The ICS interface is radically different from Froyo. My wife had difficulty navigating the new Google Maps whereas she was fairly comfortable with the previous version on Froyo. This is not a phone for total smartphone novices. This phone could be a good-guy doppelganger for the iPhone 5 - similar dimensions, but start using it and you're bound to notice its droidy cyborg vibe.

22804,B07NPRQYP1,Wight,4,10-Jun-19,True,*Amazing* phone,"I don't do $1000 phones. It's just a phone. That said? This is more than just-a-phone. I went from a 3-4 year old Moto E (2nd generation) to this, and was pretty much stunned. So many more features. Quality's gotten *nice* over the years. And it's not quite as seamless as the Apple stuff, I still hate Android even more than I hate Apple, but if you're going to put up with one of them? This is nice, cheap, functional-as-hell, *the battery life is RIDICULOUS*. Minor use, I lose maybe 10% of the battery in a day, heavy gaming and fine, I can drain it much faster. But if I don't have a fetish for some new game this thing'll stay charged for about a week. And I'd never fiddled with TurboCharging before -- discovered I could take a long shower (about an hour, smidge over, I have psoriasis and use a bunch of different shampoos/try to exfoliate/nevermind) -- suffice my plug-slots are all used up in my room, charge in the bathroom during a shower and I've gone from 28% to 93% in about an hour and fifteen minutes. I *do* have some complaints about the phone, mostly that it's not really set up to have everything work all that seemlessly -- example, I can do a double twist ""wave"" gesture with the phone to turn the camera on (if that's enabled), I can press the power button twice to do the same (if that's enabled), but either of those result in me opening the camera *before* unlocking the phone. So someone can fill up my drive with pictures *but* can't turn off the camera to save the battery? The pre-unlock screen gives me, bottom center, the option to ""manually lock"" the phone, requiring the pin -- but the cop can just force my finger onto the reader and that works too. If you enable ""lockdown"" holding the power button will give you a lockdown option which works how the ""manual lock"" should, blocking even the fingerprint reader. Why this difference, I'm not sure. Different designers/nobody chatting enough. Bottom line, the phone *does* have some failings -- but it's an *amazing* phone all the same, I'm proud to have mine. I would recommend this to anyone -- got a few friends not happy with their phones, tempted to get them this... Please note this is a LATIN AMERICAN model, the XT1955-2, and that ""G7 Power"" is *NOT ENOUGH* to determine if a case will fit, etc... If you're shopping for accessories, and don't we all, please make sure they work with the XT1955-2. I got a great case (despite issues about the fingerprint reader being covered, it wasn't), tempered glass screen covers, etc, all at about $8 each. XT1955-2 stuff *is* a lil' harder to find in America -- but it's out there. Also note, this being a LATIN AMERICAN phone, it uses different bands. Look up ""XT1955-2"" -- I found a nice lil' page listing all the bands -- and then I looked over carriers/discovered what seemed likely to work. FreeUp's on AT&T, AT&T uses bands this phone supports (tho they don't match 100%), thus far (with FreeUp) I've had *zero* issues using this phone for calls, texts, whatever I've tried using it for. Note also I love computing, I hate weenies addicted to phones being social by sitting together ignoring each other to tap messages with their thumbs -- I go home to a real machine for a chat fix. So the first thing I did was turn my data plan *off*. I get 200 MB per month for my $10/month subscription, I'll save that until I need it. Which'll probably be never. So sorry, but data's ""untested""... Great phone. I'm sure $1000 phones probably do just a lil' bit more -- but is it worth *that much more* for a lil'-bit-more? I'm loving the $200 phone. $320 counting case, screen protectors, and a $100 512 GB MicroSD card. But then it's a phone that makes my iPhone-using chums drool, battery life beyond compare and *so many movies to watch*, etc... Be careful about fraudulent MicroSD cards. That bit me, buy the cheapest and they're all fake. Get a real one? You have half a terrabyte on your phone. That's just a *ridiculous* amount of movies, tv shows, whatever, you shouldn't need a data plan...",4.0,Motorola,Moto G7 Power - Unlocked - 64 GB - Marine Blue (No Warranty) - International Model (GSM Only),https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Smartphone-International-Model/dp/B07NPRQYP1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nplhIIYjL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NPRQYP1,455,165.0,299.99
24504,B07QP7WZ1T,MiamiOne,5,10-Jun-19,True,Nice upgrade to the Moto g 5 and 6.,"We have both the Moto g5s and the Moto g6. However, I specifically wanted this Moto G7 power, because of the larger battery. The other phones end up on the charger every night. That does not happen with this one, because it has only been on the house charger once. Connecting it to the Samsung adaptive charger in my car, seems to top it off within 30 minutes. When I put the cricket SIM card into it from my Moto g5, it only took about 10 minutes for the phone to connect to the network. also with two SIM card slots, I can add another sim card when I go traveling internationally. A $120 bill that I received once for an 8 minute phone call from another country, definitely makes you want your own international SIM card. There are only two flaws I have seen. 1. This phone will only work with a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi, not the 5.0 GHz version. Not an issue for anyone that has a dual band router. In fact, since it is the only device running on my 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi, it's getting faster downloads then the multiple devices sharing the 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi. 2. The screen on this phone is not as bright at the median setting as compared to the Moto g5 and the Moto G6, that we have. But that doesn't bother me either. Last of all, I have downloaded the same apps on this phone simultaneously while downloading them on the Moto g5 and G6. It not only downloads faster it installs them twice the fast. .",6.0,Motorola,Motorola Moto G7 Power 32GB+4GB RAM XT1955-2 LTE Factory Unlocked GSM 5000mAh Battery Smartphone (International Version) (Marine Blue),https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1955-2-Unlocked-Smartphone-International/dp/B07QP7WZ1T,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KbWOVZW0L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.3,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07QP7WZ1T,84,175.0,0.0

Build quality ,while not better than the all metal One M8, is great and does not feel like a cheap device. And while I liked HTC Sense and what it had to offer nothing beats pure Android with no skin and very minimal bloatware that's not taking up a lot of memory. The Moto X is just as fast and smooth as the One M8 if not better. The only issue is dark/low light photos with the camera. Reviews of the One M8 always bash the camera but HTC's 4 ultrapixel camera is better than the 13 megapixel one on the Moto X. It doesn't handle dark/low light photos well at all and the focus is slower compared to the One M8. While it's pretty much stock Android Motorola did add just a few features of their own that actually WORK! They're not useless features or gimmicks like on Samsung phones.

3996,B00K0NS0P4,M. S. Prager,4,10-Jan-15,True,Very happy with this smartphone,"I bought the unlocked Moto G Universal 4G unlocked LTE smartphone on Amazon to use with Consumer Cellular, a highly recommended reseller of ATT wireless service at incredible prices for low usage folks like me. Consumer Cellular supplied the free SIM card and installation instructions which was made it easy. After doing a lot of reading, I understood the phone very well so I was aware of the phone's shortcomings as well as its value-for-the-money advantages. The most obvious shortcoming like others have noted is the camera. Its OK for the occasional photo but it doesn't compare to an iPhone. If you want incredibly sharp pictures, this isn't the phone for you. The camera has lots of features and is very easy to use. It is important to note that the free QR app I'm using has no trouble at all using the camera to read QR and bar codes off packages in stores. If the camera produced sharper pictures I would have rated the phone with 5 stars. For me, the battery lasts through a full day of mixed usage for me, contrary to what a few others have reported. Since the phone does not come with a charger, that low output repurposed USB charger you used 5 years ago could result in long recharge time possibly leading to the perception of short battery life. So simple for Motorola to include an appropriate charger for this phone! On the plus side, the phone operates smoothly and has excellent sensitivity when using Wifi. The bars show my 4G service is weak in my area but I haven't experienced a dropped call in several weeks of usage. The Android KitKat OS works fine and maybe a little more intuitive than the iPhone OS8 that my wife uses. The syncing with my Google account (mail, calendar, contacts) was totally transparent to me. The speech recognition is excellent for searching Google or getting directions on Google Maps. As a phone, the talk and listen quality are excellent. If I may, I'd like to criticize Motorola/Lenova for their confusing model designations! Moto G, Moto G 4G, Moto X, Moto EXT, first generation, second generation, etc, etc. It made my head explode to ascertain what they were selling and what I was buying. For the record, the verbatim designation on the box this came in is: Motorola XT1045 (Moto G) LTE. Really!

26397,B07WSJYDXX,Stephen the Ex Monk,4,10-Feb-19,True,Decent for the money,"My prior phone was a Nexus 5X when it died suddenly, I wasn't ready to buy a new Pixel for almost $800 so needless to say I wanted something more budget friendly. I landed on the Moto G6. For under $250, you get a current phone that has 64GB of internal storage and can be expanded. So far, battery life may be on the short side but I haven't had it long enough to really say for certain. It responds quickly and I had no trouble moving my SIM card from my old phone to this one. No effort to get it connected, just turned it on and Verizon recognized it. You'll spend a bit of time getting updates installed, this one was at least 4 OTA updates behind, but as of now it has the Nov 2018 security update. Running Android 8 means that most settings and stuff were easy to import from the old device backup on Google's servers. As a non-carrier phone, you get none of the carrier bloat to deal with. Only minimal from Moto. For me, this is a huge positive. I do tend to prefer plain ROM images and so gravitate to using non-oem variants (which is why I ran a Nexus). Compared to the ROM I had been using (both Oreo based), prefer the other even though it had some quirks. My issue largely has to do with the control panel and what options are there as well as it being split into two pages. I think there are some other differences, but since the Nexus is dead (boot loop), i cannot do a side by side comparison. I may eventually unlock the bootloader and load a custom ROM, but for now I'm okay with sticking with the OEM. in part because my preferred ROM isn't available for this phone and also because the flaws I've found with this one aren't enough to justify voiding the warranty just yet.",2.0,Motorola,Motorola G6 – 32 GB – Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) – Deep Indigo - (U.S. Warranty) - PAAE0011US,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-G6-Unlocked-T-Mobile-PAAE0011US/dp/B07WSJYDXX,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L6DbMbvKL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WSJYDXX,836,119.99,249.99

10969,B01MDMJGYT,NewEnglander,4,10-Feb-18,False,Moto..Bring Back the notification light please!,"I've been a big Motorola fan from the flip-phone times, and it was always about battery life, connectivity and no bloatware, no gimmicks. I know, Lenovo bought Motorola, but thankfully they are sticking to the core values. Let's also remember (or if this is new for you) Motorola was actually the first mobile phone (not smartphone), the ""father of mobile phones"" was working for Motorola. It's one of the oldest American brands, going back to 1928, and they were always leading in radio communications and they got a big role in the first PCs too. As of right now Lenovo owns the name (Google owns the patents- see the Google Pixel is actually a mix of Motorola and HTC tech) , so far I think they are doing ""ok"", but not great. I actually haven't even met anyone in the past 2 years who owns/uses a Motorola phone. It's either Samsung or iPhone. To be fair, they are missing out. The bare-Android is an absolute fantastic idea (see Pixel phones if you don't believe) and no bloatware, no heavily customized skins which just rob processing power and memory and eats battery for little benefit (see : Samsung). It's a very premium device, despite being a mid-range phone, there is nothing mid range about when you use it. Granted - the camera, it's the Achilles's heel to seem like all Moto phones recently. They are definitely not bad, but not fantastic either. They take pictures and the pictures are average. But if you recently used an iphone or a samsung in the past 2-3 years, you will definitely notice the downgrade in the camera department. If you're coming from a lesser device, you will be pleasantly pleased. Now, that I mentioned the only weakness of this phone, let's talk about strengths. 1. Quality. The phone feels premium..the size is comparable to an iphone 7plus, if you're looking for a reference to imagine. It has glass back/front (the new Z2 play is aluminum back) 2. Clean Android experience with Moto gestures added. Just smooth as butter! I can't make this phone slow down or lag. I had as many apps open as possible, no lag! I temporarly had an iPhone 8 and I actually noticed lag on that while unlocking, so just think about that! 3. Battery. Ladies and Gents, this is the champion of battery life! The only comparable device with similarly good battery life is another Motorola phone! (G5plus), but this one tops that! You think your Samsung device lasted long? Or your iPhone Plus? This will definitely beat it. 4. Price. Unbeatable at this price and definitely unbeatable as it gets cheaper this year (2018) , don't let the release date of this phone scare you, this is still beating all the budget phones out there, in both fluidity of the Android system and battery life! It will run everything you wanted to run, unless you are only using phones to play the latest, most graphically intensive games, but even those will run just fine!

6053,B00XQVDW6Y,Bob,4,10-Feb-16,True,You may have trouble with activation.....,"Purchased the phone as replacement. It is sold as a ""no contract phone"". I went to activate and was told it couldn't be activated as a replacement on my plan. I asked why. Didn't get and answer. I asked is a technical reason. No answer. I explained it is just a phone and can be activated. I was transferred to a ""supervisor"" who was very helpful. I am a long time US Cellular customer so I think they went ahead and activated it. It does say ""no contract phone"" in the description but I was replacing a phone ""out of the two year contract window"" so I assumed the phone was not under contract. It is all very confusing. Bottom Line: There is no technical reason why this phone cannot be activated. That said, you may have problems getting it activated, depending on your account standing, who you speak with, and other factors. It's a phone - just activate it. You already charge almost as much to activate the phone as the phone costs, for about 10 minutes of work. People should not have to guess if they can activate and then find out that some people can and some people can't. Just received the phone. Appears of good quality but time will tell. I will update in a couple weeks.

18801,B07CHWMYHP,A.M.,5,10-Dec-18,True,Good Replacement,"I purchased this phone last week to replace a three year old Moto X Pure Edition. Ordinarily, I would not have replaced but the old phone fell and screen went blank. I was fortunate to have enough screen visibility to set backups on the phone to enable a seamless transition to this new Moto G6 Plus. The G6 Plus is a nice phone. It is very much similar to the X Pure in that it is a very basic Android, i.e. stock Android. This is a huge seller for me - no complicated overlays that drain battery life. Just a basic Android with a few Moto apps that can be disabled or not used. The phone itself is all glass and came shipped with a plastic guard. I replaced this with a more durable case. The body of the phone is quite gorgeous, but as other reviewers said, it will be a fingerprint magnet. Now I am not going into the details of the phone. Its Android so any Android user will be familiar with the OS. The phone is noticeably faster than the XPE, likely due to the higher RAM and upgraded processor. The camera is gorgeous and the picture quality is really excellent. The camera has the ability to blur background to give a bokeh effect to pictures. The IQ is sharrp - much more than the XPE. The video recording is also good and records the sound superbly, contrary to what other reviews stated. The camera is also able to record slow motion video, although admittedly I have not yet used this so cannot comment on its quality. Now, I would like to address some concerns raised in another particular review that almost threw me off from purchasing. Audio quality - I found that the audio quality is good. The phone does have Dolby Audio but I have not found this to hinder the phones ability to record sound, playback sound or to affect audio quality during phone calls. In fact, I find the opposite to be true as the Dolby Audio has equalizer settings which come in quite handy when I am streaming music via bluetooth to a connected speaker or in the car. With the Dolby Audio OFF, there appears to be no significant affect in audio quality overall and I have tested this quite a bit, particularly due to the comments I saw in another review. The XPE was superior to this phone when playing audio through the speaker phone and that's cause the XPE has stereo speakers (i.e. two speakers) compared this G6 Plus' single speaker. However, the difference is audio loudness or quality is no deal breaker as it is adequately loud. MHL/Screen Cast - A particular review suggests that the phone does not have this functionality which I said to myself was no big deal at the time of purchase as it's not a feature I use. This phone does have the screen cast functionality. Under the Settings Menu > Connected Devices, there is the option to Cast. One can also edit the swipe down from the top quick menu to include the screen cast. This cast is available and while I have not yet tried to cast to my Samsung Smart TV, I have no doubt that it will work as my old XPE had the same setting which worked flawlessly. I will say this: once I powered up the phone and had it set up and running, I did have to do three phone software updates. The update information was in Spanish so I do not know specifically what was done, but there is the possibility that the three software updates were to revise security settings or phone firmware. So, there is the possibility that the Screen Cast became available after these updates, as I never checked that functionality until after all the updates were done. So for those who require screen cast - this phone has it! Phone call audio quality - no issues here. I found that I am able to easily hear the other party during a call and the other party can easily hear me. Picture and Video quality - as said previously, this phone is superior in both regards when compared to the XPE. Yes the dual lenses at the rear stick out, but I got a Spigen case with that case, the back of the phone is flush with the cameras. I am led to believe that the other reviewer may have gotten a dud for a phone and that the speaker and microphone were both flawed, because this phone does not suffer from these issues. May have been a manufacturer defect. Such a shame because with the right phone, I am sure that that reviewer would have given 5 stars like me. It is also true that the instructions that came with the phone are in Spanish. But guess what, through the magic of internet, the phone user guides can be downloaded on a computer and this can be used to install you SIM and Micro-SD card. As I said already, the software updates were in Spanish, but this is no big deal for me. One flaw but not a deal breaker... the phone does not come preloaded with a Gallery App to view Photos and videos and to see your downloads and WhatsApp media. The default photo/video viewer is Google Photos. The old XPE has a Gallery App. I downloaded two from Play Store and found the second one to be equivalent to the Gallery App on the XPE. For those that are interested, the Gallery App I downloaded from Play Store is called ""Simple Gallery"" by ""Simple Mobile Tools"". Overall and so far, an excellent phone.

It's not top of the line, and I'll get into more detail about things that I don't like about it, but everything that I say that is negative is nitpicking. Let's start instead with what's great about it. It has great design and is beautiful. The screen is bright and almost completely covers the front of the phone. When I hold it in my hand, in every way it feels just as quality as my wife's Samsung Galaxy 10. It is responsive and doesn't lag at all. Now to my nitpicking... The battery lasts just as long as my wife's phone, and as long as my friend's Pixel 3, but I'd become accustomed to the battery on my Essential Phone. That thing lasted for 2 days in a pinch, where my new G7 needs to be charged every day. I'm not a fan of the teardrop notch. It feels very last year, because it is very last year. And finally, the camera is only good. My wife's Galaxy is much better, and my friend's Pixel 3 is light years better. It's still a good camera, just not anywhere near the top of the current camera arms race. All this is to say that this is a very good phone, just not in the top tier.

3467,B00HPP3QD6,Amazon Customer,5,10-Apr-15,True,Put Simply:,"This is the best phone I've ever owned! Hands down! No questions! Just simply the best. If you are hesitating in buying this phone, I would advise you to take the plunge. It is user friendly, highly customizable (as all Android devices are), and the reception I get with this thing ACTUALLY WORKS (as in, the phone's antenna is clearly not terrible, as with my last phone)! Verizon's prepaid plan is fantastic! A huge bargain compared to their contract plan, and you pretty much lose nothing. They even let me pick out a really cool new phone number that I really liked, as my other one grandfathered to me from AT&T apparently belonged to an old fruit company. So many mango orders from total strangers... And now, none of them will ever bother me again! You will need to set up quite a few things from scratch, however. For instance, I was used to having a full spread calendar widget and it didn't come with one as it is very bare bones. Naturally, you can just get one from the app store, whether it be Amazon or Google. The visual voicemail is also something you will need to pay for if you want it. And so on and so forth... Aside from that, everything has been smooth sailing. I bought it a grippy shell to add a pop of color and protect it better. Did I mention that this is the only phone I have been able to drop without killing? Of course, your mileage may vary, but I had a Samsung before this one and dropped it flat on it's back about a foot or two off the ground and obliterated it. With this one, I can forget it in my back pocket when I bend over, have it fall out and ricochet off the floor, and have it be completely ok. I vastly prefer the latter scenario. I would highly recommend this phone to people that want an awesome phone on a budget. They do exist, and they're waiting for you.

5332,B00OZTSY6Y,Michael S. Jones,4,10-Apr-15,True,"Nice phone, but don't expect 48 hours of battery life...","I bought this phone to replace my Droid Razr Maxx HD. The Razr Maxx HD had great battery life for about the first year too. I'm hoping the battery on this one holds out for the full 2 years. This is a nice upgrade from my old phone. It runs faster, sounds good and hasn't given me any issues. I haven't had any dropped calls either. You can ignore the 48 hour battery claims. Unless you never touch the phone, that just won't happen. I use my phone a lot and play games on it as well. I usually get 14-18 hours out of it. I LOVE the motorola additions (Moto voice, Moto Assist, Moto Actions). It's great to have the phone offer to read you an incoming text message while you are driving. I also have my phone go into ""Sleeping"" mode to keep my phone quiet and dark while I sleep BUT it still allows contacts I choose (like my wife and daughter) to ring through. For those who care about the OS, it is currently at Android 4.4.4. According to news reports, it will be updated to Jellybean 5.1 but they are not saying when. I would say the only thing I don't like when compared to my old phone, is that it does not have an SD card slot. There is no way to expand the storage. What you buy is what you get. It seems to be the way all the phones are headed these days. Overall, this is a good phone with a battery that should easily get you through the day.

Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than.

8467,B01DZJFWWS,Lake,5,1-Oct-16,True,"Great Phone, Easily activated on existing Verizon account","Awesome phone! I'm not a heavy cell phone user, so I may be easier to please than other customers. But I'm very happy with this phone, and the price is hard to beat. I have the Verizon ""Small"" plan and bought this to replace a four year old Samsung Galaxy Stellar. I used Verizon's online ""bring your own device"" portal, and I didn't have to go to a Verizon store or even talk with them on the phone or by chat to activate my account on this new phone. It was great; took maybe 20 minutes to complete the switch and test it out with incoming call, outgoing call, and text. My SIM card is a micro (not a nano) which, from what I've seen in some of these reviews, probably made the transition easier. So fellow Verizon customers, this Moto G4 is a viable option. If you go to verizonwireless.com and enter ""bring your own device"" into their site's search feature, you may be able to activate without having to deal with their customer service. The Marshmallow OS is decent; I haven't encountered any glitches. They did do away with the option from Kit Kat that allowed you to move third party apps from internal to SD storage. I preferred that option. However, this OS gives a rather odd option of using an SD card as internal memory. When you insert an SD card, you get an option to use as either external storage (for photos or files but not apps) or an extension of internal storage. So I turned the 8GB phone into a 24GB with an SD card. This does mean that the SD card is committed to this phone and can't be used to transfer stuff to another device. I hope I don't end up regretting that. This is the first cell phone that I've ever purchased having always opted for promotional phones that I could get for free if I took on a long contract. And I wasn't willing to spend $500+ (even at $20 month) or enter into another overpriced 2 year contract. This Moto G4 was a real find. I'd definitely recommend it.",1.0,Motorola,Moto G (4th Gen.)

I understand with electronics that there will be lemons from time to time, but my new phone is great. Returns and exchanges are super fast and easy. This phone is great with one major problem: the adaptive brightness. It will remember the highest setting but after a few hours it forgets the lowest setting. When going from say your normal lit house to your car at night time and you turn the phone on to use it in the car, the brightness will adjust to its bare minimum setting, which is too low. If you manually bump up the setting, it will remember it for a little bit but then it will forget., and the screen will return to its minimum brightness again. If you turn of the adaptive brightness then when going to a dimly lit area the phone will be too bright , so no matter what you are stuck manually adjusting the phone anyway. Very annoying.

It may not offer top-end power or an incredible camera experience, but if you’re on the lookout for an affordable phone that works well and reliably, you’re sure be a fan of what Motorola’s G series flagship can do. The Moto G name has become synonymous with quality on a budget. Time and again, Motorola has got this price point right with relatively high spec handsets when compared to the competition at the same price. This time, the company has taken a lot of what made the Moto G6 a solid handset and gently refined it into an even more premium feeling product. I liked the Moto G6 a lot when it came out in 2018 – so there isn’t much that needed improving on this new handset, but that’s not such a huge issue either.

26393,B07WSJYDXX,DozerCSX,5,1-Jun-19,True,Near perfect budget big screen smartphone,"Terrific new phone. I have used many phones, many Android devices, and many Motorolas - this one is the best so far. *** The single most important performance upgrade to a phone is RAM *** My most previous phone was a Motorola Moto E4, a nice, simple budget phone. But the 2GBs of RAM is terribly constraining in 2019. For simple, single use, and only one or two apps running at a time, 2GB is fine. But the moment you begin using any phone with multi-tasking, 2GB RAM simply falls on its face. In the Moto E4, it would simply overheat, stumble and slow down. I drive a car with Android Auto - the combination of the Android Auto app, Waze, GPS, music and phone calls was simply too much for 2GB RAM, and the phone would regularly freeze or simply reset. Yuk. Enter this Moto G6 Play. Screen is 5.7"" diagonal, but most importantly, 18:9 dimensions, so it's just as wide as the E4, but significantly more real estate for maps, words, and best of all, for modern 2.4:1 widescreen movies. The screen is only 720p but don't be fooled - after a few minutes you'll never notice the loss of resolution, and 720p only lights up a quarter of the pixels of 1080p, a significant power savings. Oh and re: power? This battery is 4000mah combined with the low power screen and a quad core CPU - it will last 3 days of light use, 2 days of regular use, and 1 full day of INSANE use (you know who you are). Really remarkable. But the key is the 3GB RAM in this phone - it simply doesn't stumble or balk or hesitate under most loads. The only thing which will cause it to tremble is heavy gaming, so I wouldn't recommend that - but light gaming works fine (low graphics setting). It also runs Android 8, a nice, solid, last-gen OS, with most of the bugs worked out. Easy in the hand, great screen, clear speaker, smooth operator under most loads - heck, it even comes with a ""turbo"" high amp charger, really a useful tool. My experience is that Motorola phones last a long time. And for the cost of an iPhone X you can get SIX of these! It even works on all carriers - even Sprint (my carrier). The dirty little secret is this guy is really all most folks need.

17420,B078RBVVCV,Ajazi,1,1-Jul-18,False,Problems within 2 weeks of purchase,"Okay, the bare-bones nightmares: CAMERA: Terrible. Lenovo updates the phone's camera app to try and improve image quality, but those updates result in even worse quality photos. WIFI: Freezes whenever Data is also active and whenever else it feels like. To improve the situation, manually disable Data when running wifi, and, when the connection freezes later, anyway, quickly disable and reenable wifi to pulse it. Regardless, this shouldn't have to be done on a modern smartphone. BATTERY: Yikes! Plug it in to add juice and you risk battery power actually reporting to draw down until you unplug the unit, at which time a more accurate battery reading is given. Troubleshoot by warm-booting into Safe Mode and a high battery level is shown, but the meter reading doesn't drop! It's happening to my G5S+ as of this writing. Lenovo phone text reported that it may be a third app conflicting with the phone, but doesn't say more. So I stopped using Nova Launcher and switched to the phone's baked-in Moto Launcher. No difference; the problem remains. This occurred several times throughout my ownership of this unit, with the battery reporting going bad for days then mysteriously correcting itself. Lenovo doesn't care. July 29, 2018 Battery update: it's even worse now. Plugged in for ages or not, the battery meter is always showing a low number. A recent report says this particular phone has a high failure rate and my Moto G5S Plus definitely is failing. *** So much for bare bones. I've bought Lenovo in the past - a desktop, a laptop, and a Moto Z Play - and each device has had a problem. The different is that I returned those other devices within their return period. This one I made the mistake of keeping because it started working properly.

5395,B00TFAVFL4,Amazin',4,1-Jul-15,True,"Mostly Negative, but I love this phone...","THE PROBLEMS: I want to start this with the problems that I have been experiencing with this phone. I have had this phone for two months, I love this phone, but sometimes it annoys me. The biggest problem I have had with this phone is that the messaging feature is still glitchy with lollipop. I have the screen set to turn off after one minute. Here's what happens: I text someone, I set the phone down, the phone falls asleep, when I wake the phone up and get ready to text with the already open keyboard, it doesn't work. I can just tap the keys forever and nothing will show up on the phone. I contacted Motorola customer support about the problem and they weren't able to help me. The second problem I have noticed is that sometimes the proximity sensor will just stop working. This isn't a huge deal, I just restart the phone and the proximity sensor works again. This issue only shows up every so often, it has only happened two times thus far. The proximity sensor is also one of my favorite features of this phone. You pick it up and the phone lights up like it's happy to see you. I love that. The third problem I kind of expected. Everyone talked about how laggy this phone is. It really can be laggy at times, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining. I experience the most lag when I am checking facebook or when I have too many internet pages open. This phone also has a bit of a hard time navigating google drive, but that might be because I have a ton of documents. ****Oh, and I almost forgot the worst part... the microphone is towards the back of the phone(see photo)! The first few calls I made, everyone kept yelling that they couldn't hear me. I thought it was my service because I had just switched, but that wasn't it. I did some research online and found that a lot of people were making calls only to have someone say, ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"" Everyone online recommended to use headphones or to cup your hand on the bottom of the phone while you talk. I have actually found my own technique. I talk to the back of my phone and smoosh my ear on the phone so I can hear. I look like an idiot while I talk to the back side of my phone, but it works. Also make sure to hold your hand on the top of the phone so that the proximity sensor turns the phone screen on/off so you can hang up when done. THE POSITIVE: Since everyone lists positives in their review and I know that I come to the comments to read the negative, I'll just quickly bullet point some of my favorite features of this phone. - it ties with your google account to give you all access to email and what not -the front facing speaker makes for okay music listening -the notifications go off without turning on the screen, which is awesome for the battery -with a daily texting usage and no other functions such as youtube or constant internet browsing, I get 2 days of use without charge -the phone doesn't come preloaded with a bunch of junk apps -NUMBERONE, 1st place, top pick is the camera function. I deleted the camera app off the home screen because all you have to do to get to the camera is twist your wrist two times quickly and BOOM, your camera is ready to shoot. MY SET UP: One last thing, I just wanted to go into the plan that I have setup on this phone. I looked into every phone that plan there is and then I saw that Cricket Wireless had been taken over by AT&T. So I checked them out and I got myself set up with no hassle to Cricket WIreless. I enter my info online, Cricket said you're all set, they sent a sim, I inserted sim and I was done.

3871,B00JS73V2U,rachel,1,1-Jul-14,False,If I could give this no stars I would,"I bought my Motorola DROID MAXX from Verizon on June 8th 2014. My major issue is that when I try to watch Netflix the Video is about 0.5 seconds ahead of the audio so everything seems like a very poorly dubbed foreign movie. I have called Netflix support twice, corresponded with Motorola support, and finally spoke to Verizon Support but nothing works (i have even done a factory reset). Both Verizon and Motorola blame Netflix and say there is nothing they can do but I reason that it must be something wrong with the device because my husband's 2 year old Samsung android and my iPod Touch 4th generation have always, and are currently just fine (our laptops, TV and WII are all fine too). The Netflix support suggested that the processor was over loaded and also suggested that maybe the problem would be fixed if Kitkat were to update however there is no update past 4.4 available through Verizon and the current version of Kitkat that is out is 4.4.4 so seems that Verizon has skipped 4 updates. I wonder if they plan to support this one at all. Another issue is with the size of the operating system. KitKat is 4.97GB with another 800 MB for the pre-installed apps.while when I researched the iPhone and found that iOS only uses about 3.5 GB. There is also no SD Card slot which I thought was unusual for a Android phone. Finally I have a Macbook Pro and didn't realize that in order to access or load anything on my phone I needed a special program for my computer.

3992,B00K0NS0P4,Daisy S,5,1-Jul-14,True,Motorola Moto G LTE - A Detailed Review Regarding the Many Excellent Features of This Phone.,"This excellent unlocked Moto G LTE Phone has surpassed my expectations! Before I purchased this phone on Amazon, I had a much larger phone the Samsung Galaxy Grand (5 inch display), which was just too large and heavy etc. This Moto G LTE phone is just the right size, not too large or too small! For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone. PROS: + Built in slip proof cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I purchased on Amazon a slim cover and a genuine Moto back in a Pinkish Purple and this keeps the phone protected and anti slip etc. + Screen Resolution - VERY CLEAR! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a 4.5 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful! For me, I can read everything well without my reading glasses. - + Kit Kat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that Kit Kat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with Kit Kat that I love, but they have bloat ware on them, this phone does not). + EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - For me, I added a 32GB SD card. However, there are those who add a 64gb SD card, and I have heard that these work in this phone. And for the newer updates and new apps that are Kit Kit approved/Kit Kat ready, I was able to move them over to the SD card to save space. + WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Very, very fast--in fact in the back of my home, I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. . Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other phones before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed as this one! + Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. + LTE is amazing! For me, I use AT&T and I have noticed that the LTE data is super fast loading webpages, opening emails on this phone --- it is so much faster than in my last phone with just t 3G on it, I can really tell the difference. + Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore. + Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest RocketPlayer (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound is superb! + Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried). + Battery Life- Excellent and the best I have found yet! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc). However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 15 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. + Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. + OTG - The micro USB port on this phone is OTG (On the Go) compatible, this means that if you order a OTG Adapter Cable, then you can place a flash drive, USB Mouse and more into this phone. For me, I have been able to place my 32GB Flash drive in this adapter and easily copy files from this phone to my flash drive! + Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging! + 5MP Camera - For a 5MP, actually I found that my pictures came out clearer and better when I did this: - I DO NOT USE the AUTO setting, just the flash or no flash and my pictures come out better now. My outdoor pictures I do not take in bright, bright sunlight, I take in shade and my pictures come out better. However, for more serious and highly detailed picture taking, I like to use my regular digital camera. + File Manager - I went to the Playstore and found Astro File Manager, it is easy to find my files on my SD External card and also on the phone. Liked it so much, I bought the AD FREE version! **Notes regarding the camera: I found that if I leave my flash either on or off (and do not set to AUTO), the pictures have come out so much better now (clearer with better color etc). I took some outdoor shots and indoor shots after this and found that my pictures really looked nice! CONS: - New Adobe Flash is not supported; however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play). Bottom line: Would I buy this phone over again? Yes I certainly would buy this exceptional phone all over again. If you are looking for a easy to use and reasonably priced Android smartphone that has wonderful battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.",11.0,Motorola,"Motorola Moto G (1st Generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 8GB, White",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Generation-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B00K0NS0P4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L5LzVmrcL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00K0NS0P4,1,209.75,0.0

14910,B074VFRKZG,Jeremy OBryan,4,1-Feb-19,True,Great phone if you can get the right deal but.. (read full review),"As the title states when I bought this I got the phone for $230 with prime shipping, just make sure you always check you options when buying the phone. Battery life in just the first couple days has been lasting me about 3/4 of a day but with battery saver I can run pretty much all day and then not worry. It depends on how much gaming you do with your phone or movie watching you do. My phone had like 7 updates I think and the last one updated the phone to Android pie. This phone definitely makes my last phone I paid $120 for feel like a kids toy. When it comes to features and functionality. This phone is like it was built for me. In one of the updates I think it installed Alexa for Moto assistant (you don't have to activate or use it) no it doesn't turn your unlocked phone into an Amazon prime exclusive. Even though the listing shows it that way. My kids loved the wireless sound system feature that is part of the Bluetooth system built into the phone.it allows the phone to connect up to 4 speakers or headphones to the phone at the same time. There is just so much I could say about this phone and it is a mid range phone at a mid range price. there is also a Amazon exclusive model for $200ish average price you just have Amazon apps installed and Alexa assistant installed as well. So the choice is yours. If you follow current review sites other than Amazon this phone is starting to show its age. The only thing this phone has going for it is the ipx rating really. Sure it has Android pie and security patces but it was released in late 2017 so this phone is considered 2 years old. The better replacement s by the current review sites are the g6 and the Nokia 7.1 if you want something current. If you don't mind being a little behind the game this is still a great phone, I love mine and glad I bought it. 5/1/19 Still receiving security patches, and running strong I did install Nova launcher (prime) on it to give it a little better feel over all.

Extremely disappointed in this phone UPDATE: I managed to get the phone to shut down by holding down the power and the volume buttons for several seconds. When I restarted, the google updates continued to cause the phone to freeze, requiring me to force shutdown and reboot several times. This continued until the google play updates were finished.

14667,B072ZWCKP5,A. Antonio,5,1-Dec-17,True,The Best Budget Phone I've Ever Used,"When I bought the Moto E Plus for just over $100 (non-ad version - Black Friday deal), I thought the quality would be as bad as the name. How much can you really expect out of a $100 phone? Well, it turns out, enough to put the other phone makers to shame. SCREEN: This thing is packing a HD LCD screen. That’s how they advertise it too. HD. That tricks most people. HD is 720p. Now, to be honest, most people can’t tell the difference between 720p, 1080p, 2k, and 4k on a phone, unless they put it less than an inch from their eyeball. 720p does a decent enough job. It’s nothing to write home about, but the screen is good for what it is. It’s at least a big screen which somehow makes it seem better. CAMERA: What can I say about the camera in this thing? It’s a camera. They advertise the MPs to distract from the other specs. MPs don’t mean a whole lot when it comes to quality. Other factors have a much bigger impact. However, this phone takes okay photos. It gets the job done. It’s not fast, it’s not high quality, but it takes photos as good as some cheap point and shoot cameras. HARDWARE: Well, it functions. It has enough to run Android OS. I mean it’s only packing a 400 series chip in it. It has 2GB of RAM which is going to gag if you are a power user. 2GB will run most Android functions, but you need 3GB to really be safe. If you run any games on this phone, you’ll notice that they do not look good and they can lag. This is not a phone for gaming. In terms of storage, you are looking at 16GB. That’s not good. If you take photos a lot, you’re going to hit that fast. On the plus side, you do have a micro sd slot. That’s something some of the higher end phones ignore. I always see a micro sd slot as a valuable tool, even more so if you swap phones on a regular basis. SOFTWARE: You get one of the BEST Android skins on this phone. Lenovo does it right. Well not really. Motorola did it right and Lenovo is just sticking with it. This phone is running pretty close to stock android with a few tweaks that only add functionality. I cannot complain about the software on this phone. It’s a big plus and more Android makers should follow Moto’s example here. CONNECTIVITY: I normally don’t put this in my reviews, but here it’s worth mentioning. This phone will run on ANY carrier. This phone is compatible with the big four in the US. Normally unlocked phones only target the GSM market. This one does Sprint and Verizon too. On the down side, this phone does not do wifi-calling. That’s bad news for people on Sprint. Anyone on T-Mobile doesn’t care about wifi-calling anymore. Ever since they released the wifi-calling app (DIGITS), it doesn’t really matter if a phone can do wifi calling. BUILD: When you first hold this phone, you will be blow away. Not because it feels like a flagship or high quality, because it doesn’t feel like a $100 phone. The metal build and solid feel seem like they belong to a phone that cost three or four times what this phone does. When you see the finger print reader, you wonder what it’s doing on a $100 phone. How can they afford that? The build is a big selling point here. BATTERY: And now for the biggest benefit. 5000mah. How on Earth can they afford to put a 5000mah battery in this thing? This battery is 35% bigger than most of the flagships out there and there is more to it than that. Keep in mind that this phone has half the RAM and half the processor of the flagships. Here that translates into a MUCH more efficient phone, when it comes to the task you do the most. Forget SOT time. That’s a useless statistic that can be manipulated to get a good number. In real usage, this thing gets a solid two days between charges. If you are a light user (just text, calls, emails and so on), you can get three days on a charge. This phone is like the Energizer Bunny. It just keeps going. OVERALL – This phone is a HUGE value for the money. If you need a phone that works, don’t care about bells and whistles, and don’t want to pay through the nose, this is the phone for you.",16.0,Motorola,Motorola XT1775 Moto E Plus (4th Gen.) 32GB Unlocked Fine Gold Smartphone,https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-XT1775-Moto-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B072ZWCKP5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UTxbIjXaL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072ZWCKP5,336,244.45,0.0

It didn't come with a proper user guide/manual. It came with something that was no more than a diagram of the different components of the phone. I don't feel that the action on the screen is very accurate. In other words I'll be pressing down on a button and it won't work. Now I'm aware that most phones are going to be judged for various things of this nature, but this phone is a Moto 4X and although it isn't the newest model, it isn't a very old model, I take it, either. I've never experienced the ringer on a phone all of a sudden not working, but that is what is happening on this phone, because I can't see how to fix it, there are no instructions.

A real bummer because i wsnted a motorola for a long time. thevonly claim it seems to like ive up to is that its thin.So thin i first thought I'd been cheated & that there was nothing in the box.The camera- slow, shutter lag is long, & a side by side comparison with my zte zmax pro only took a few adjustments on the zmax photo to produce the same photo, with less lag. Bootup is slow, sound is weak. ive returned the phone & am writing this from the zte with a severely broken screen. Id have ordered another phone but Amazon never told me it was awaiting another return to complete the refund. problem being that i decided to keep the other item & cancelled that return would have done so when accounting dept was in, but no agent (of 3) told me why refund was delayed till saturday, when the 4th did.despite my dire circumstances no one could make that refund available on a gift card ballance to get a new phone before the zte fails.",2.0,Motorola,"Moto Z GSM Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Black",https://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Smartphone-screen-storage-5-2mm/dp/B01LEL8ABY,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71se2LK4Y5L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01LEL8ABY,305,0.0,0.0
